    "content": "Gorilla Mind ‘Respawn’ Gaming Formula | Comprehensive Supplement Breakdown     Gorilla Mind ‘Respawn‘ is our aggressively dosed, turnkey gaming formula designed for amplified focus, clean energy, elevated mental clarity, and enhanced reaction time. It has gone through several iterations and has been in the works for over a year now, and I’m very proud of how it turned out. Despite being branded as a gaming formula, Respawn doubles as a potent nootropic and energy stack for any mentally demanding tasks, and is perfect for intense work sessions and boosting productivity. This formula is unique in that despite not being aggressively stimulant heavy, you should still feel it kick hard. Rather than just redlining your central nervous system (CNS) into staying awake, this will actually support motivation, drive, and significantly improve several cognitive performance metrics. Alright, let’s get into the attributes in a gaming context, then I'll spin off and mention how it can also be useful to those who don't game (I don't personally game except the odd game of Smash Bros).

This formula was designed to push the dopaminergic, cholinergic, and cerebral vasodilatory pathways hard. Through specific synergy of these pathways, I was able create something that yields a clear amplification of cognitive performance, and I’m stoked for you guys to try it. Flavor And Mixability When gaming, we know how important it is to have a drink that you actually enjoy sipping on. This is why it was important to us to make sure that Gorilla Mind Respawn mixed extremely well, and the flavor was on point. In my opinion, we nailed it, especially given the stacked active ingredients profile. We have several more flavors coming very soon, so there will almost certainly be a flavor you’ll like in our catalog. How To Dose Gorilla Mind Respawn Mix 1-2 scoops of Gorilla Mind Respawn in 12-14 ounces of water and consume 30 minutes prior to gaming or beginning any cognitively demanding task, preferably on an empty stomach for optimal results. Vary the amount of water to achieve your desired flavor level. First time users should begin use with ½ – 1 scoop or less to evaluate tolerance. Can Respawn Double As A Pre-Workout? Respawn can double as a pre-workout. It is fantastic for the cognitive/focus/dopaminergic drive component. The pump should also be decent at the full 2 scoop dose given the cerebral vasodilatory component extends systemically. It won’t be a replacement for something like Gorilla Mode ‘Nitric’, but it will provide a significant boost in Nitric Oxide, and could be an excellent standalone for those seeking the mental drive and energy component of pre-workouts. If maximum energy and focus are desired along with maximum performance, the highest impact combination would be using Respawn or ‘Energy’ with Nitric. I will discuss optimal combinations later in this article. Gorilla Mind Respawn Vs. Other Gaming Formulas On The Market Much like the pre-workout market in 2019, there is a severe lack of transparency and efficacy in the gaming and eSports supplementation space. In 2019, Gorilla Mode changed the trajectory of the pre-workout industry towards educated customers seeking stacked, efficacious, and transparent formulations (or at least had a significant influence on it). Gorilla Mind Respawn will have the same industry-changing impact on the gaming space This is the most potent and effective gaming formula on the market. Most gaming/eSports formulas are literally flavored Caffeine powder with pixie dusted antioxidants and amino acids. Not us. Per max dose Gorilla Mind Respawn features 5000 mg of L-Tyrosine, 2000 mg of nooLVL®, 800 mg of Alpha-GPC 50%, 400 mg of Uridine Monophasphate, 300 mg of Caffeine, 240 mg of Ginkgo Extract, 150 mg of L-Theanine, 30 mg of Saffron Extract, 400 mcg of Huperzine A, and a blend of 9 essential vitamins in their biologically active formats. Gorilla Mind Respawn Supplement Facts Per Full Daily Dose:  Vitamin C (as Ascorbic Acid) – 180 mg Thiamin (as Thiamin HCl) – 2.4 mg Riboflavin (as Riboflavin 5’-Phosphate Sodium) – 2.6 mg Niacin (as Niacinamide) – 32 mg P5P (Vitamin B6) (as Pyridoxal 5’-Phosphate) – 20 mg Methylfolate (as L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate Calcium Salt) – 1360 mcg DFE Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin) – 10 mcg Biotin – 60 mcg Pantothenic Acid (as Calcium Pantothenate) – 10 mg L-Tyrosine – 5,000 mg nooLVL® (Inositol-Enhanced Bonded Arginine Silicate) – 2,000 mg Alpha-GPC 50% (L-Alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine) – 800 mg Uridine 5’-Monophosphate – 400 mg Caffeine Anhydrous – 300 mg Ginkgo Extract (Ginkgo Biloba) (leaf) (50:1 Standardized Extract, Min. 24% Ginkgo Flavonglycosides and 6% Terpene Lactones) – 240 mg L-Theanine – 150 mg Saffron Extract (Crocus Sativus) (flower) – 30 mg Huperzine A (Huperzia serrata leaf standardized extract) – 400 mcg   Gorilla Mind Respawn Ingredients Breakdown Essential Vitamins Essential vitamins support various physiological processes, including maintaining a healthy immune system, energy metabolism, and nervous system function. They cannot be synthesized in the body in adequate amounts and must therefore be obtained from the diet. In general, most diets are deficient in one or more essential vitamins, and the synthesis of several hormones and neurotransmitters are reliant on satisfactory quantities of essential vitamins present. For example, having enough B vitamins present is critical for Dopamine synthesis.  Stressful and/or cognitively demanding situations can also deplete neurotransmitters, leading to higher essential vitamin demands. Adequate amounts of these essential vitamins can be obtained through a high-quality diet. However, to hedge against the likely chance of deficiencies, I included a complex of C and B vitamins in their biologically active formats. Vitamin C (as Ascorbic Acid) – 180 mg Vitamin C plays a role in cognitive function through several mechanisms, including its antioxidant properties, involvement in neurotransmitter synthesis, and ability to support the health and function of the brain. Some studies have suggested Vitamin C supplementation may improve cognitive performance, attention, and memory. In this formula, Vitamin C administration is most useful in how it interacts with the enzymes Tyrosine Hydroxylase and Dopamine β-Hydroxylase. Vitamin C administration has shown to increase Tyrosine Hydroxylase gene expression [R, R]. Tyrosine Hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis. It is responsible for the catalysis of Tyrosine to Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which is the precursor to the neurotransmitter Dopamine. [R, R].  Vitamin C is also a cofactor for Dopamine β-Hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts Dopamine into Norepinephrine [R, R]. The general function of Norepinephrine is to mobilize the brain and body for action by increasing alertness and vigilance. Thiamin (as Thiamin HCl) – 2.4 mg Thiamin, also known as Vitamin B1, is essential for overall health as it plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, nerve function and brain development. One human study showed an increase in reaction time from Thiamin supplementation [R]. It has been proposed that supplementing this B Vitamin may help delay the onset of cognitive decline [R]. Riboflavin (as Riboflavin 5’-Phosphate Sodium) – 2.6 mg Riboflavin, also known as Vitamin B2, plays a key role in energy metabolism, red blood cell formation, and the maintenance of healthy skin, eyes, and the nervous system. A human study involving middle-aged and elderly people found that a higher intake of riboflavin was associated with improvements in multi-dimensional cognitive functioning [R]. Niacin (as Niacinamide) – 32 mg Niacin, also known as Vitamin B3, plays a key role in energy production, the maintenance of healthy skin, nervous system function, and DNA synthesis. Niacin supplementation has been associated with improved sensory register (the short-term storage of memory received through the environment) and short-term memory. The literature available suggests that this is facilitated through enhanced neuronal transmission [R]. P5P (Vitamin B6) (as Pyridoxal 5’-Phosphate) – 20 mg Much like the other B vitamins, Vitamin B6 plays several overlapping roles in supporting optimal function. With that said, the main attribute of interest in this formula is the impact it has on the production of neurotransmitters, such as Serotonin, Dopamine, and Norepinephrine (Noradrenaline). L-DOPA (Levodopa) is the precursor to Dopamine, meaning that it is converted into Dopamine in the brain. This conversion process is facilitated by an enzyme called Aromatic Amino Acid Decarboxylase (L-Dopa Decarboxylase), which requires P5P (the active form of Vitamin B6), as a cofactor [R]. I chose to include activated Vitamin B6 (P5P) instead of the commonly used inactive Pyridoxine HCl because the conversion process directly requires P5P. In addition, literature shows that supplementing with the inactive form of Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) may competitively inhibit activated B6 from working, and could even paradoxically lead to a B6 deficiency through its supplementation [R]. Adequate B6 status is critical for downstream Dopaminergic neurotransmission. Methylfolate (as L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate Calcium Salt) – 1360 mcg DFE Folate, also known as Vitamin B9, is involved in several reactions that are essential for neurotransmitter synthesis. For example, it is required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which is a precursor to several neurotransmitters. Folate is also involved in the synthesis of S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe), which is involved in the methylation of neurotransmitter precursors and receptors, and plays a key role in adrenergic signaling. Adrenergic signaling will stimulate the fight-or-flight response via the sympathetic nervous system. Supplementation of folate has been shown to help decrease homocysteine concentrations, which may help improve memory, information processing speed, and motor skills speed [R]. I chose to include methylfolate instead of folic acid to hedge against genetically influenced conversion impairments. Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, which is commonly used in dietary supplements and fortification programs. Methylfolate, on the other hand, is the biologically active form of folate, which is found in food and is directly usable by the body. It is estimated that approximately 10-15% of the population carry one or two copies of the MTHFR C677T mutation, and up to 40% carry one copy of the MTHFR A1298C mutation. MTHFR is an enzyme that is responsible for converting folic acid to methylfolate. Individuals who carry one or two copies of the MTHFR C677T or A1298C mutations may have reduced activity of the MTHFR enzyme, which can impair the conversion of folic acid to methylfolate. This can lead to a buildup of unmetabolized folic acid in the blood and a decrease in these individuals’ levels of methylfolate. Personally, I have two copies of the MTHFR C677T mutation, which results in only 10-20% the efficiency in processing folic acid and can lead to high homocysteine, low B12 and low folate levels. Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin) – 10 mcg Vitamin B12 is required for the development, myelination, and function of the central nervous system. [R] Contextually in this formula, Vitamin B12 acts as a cofactor in synthesis of neurotransmitters such as Serotonin and Dopamine. [R] B12 deficiency can lead to decreased production of neurotransmitters and affect cognitive function, causing symptoms such as fatigue and lethargy [R]. Cyanocobalamin and methylcobalamin are two forms of vitamin B12. Methylcobalamin is the biologically active form and cyanocobalamin is the most common form found in supplements and fortified foods. I included methylcobalamin in this formula because it is a better methyl donor compared to cyanocobalamin, and some studies have suggested that methylcobalamin supplementation may have a positive impact on neurotransmitter function. Biotin – 60 mcg Biotin, also known as Vitamin B7, is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, including decarboxylases, which are involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as Dopamine, Serotonin, and GABA. There is evidence to suggest that biotin supplementation may have a positive impact on neurotransmitter function and may help to support healthy mood and cognitive function [R, R]. Pantothenic Acid (as Calcium Pantothenate) – 10 mg Pantothenic Acid, also known as Vitamin B5, is involved in various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of neurotransmitters, and it is a component of coenzyme A (CoA). Pantothenic acid can play a vital role in maintaining adequate levels of acetylcholine as well as attenuating neurodegeneration and myelin loss [R]. L-Tyrosine – 5,000 mg L-Tyrosine is an amino acid that is used by the body to produce proteins and neurotransmitters, including Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Epinephrine. These neurotransmitters play important roles in regulating mood, energy levels, and stress response. Anecdotally, L-Tyrosine tends to be taken in doses of 500-2000 mg 30-60 minutes before cognitively demanding work or exercise. The Pathway For Catecholamine And Trace Amine Synthesis The following is a visual representation of the pathway for catecholamine and trace amine synthesis in the human brain:  All catecholamines are synthesized from the amino acid L-Tyrosine according to the following sequence: L-Tyrosine → L-DOPA (Levodopa) → Dopamine → Norepinephrine (Noradrenaline) → Epinephrine (Adrenaline). Supplementing with L-Tyrosine has been shown to have potential benefits for cognitive function, particularly in stressful or fatigue-inducing environments, by increasing the synthesis of these neurotransmitters. Effect On Reaction Time And Vigilance L-Tyrosine usage acutely augments reaction time and vigilance and has been shown to attenuate performance impairments induced by high levels of environmental stress [R]. Effect On Memory And Military Tracking Performance Several studies have shown that L-Tyrosine supports working memory, even during periods of extreme stress [R, R, R]. In another unique study, Tyrosine was given to 21 cadets during a demanding military combat training course. The cadets supplied with the Tyrosine performed better on a memory and a tracking task [R]. It’s easy to see where these findings have practical utility in a gaming context, especially with so many games requiring incredibly quick reflexes, accuracy, map awareness, peaked working memory, and tracking. Dextroamphetamine Vs. L-Tyrosine Sleep Deprivation Study L-Tyrosine usage has been shown to overcome certain cognitive performance deficits due to prolonged sleep deprivation, including running memory, logical reasoning, mathematical processing, and visual vigilance [R]. In this study, 76 healthy male volunteers who ranged in age from 18–35 years were sleep deprived for 30 hours, and then given either placebo, Dextroamphetamine, Phentermine, Caffeine, or L-Tyrosine, and metrics of cognitive performance were assessed. While Tyrosine did not perform as well as Dextroamphetamine in some tasks, it still attenuated cognitive performance deficits in several metrics caused by sleep deprivation, and outperformed Dextroamphetamine in mathematical processing at the 1.5 hour post-administration mark, and logical reasoning task assessment at the 5.5 hour post-administration mark [R]. Logical reasoning is a mental activity that aims to arrive at a conclusion in a rigorous manner. In this study the logical reasoning performance measures were response latency per response and number of errors per session. For a natural compound with a superior safety profile, this is a very promising outcome. Effect On Cognitive Flexibility In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design, 22 healthy adults performed in a task-switching paradigm. Administration of 2000 mg of L-Tyrosine was shown to promote cognitive flexibility (the ability to switch between thinking about two different concepts or to think about multiple concepts simultaneously) [R]. L-Tyrosine Vs. N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine L-Tyrosine is the most bioavailable form of Tyrosine, or so I thought. N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine is very inefficiently converted by the body to Tyrosine after IV infusion [R].  The graph above depicts arterial concentrations of N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine and Tyrosine during intravenous infusion of N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine. As you can see, Tyrosine levels barely even budged. In our first batch of Gorilla Mind in 2018, we had N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine in the formula based on marketing claims I had heard of improved water solubility. After delving into the data further, I swapped out the N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine for straight L-Tyrosine because none of the N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine data showed efficient conversion to L-Tyrosine. My stance a few years ago was that N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine was a waste of money and just a marketing ploy. However, over the past few years I’ve heard several anecdotes of individuals getting clear benefits from using N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine. It was too much to ignore at a point, so I revisited the data and discovered something that has made me pivot my stance on this ingredient. Every single study showing inefficient conversion is utilizing IV infusion of N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine to assess how much it raises Tyrosine levels! Now, on the surface, most (including myself when I first read that study) assumed that if during an IV administration (where you achieve 100% bioavailability) you still aren't getting efficient conversion of N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine to L-Tyrosine, and the majority of it is showing to be urinated out as intact N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine, then it’s probably totally useless, and the only option is to use L-Tyrosine or nothing. But when you look at the overlapping data on N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), we start to get a clearer picture about what I speculate is going on. In the same study showing inefficient N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine to L-Tyrosine conversion, we see a similar result reflected with N-Acetylcysteine inefficiently converting to Cysteine.  Now that I have learned more about pharmacokinetics, I suspect that oral ingestion of N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine is required to have efficient conversion, and the IV administration itself is the reason why the N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine failed to increase Tyrosine levels in those studies. N-Acetylcysteine is a commonly used supplement and a precursor to Glutathione, and it is widely accepted that it works extremely well. When consumed, NAC is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and is then converted to cysteine in the liver [R]. The liver uses Cysteine to produce Glutathione, which is then used locally for Glutathione synthesis or transported throughout the body to individual tissues [R]. After a drug is swallowed, it is absorbed by the digestive system and enters the hepatic portal system, where it is then carried through the portal vein into the liver for metabolism before it reaches the rest of the body. The extent to which something is metabolized depends on numerous factors, but the main takeaway is that first pass metabolism can have a significant transformative effect on the pharmacodynamics of a parent compound. The oral ingestion of a drug may metabolize into nothingness, which is often why some drugs aren’t orally bioavailable. The metabolites the liver spits out may be what yields the main effects desired from the parent compound, or in the case of NAC and N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine, first pass metabolism may be what is necessary for adequate deacetylation into Cysteine and Tyrosine. First pass metabolism may occur in the gut or in the liver. IV administration skips first pass metabolism [R]. If first pass metabolism after oral ingestion is what is responsible for a significant amount of the deacetylation process of N-Acetylcysteine into Cysteine, then it is plausible to assume that when orally ingested, N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine may readily convert to L-Tyrosine. Under this assumption, skipping the first pass effect via IV administration would have been responsible for the poor N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine conversion data in previous studies. In the study mentioned at the beginning of this subsection, after IV’ing N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine and N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) into humans, the researchers concluded that “under these conditions the usefulness of NALT and NAC as precursors for the corresponding amino acids in humans is not apparent” [R]. Orally ingested N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), as a nutritional supplement, has hordes of literature supporting that it is clearly a “powerful antioxidant” and does convert readily to Cysteine, and increase Glutathione levels thereafter [R]. I strongly suspect that N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine is potent and useful as well. I will continue to use L-Tyrosine in our powder and capsule formulas, because ultimately, we are just skipping the deacetylation process and providing the body with straight L-Tyrosine instead, which is more efficient. However, in ready to drink preparations, such as energy drinks *wink wink*, L-Tyrosine is not water soluble and cannot be suspended in any reasonable quantity, but N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine can. This is where N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine holds the highest potential utility in my opinion. nooLVL® (Inositol-Enhanced Bonded Arginine Silicate) – 2,000 mg nooLVL, a patented complex of Inositol-stabilized Arginine Silicate, has been shown to increase perceived energy, focus and accuracy in less than 15 minutes after dosing [R]. Nutrition 21 also boasts a 66% reduction in errors among the gamers dosed with nooLVL in their first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One of the reasons nooLVL is so promising is that it accomplishes this without negatively affecting heart rate or blood pressure. nooLVL works through a totally different mechanism of action than CNS stimulants, cholinergics, and other more traditional Nootropics. It works by increasing nitric oxide (NO) production, and more specifically appears to act as a potent cerebral vasodilator. It is the first eSports ingredient to be clinically studied in gamers and has 31 supporting research studies to date. Acute Effects Of nooLVL On Gamers’ Perceived Energy, Focus, Accuracy, Error Frequency And Anger In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 60 healthy men and women (18-40 years old) who on average spent 5 or more hours a week playing video games for 6 months prior to screening, were given nooLVL or placebo for 7 consecutive days [R]. Energy Levels Energy levels were evaluated prior to dosing, approximately 15 minutes after dosing, and after 60 minutes of gaming on day 1 and day 7. After a single dose on day 1, perceived energy increased in the nooLVL group, while perceived energy decreased in the placebo group. Focus, Accuracy And Error Frequency The Trail Making Test (TMT) parts A and B were used to assess cognitive function. The TMT is a validated and commonly used neuropsychological test that measures focus, cognitive processing speed, visual attention, task switching, and executive functioning [R].  After a single dose on day 1, nooLVL resulted in 66% less errors and significantly improved accuracy compared to the placebo group.  Before, and immediately after gaming, the effectiveness of nooLVL on cognitive performance was also assessed using the Stroop test. The Stroop test is a neurocognitive test that measures the interference of conflicting stimuli to determine a person’s selective attention capacity and skills, processing speed, decision making and overall executive processing abilities. Study results showed that Stroop test time was significantly faster as well as errors significantly reduced in the nooLVL group after 60 minutes of gaming, compared to a non-significant change in the placebo group.  Decreased Anger And “Tilt” Professional and casual gamers often deal with ‘gaming rage'. Gaming rage refers to the intense frustration and anger people experience while playing video games, typically due to losing, being repeatedly defeated, or encountering technical difficulties. This type of anger can often lead to “tilt”, which is essentially when an emotional reaction to in-game events causes a slew of poor decision making and deterioration in gameplay. One of the double-blind placebo-controlled studies that I referenced previously also conducted a POMS (Profile of Mood States) test that examined tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment on a five-point scale. Anger levels decreased among those taking nooLVL prior to gaming [R]. Effects Of nooLVL On Working Memory, Reaction Time, Accuracy, Energy, Mental Fatigue And Concentration In Experienced Gamers In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 26 male and female experienced gamers were randomly assigned to consume 1600 mg of Inositol-enhanced bonded Arginine Silicate (nooLVL) or placebo [R]. During the trial, participants performed cognitive function tests such as the Sternberg Task Test (STT). The STT measures short-term/working memory involving cognitive control processes, using reaction time and accuracy. The participants were tested pre-supplementation, 15-min post-supplementation and after 1 hour of video game play, intended to mentally fatigue the participants. Statistical significance was noted for several Sternberg measures including significant improvements in mean present reaction time.  This data provides evidence of enhanced working memory, reaction time, reasoning, and concentration among experienced gamers. The data from this trial further supports the use of nooLVL as a gaming ingredient to increase perceived energy, focus and accuracy. Effects Of nooLVL On Vasodilation The bonded Arginine Silicate in nooLVL enhances cognitive performance by promoting factors that improve blood flow [R]. In an open-label, pharmacokinetics clinical trial, 10 men took 500 mg of the bonded Arginine Silicate in nooLVL every day for 14 days [R]. The men were randomly assigned to take a single oral dose of bonded Arginine Silicate or Arginine Hydrochloride. This study showed that bonded Arginine Silicate supplementation significantly increased plasma Arginine levels at multiple time-points up to 6 hours post-dose, while Arginine Hydrochloride supplementation did so for only 1 hour.  This study also showed that bonded Arginine Silicate supplementation resulted in a >70% increase in plasma Arginine area under the curve compared to Arginine Hydrochloride, and showed a lower standard deviation than that seen with Arginine Hydrochloride, suggesting that Bonded Arginine Silicate is a more bioavailable, and less variable, source of arginine. Nitric oxide (NO) is undoubtedly quite an important intercellular messenger in cerebral and peripheral hemodynamics and plays pivotal roles in the regulation of cerebral blood flow, so it’s not unexpected that a potent NO precursor might have some positive impact on cognitive function [R]. nooLVL® Vs. Arginine Paradoxically, ingesting pure Arginine is not one of the most efficient ways to increase Arginine levels in the body. Pure Arginine is significantly degraded in the gut during first pass metabolism [R]. By bonding Arginine with Inositol and Silicate, nooLVL is buffered and left intact after first pass metabolism [R, R]. This is accomplished via the Arginase inhibiting properties of the complex [R]. Arginase is the specific enzyme that breaks down Arginine in the gut, and by inhibiting it, you can prolong the breakdown of NO, achieve higher levels of vasodilation, and maintain those higher levels for much longer. Alpha GPC 50% (L-Alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine) – 800 mg L-Alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine (Alpha-GPC) is the highest quality and most bioavailable form of Choline that crosses the blood-brain barrier. Taking massive dosages of Choline Bitartrate has been shown to have no cognitive effect in humans [R]. Alpha-GPC on the other hand has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and provide the brain with a rapidly absorbed form of Choline [R]. Choline is needed for the synthesis of cell membranes, lipid metabolism, DNA synthesis, homocysteine metabolism, as well as to produce Acetylcholine. The surge of quickly absorbed Choline followed by the synthesis of Acetylcholine helps support an array of functions including, but not limited to, memory, focus, HGH production, and physical performance [R, R, R, R]. Memory, Focus And Overall Cognitive Function A 1993 randomized, controlled study compared the efficacy of Alpha-GPC and Acetyl-L-Carnitine among 126 patients with probable cognitive decline, particularly memory loss [R]. Alpha-GPC consistently showed favorable effects in improving neuropsychological and behavioural test scores of the patients. Improvements also occurred in the Acetyl-L-Carnitine recipients, but to a lesser extent.  A 2003 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted on 261 patients found that Alpha-GPC administration significantly improved memory and attention in older adults with cognitive impairment compared to a placebo group, and that Alpha-GPC may be useful for improving cognitive function [R]. The authors hypothesized that the clinical results gained with Alpha-GPC may be ascribed to both its effects on neurotransmission, and its activity in slowing the age-related loss of neuronal cells. A 2007 review of Cholinergic precursors found that Alpha-GPC administration appears to have a significant attenuative effect on the memory and attention impairment caused by neurodegenerative disorders [R]. It also showed that 1200 mg of Alpha-GPC is more efficacious than Donepezil (a pharmaceutical acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) is at the maximum recommended dose prescribed for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease [R].  A 2008 study found that Alpha-GPC administration improved attention and reaction time in healthy young adults compared to a placebo group. The researchers suggested that Alpha-GPC may be useful for improving focus and attention in healthy individuals. A 2015 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study found that 200 mg of Alpha-GPC improved concentration in young adults more than 200 mg of Caffeine [R]. HGH Production A 2008 randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design study featuring 7 men with at least two years of resistance training experience examined the effects of an Alpha-GPC supplement on serum GH levels [R]. Compared to baseline, peak GH levels increased 44-fold after Alpha-GPC ingestion vs. 2.6-fold after placebo ingestion.  A 2012 double-blind randomized crossover study was designed to investigate acute physiologic responses to a single 1000 mg dose of Alpha-GPC [R]. Plasma GH levels were increased by approximately 290% 60 minutes after the oral administration of Alpha-GPC.  Force Production And Power Output In addition, Alpha-GPC has been shown to significantly increase force production and power output, and may be an effective ergogenic aid. A study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition investigated the effects of Alpha-GPC supplementation on isometric strength in 19 healthy, resistance-trained men. Participants had at least one year of resistance training experience and were required to have a current one-repetition maximum (1RM) squat of at least 1.5 times their bodyweight. Participants were randomly assigned to either take 300 mg of Alpha-GPC daily for four weeks, or a placebo daily for four weeks. The study found that Alpha-GPC supplementation resulted in a statistically significant increase in isometric strength compared to placebo. The Alpha-GPC group had a 14.8% increase in isometric strength, while the placebo group had a 4.6% increase in isometric strength. A 2008 randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design study featuring 7 men with at least 2 years of resistance training experience examined the effects of an Alpha-GPC supplement on explosive performance, and post-exercise substrate oxidation [R]. Each participant ingested 600 mg of Alpha-GPC or a placebo 90-minutes prior to completing 6 sets × 10 repetitions of Smith machine squats at 70% of their pre-determined 1-repetition maximum. Compared to baseline, peak bench press force increased by 14% after Alpha-GPC ingestion vs. placebo. A 2015 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study with 20 young participants (10 males, 10 females; 22.0 ± 3.4 years of age) measured the acute effects of Alpha-GPC supplementation on peak power output via a vertical jump test in comparison to Caffeine or placebo [R]. Vertical jump peak power was 8.5% higher than placebo after taking 200 mg of Alpha-GPC, 7.5% higher than placebo after taking 400 mg of Alpha-GPC, and 2% higher than placebo after taking 200 mg of Caffeine.  The same study also measured the acute effects of Alpha-GPC supplementation on cognitive function in comparison to Caffeine or placebo. One of the tests used to assess cognitive function metrics was the serial subtraction test (SST). The SST is a clinical test used to test cognition and concentration. SST scores after taking 200 mg of Alpha-GPC were 18.1% faster than after taking 200 mg of Caffeine, and 10.5% faster than after taking placebo. Another 2015 randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study was conducted to determine if 6 days of supplementation with Alpha-GPC would augment isometric force production compared to a placebo [R]. 13 college-aged males used either 600 mg per day of Alpha-GPC or placebo and at the end of 6 days performed isometric mid-thigh pulls and an upper body isometric test. Alpha-GPC had a significant effect on increasing isometric mid-thigh pull peak force.  A 2017 study was designed to assess the efficacy of 250 mg of Alpha-GPC and 500 mg of Alpha-GPC in comparison to placebo and 200 mg of caffeine for increasing countermovement jump performance, isometric strength, and psychomotor function [R]. Group differences were noted for maximum velocity and maximum mechanical power on the countermovement jump with the 250 mg Alpha-GPC group demonstrating the greatest improvements in result. A depression in circulating TSH levels was noted with the 500 mg dosage of Alpha-GPC, suggesting that there may be significant satellite dopaminergic interplay, as it is known that increased central Dopamine levels reduce TSH levels [R]. Motivation Levels Alpha-GPC has also more recently been shown to improve motivation levels [R]. A 2021 study conducted on 40 healthy volunteers (31 females, 9 males) aged 22–59 assessed their emotional state in response to Alpha-GPC supplementation. Participants were administered capsules containing either 200 mg of Alpha-GPC, or cellulose (placebo). The participants self-administered 2 capsules, once daily at bedtime for 2 weeks, for a total daily dose of 400 mg Alpha-GPC in the treatment group. The KOKORO scale was used to quantify and monitor changes in human feelings and emotions. The KOKORO scale is a system applied in psychological surveys to evaluate “emotional movement” in the fields of academia, government, and industry. The placebo had no effect on motivation, whereas the Alpha-GPC group showed an increasing trend in motivation during the intervention period. Alpha-GPC Vs. CDP Choline In general, the main reason we would use either Alpha-GPC or CDP-Choline is to have them cross the blood-brain barrier to provide the brain with Choline. Alpha-GPC accomplishes this better than CDP-Choline. Alpha-GPC is typically 50% Choline by weight, whereas CDP-Choline is only 18.5% Choline by weight. An open clinical trial carried out to compare the efficacy and the tolerability of 1000 mg per day of Alpha-GPC against 1000 mg per day of CDP-Choline found that in most tests, Alpha-GPC possessed a statistical higher efficacy and an overall more satisfactory activity, assessed by both patients and investigators compared with CDP-Choline [R]. One reason CDP-Choline may be attractive is that it is a Uridine prodrug, and readily dissociates into both free Choline and Cytidine following oral ingestion. In humans, Cytidine metabolizes into Uridine, which is a very potent Nootropic. Instead of including CDP-Choline, which would ultimately dissociate into a proportionally lower amount of Choline and Cytidine (which would need to go through a multi-step conversion process to end up as some unpredictable amount of Uridine), I instead included a high dose of Alpha-GPC and Uridine Monophosphate in this formula. This way I was able to control the Uridine yield and bypass the less efficient and unpredictable metabolism of Cytidine > Cytidine Monophosphate > Uridine Monophosphate > Uridine. In general, anecdotes from reputable longevity researchers also seem to reinforce the superiority of Alpha-GPC over CDP-Choline. Rhonda Patrick's Personal Opinion On Alpha-GPC Vs. CDP-Choline https://moreplatesmoredates.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Rhonda-Patrick-Alpha-GPC-CDP-Choline-comparison.mp3 “I have personally tried CDP-Choline and never really noticed any enhancing effect like I seemed to with Alpha GPC”. – Rhonda Patrick (Ph.D in biomedical science/expert on nutritional health, brain & aging) Uridine 5′-Monophosphate – 400 mg Uridine Monophosphate is a nucleotide that is involved in the synthesis of cellular membranes and the production of neurotransmitters. Data suggests that Uridine Monophosphate may improve cognitive performance via increased synthesis of brain-specific phospholipids and the enhancement of synaptic plasticity. This compound has been shown to interact in unique and synergistic ways with both the cholinergic and dopaminergic pathways. These effects are most noticeable when Uridine Monophosphate is stacked alongside central nervous system stimulants, dopaminergic drugs, or other cholinergic compounds. Users often report being more productive, task oriented and focused when taking Uridine Monophosphate. Reduced procrastination and brain fog are also common anecdotes after its use. Uridine Vs. Uridine Monophosphate (Uridine 5′-monophosphate/UMP) Uridine is naturally present in some foods in the form of ribonucleic acid (RNA). This includes, but is not limited to, organ meats like liver and pancreas, brewer’s yeast, tomatoes, goat's and sheep's milk, sugarcane extract, beer, and broccoli. There is conflicting evidence as to how bioavailable Uridine is in the form of RNA in food, however, Uridine Monophosphate has been shown to be both bioavailable and able to enter circulation from the digestive tract. Modulation Of CNS Stimulant Effects And Unique Dopaminergic Activity Uridine’s Effects In Conjunction With Amphetamines And Cocaine In a study assessing Uridine and stimulant-induced motor activity, Uridine-treated rats exhibited a significant increase in the sensitivity to Amphetamine and Cocaine during rotation tests [R].   The neurotoxin 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine) is commonly used in animal models to selectively destroy dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain that plays a key role in motor control, to mimic the loss of Dopamine neurons seen in individuals with Parkinson's disease [R]. Unilaterally-lesioned 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine) mice ‘rotate’ because of the loss of Dopamine-producing neurons in one hemisphere of the brain, which leads to an imbalance in Dopamine levels between the two hemispheres. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps to regulate movement, and the loss of Dopamine-producing neurons in one hemisphere of the brain leads to a reduction in Dopamine levels on that side. This Dopamine depletion causes an asymmetry in the activity of the basal ganglia, a group of brain structures involved in motor control. The resulting imbalance in activity between the two hemispheres leads to a rotational behavior in the mouse, where it continuously turns in one direction.  This rotational behavior is a classic hallmark of the 6-OHDA unilateral lesion model of Parkinson's disease and is commonly used as a measure of motor deficits in preclinical studies. The greater the bias towards rotating in one direction, the more parkinsonian the animal [R]. Amphetamine works by increasing the release of Dopamine from the presynaptic neuron and blocking the reuptake of dopamine, thereby increasing dopamine levels in the synaptic cleft. This results in a surge of Dopamine release, leading to feelings of euphoria, increased energy, and alertness. Cocaine, on the other hand, works primarily by blocking the reuptake of Dopamine, leading to an accumulation of Dopamine in the synaptic cleft. This also results in increased Dopamine levels in the brain, leading to feelings of pleasure, increased energy, and heightened arousal. Both drugs can have similar effects on Dopamine, but Amphetamine tends to produce a more prolonged and sustained increase in Dopamine release, while Cocaine has a shorter and more intense effect on Dopamine levels. Additionally, Amphetamine can also affect the release and reuptake of other neurotransmitters, such as Norepinephrine and Serotonin, which can contribute to its overall effects on mood and behavior. When Amphetamine or Cocaine is administered to unilaterally-lesioned 6-OHDA mice, these drugs can enhance the release and/or block the reuptake of Dopamine in the remaining hemisphere of the brain, leading to an even greater imbalance in Dopamine levels between the two hemispheres.  This further exacerbates the rotational behavior in the mice, leading to increased turning in the same direction. Paradoxically, despite exhibiting a clear potentiation of dopaminergic behavior, Uridine has shown to slightly reduce Amphetamine induced Dopamine release in some instances. The results of the study show that Uridine does not affect Dopamine-mediated behaviors when administered by itself, but appears to alter Dopamine transmission when combined with various dopaminergic agents. Its effects on enhancing Dopamine-related behaviors, with a concurrent inhibition of the Amphetamine induced Dopamine released necessary to achieve that level of stimulation, implies that it has a positive influence on Dopamine receptor sensitivity. Restorative Potential Of Destroyed Dopaminergic Neurons Other studies have shown different, equally interesting findings. Another rodent model assessed the impact Uridine and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) have on Dextroamphetamine treated rats with partial unilateral 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine)-induced striatal lesions [R]. In this study, both Uridine Monophosphate and DHA reduced Dextroamphetamine induced rotations, but significantly elevated striatal Dopamine levels, Tyrosine Hydroxylase activity, Tyrosine Hydroxylase protein and synapsin-1 on the lesioned side. Normally in these lesioned rats, this reduction in rotations would imply an inhibitory effect on dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, in this case we can see that Uridine has partially restored destroyed dopaminergic neurons to such an extent that the restored dopaminergic neurotransmission potential on the lesioned side is now seemingly evening out the stimulant induced rotations that otherwise would’ve been disproportionately higher in a more parkinsonian rat. The authors of the study concluded that giving Uridine and DHA may partially restore dopaminergic neurotransmission in this model of Parkinson’s Disease. This is not just promising for the potential efficacy of Uridine and its complementary effects with other Nootropics, but also for the potential Dopamine receptor density/sensitivity upregulation it could have in those who have a high stimulant tolerance, have abused stimulants in the past, or those seeking general cognitive support/neuroprotection. Cholinergic Effects Uridine Monophosphate is also a cholinergic agent and has potent synergy alongside choline-containing phospholipids like Alpha-GPC, and Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like Huperzine A [R, R]. The pathway in which Uridine increases brain concentrations of Phosphatidylcholine is called the ‘Kennedy Pathway’. The Kennedy Pathway is a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert CDP-Choline, Cytidine, and Uridine into phospholipids such as Phosphatidylcholine and Phosphatidylethanolamine [R].  Through this pathway, Uridine can influence many cognitive functions, including memory, learning and attention [R]. Although CDP-Choline is a cofactor in Phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis via the Kennedy Pathway, orally ingested CDP-Choline is dissociated completely and is a prodrug for Cytidine and Choline [R, R]. Oral ingestion of CDP-Choline does not raise plasma CDP-Choline levels. Instead, it raises plasma Cytidine and Choline levels. Mood Modulating Effects Uridine has been shown to have anxiolytic effects, meaning it may reduce anxiety levels [R]. It has also been shown to act as a potent mood stabilizer in depressed adolescents with bipolar disorder [R].  Caffeine Anhydrous – 300 mg Caffeine is the most well-known central nervous system stimulant on earth. It is well known for its potent effects on wakefulness, alertness, and attentional performance. When a person is awake and alert, little Adenosine is present in CNS neurons. Throughout the day, Adenosine accumulates in the neuronal synapse, binding to and activating Adenosine receptors found on certain CNS neurons. The activation of Adenosine receptors increases sleepiness. When Caffeine is consumed, it binds to and antagonizes Adenosine receptors, preventing Adenosine from binding to and activating the receptor. As a result, Caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness. Increased Alertness, Wakefulness And Readiness Via Adenosine receptor antagonism, Caffeine can increase feelings of wakefulness, alertness, and arousal [R]. Caffeine can delay or prevent sleep, and improve task performance during sleep deprivation [R]. Shift workers who use Caffeine make fewer mistakes that could be a result of drowsiness [R]. Improved Attention And Concentration Caffeine can enhance cognitive performance on tasks that require sustained attention and concentration [R]. This effect is thought to be related to Caffeine's ability to increase the release of Dopamine and Norepinephrine in the brain, which are neurotransmitters that play a role in attention and focus [R, R]. A literature review of all available double-blind, placebo controlled studies that assessed acute effects of Caffeine on attention tasks found that Caffeine clearly improved performance on simple and complex tasks [R]. Enhanced Working Memory Caffeine has been shown to improve working memory performance, which involves the ability to temporarily store information in the mind while solving a problem or performing a task [R]. An example of a working memory task could be holding an address in mind while listening to instructions about how to get there. Caffeine also affects the cholinergic system, where it promotes Acetylcholine release and acts as a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme Acetylcholinesterase, thus inhibiting the breakdown of Acetylcholine and influencing working memory and attention [R, R]. Faster Reaction Time Caffeine can improve reaction times, allowing people to respond more quickly to stimuli. One study conducted on sleep deprived anesthesiology resident physicians assessed the effect Caffeine had on their driving performance [R]. Residency training in anesthesiology involves care of hospitalized patients and necessitates overnight work, resulting in altered sleep patterns and sleep deprivation. 26 residents participated in the study and were randomly chosen to either consume a 160 mg caffeinated or a non-caffeinated energy drink 60 minutes before driving in a virtual reality simulator immediately after 6 consecutive night-float shifts. After a subsequent week of night-float work, residents performed the same driving session (in a crossover fashion) with the opposite intervention. Psychomotor vigilance task testing was used to evaluate reaction time and lapses in attention. After consuming a caffeinated energy drink on conclusion of 6 shifts of night-float work, anesthesiology residents had improved control of driving performance variables in a high-fidelity driving simulator, including a significant reduction in collisions as well as slightly faster reaction times.  Reduced Mental Fatigue Caffeine can reduce feelings of mental fatigue, making it easier to stay focused and engaged in cognitive tasks [R, R]. Caffeine Dosage The Minimum Effective Dose The minimum effective dose of Caffeine varies depending on several factors, including an individual's body weight, tolerance to Caffeine, and sensitivity to its effects. Research suggests that the minimum effective dose of Caffeine is likely around 40-50 mg, which is roughly equivalent to a small cup of coffee [R]. However, other studies assessing just how low of a dose can yield positive effects have found that surprisingly low dosages still move the needle. A double-blind study measured the effects of 0, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mg Caffeine on cognitive performance, mood, and thirst in adults with low and moderate to high habitual caffeine intakes [R]. 12.5 mg Caffeine improved cognitive performance during both simple and stressful demanding tasks. This amount of Caffeine is equivalent to about a quarter of a serving of tea, and less than a quarter of a serving of coffee. On a body weight basis, 12.5 mg equated to 0.18 mg/kg. At the time, that was reported to be the lowest dose of Caffeine to reliably affect cognitive performance in human adults. Dosage For Mental Or Physical Performance Following low (∼40mg or ∼0.5mgkg-1) to moderate (∼300mg or 4mgkg-1) Caffeine doses, alertness, vigilance, attention, reaction time and attention improve. However, less consistent effects are observed on memory and higher-order executive function, such as judgment and decision making [R]. In terms of physical performance, the minimum effective dose of Caffeine for improving metrics such as time-to-exhaustion, muscle strength, endurance, and high-intensity sprints has been shown to be around 3-6 mg/kg of body weight, or roughly 200-400 mg for a 150-pound (68 kg) person [R]. All that said, it's worth noting that some people may experience both cognitive and physical performance benefits at lower doses, while others may require higher doses to see an effect. Generally, healthy adults can safely consume up to 400 mg of Caffeine per day [R]. Ginkgo Extract (Ginko Biloba) – 240 mg Ginkgo Biloba is a popular herbal supplement that has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine to improve cognitive function. While the exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, Ginkgo Biloba is believed to exert its effects by improving cerebral blood flow, reducing oxidative stress, and modulating neurotransmitter activity. Cerebral Blood Flow Complementing the vasodilation attributes of nooLVL, Ginkgo Biloba has shown to enhance cerebral blood flow. A double-blind study conducted on 48 men found that 80 mg of Ginkgo Biloba extract taken once per day over a period of 8 months increased cerebral perfusion, as well as enhanced general intelligence, visuospatial abilities, attentional processes and information processing speed [R]. In a 2011 study, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 9 healthy men, before and after 4 weeks of taking 60 mg of Ginkgo Biloba extract twice daily [R]. A mild increase in cerebral blood flow was found in the left parietal-occipital white matter after Ginkgo Biloba extract was taken, as well as a small, but statistically significant increase in global cerebral blood flow. A larger sample size will be needed to confirm this finding, but it is notable nonetheless. Processing Speed And Accuracy A 6-week, double-blind, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel-group experimental design study assessed the short-term effects of Ginkgo Biloba extract at a dose of 180 mg per day on 48 cognitively intact participants [R]. Participants who received 180 mg of Ginkgo Biloba extract daily exhibited significant improvement on a task assessing speed of processing abilities by the end of treatment as compared to participants who received placebo. Trends indicating improved performances in the Ginkgo Biloba extract group were also demonstrated in three of the four remaining tasks that involved a timed speed of processing component, although they did not reach statistical significance. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted on 20 healthy young adults there was a dose-dependent improvement in speed of responding during a Serial Threes test following Ginkgo Biloba extract ingestion [R].  In the Serial Threes test, individuals were asked to successively subtract ‘3' from ‘100' continuously until instructed to stop. The Serial Threes test evaluates concentration and attention, as it requires sequential registration, recall and mental manipulation of numbers. Memory A 2002 trial found that a single dose of 360 mg of Ginkgo Biloba extract improved secondary memory performance in healthy young adults [R]. A large-scaled 6-week, randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial assessed the efficacy Ginkgo Biloba extract dosed at 180 mg per day in 262 volunteers, 60 years of age and older, who reported no history of dementia or significant neurocognitive impairments, and obtained acceptable Mini-Mental State Examination total scores [R]. The findings suggest that relatively short-term (i.e. 6 weeks) utilization of Ginkgo Biloba extract proved efficacious in enhancing certain aspects of declarative episodic memory, particularly regarding the efficiency of retrieval, and possibly the consolidation/storage of recently learned material. Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibiting Properties There is some evidence to suggest that Ginkgo Biloba extract may inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that plays a role in the breakdown of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, including Serotonin, Dopamine, and Norepinephrine. MAO inhibitors are a class of drugs used to treat depression and other mood disorders, and they work by blocking the activity of MAO, which increases the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain. In a rodent model, extracts of Ginkgo Biloba leaves produce reversible inhibition of brain MAO [R]. Both MAO-A and MAO-B types were inhibited to a similar extent. Reversible MAO inhibitors are generally considered to be safer than irreversible MAO inhibitors because they have a shorter duration of action and are less likely to cause long-lasting effects on MAO activity. Reversible MAO inhibitors work by binding to the MAO enzyme in a reversible manner, meaning that the inhibition of MAO activity is temporary and can be reversed when the drug is cleared from the body. In contrast, irreversible MAO inhibitors bind irreversibly to the MAO enzyme, meaning that they permanently inhibit MAO activity until the enzyme is regenerated, which can take several weeks. A 2009 rodent model found that acute treatment with Ginkgo Biloba extract inhibits the Norepinephrine (NET), the Serotonin (SERT), the Dopamine (DAT) uptake transporters and MAO activity [R]. Chronic treatment however, only influenced monoaminergic neurotransmission via inhibition of the Norepinephrine uptake transporter, which suggests that Ginkgo Biloba’s effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission may be mediated through increased extracellular concentrations of Norepinephrine (Noradrenaline) and Epinephrine (Adrenaline). Cholinergic And Histaminergic Interactions Ginkgo Biloba extract has been shown to inhibit Acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine in the brain [R]. By inhibiting Acetylcholinesterase, Ginkgo Biloba extract can increase the levels of Acetylcholine in the brain, which may enhance cognitive function and memory. A rodent model comparing the efficacy of several Nootropics found that Ginkgo Biloba extract attenuated Scopolamine-induced amnesia [R]. In another rodent model comparing Ginkgo Biloba extract and Donepezil (a pharmaceutical Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor), Ginkgo Biloba extract was shown to facilitate its effects via cholinergic activity and perhaps partly due to a histaminergic mechanism [R]. Histamine is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in regulating wakefulness and arousal. Histaminergic neurons are located in the Hypothalamus, and release Histamine in response to various stimuli. The most well-known histaminergic “smart drug” is probably Modafinil, which has been shown to increase Histamine release in the brain. This increase in Histamine release is believed to contribute significantly to Modafinil's wake-promoting effects. This may be one of the pathways by which Ginkgo Biloba extract works as well. BDNF And Neurogenesis In a 2009 rodent model, it was shown that rats that were given Ginko Biloba extract had an increase in hippocampal cell proliferation by 55-80%, which is associated with an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [R]. BDNF is a growth factor that supports synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, neuronal survival and neuroprotection. In addition, other rodent models have shown that Dopaminergic neurons proliferate following Ginkgo Biloba extract supplementation, leading to increased Dopamine synthesis potential [R]. L-Theanine – 150 mg L-Theanine was discovered as a constituent of green tea in 1949, and in 1950 it was isolated from gyokuro leaves. The main benefits of L-theanine are associated with promoting a relaxed state without causing drowsiness or sedation. After consumption, L-Theanine can cross the blood-brain barrier and promote an increase in alpha waves. This increase in alpha-waves may be responsible for L-Theanine’s effects on stress and anxiety reduction. Theanine is structurally similar to the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate and binds to Glutamate receptors. It acts as an antagonist at the AMPA and Kainate receptors, and acts as a partial co-agonist of the NMDA receptors (partial NMDA agonists bind to and activate the NMDA receptor, but only have partial efficacy at the receptor relative to a full agonist). Theanine also blocks the reuptake of Glutamine and Glutamate via the inhibition of Glutamine transporters and Glutamate transporters. Theanine increases Dopamine, Glycine, BDNF, and NGF levels in various areas of the brain. It may increase Serotonin levels as well, but that is less certain because of conflicting literature. Anxiety And Calmness A study conducted on 20 healthy males aged 18 to 30 years found that L-Theanine supplementation promoted the release of alpha waves, and this led to enhanced mental relaxation and concentration [R]. Another study conducted on 20 fifth-year university students during pharmacy practice found that L-Theanine supplementation had a notable effect on attenuating stress [R]. Improved Attention And Reaction Time In a study conducted on 18 healthy University student volunteers, L-Theanine had a pronounced effect on attention performance and reaction time response in subjects prone to have high anxiety [R].   Improved Memory And Attention In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted on 91 people with minor brain damage, L-Theanine improved memory, selective attention, and alertness during a memory test [R]. Improved Verbal Fluency And Executive Function In another randomized controlled trial, 30 healthy adults were given 200 mg of L-Theanine per day, or placebo. Verbal fluency and executive function scores improved after L-Theanine administration [R]. Stress levels also decreased, and sleep quality improved after L-Theanine administration. Stacking With L-Theanine L-Theanine appears to have some synergy with certain CNS stimulants. For example, the Caffeine + L-Theanine stack is one of the most basic and effective Nootropic stacks to date. Stacking L-Theanine With Caffeine For Enhanced Cognitive Function L-Theanine may have cognitive-enhancing effects, especially when taken with Caffeine. A randomized controlled trial compared the effects of 50 mg Caffeine, with and without 100 mg L-Theanine, on cognition and mood in 27 healthy volunteers [R]. The L-Theanine and Caffeine combination improved both speed and accuracy of performance of the attention-switching task at 60 min, and reduced susceptibility to distracting information in the memory task at both 60 min and 90 min. Another randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of a combination of 97 mg L-Theanine and 40 mg Caffeine as compared to placebo treatment on cognitive performance, alertness, blood pressure, and heart rate in a sample of 44 young adults [R]. The combination of moderate levels of L-Theanine and Caffeine significantly improved accuracy during task switching and self-reported alertness, and reduced self-reported tiredness. A 2019 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial found that stacking L-Theanine, Caffeine and L-Tyrosine may improve mental and physical performance in athletes and could hold ergogenic value for athletes in sports requiring rapid and accurate movements [R]. Stacking To Smooth Out The Caffeine Jitters L-Theanine has been shown to suppress the blood pressure increasing effects of caffeine, and may also counteract blood pressure increases under stressful conditions [R, R]. Although the mechanisms behind the synergistic effect of L-Theanine and Caffeine on cognition are not completely understood, L-Theanine's relaxation-promoting properties are likely responsible for the reduced anxiousness and jitters associated with Caffeine use. Stacking For Enhancement Of Sleep Quality After Caffeine Use One notable rodent model found that L-Theanine could partially counteract Caffeine-induced sleep disturbances [R]. Sleep A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted on boys previously diagnosed with ADHD found that L-Theanine use resulted in significantly higher sleep percentage and sleep efficiency scores, along with a non-significant trend for less activity during sleep compared to those in the placebo group [R]. A 2019 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial assessed the effects of L-Theanine on 46 participants with a DSM-5 diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) [R]. For context, a DSM-5 diagnosis of GAD has a pre-requisite of several very troubling traits [R]. Just one of the many criteria is “excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance)”. The 2019 trial found that L-Theanine may improve sleep satisfaction, as well as symptoms of sleep disturbance. Saffron Extract (Crocus Sativus) (flower) – 30 mg Saffron extract is derived from the dried stigmas of the Crocus sativus plant, and it has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties. It has gained scientific attention recently for its potential anti-depressant effects. Several studies have shown that Saffron extract has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-depressant effects, and it may also have anti-cancer and neuroprotective properties. Saffron extract has shown to increase the levels of Serotonin, Norepinephrine, and Dopamine in the brain, as well as preserve dopaminergic neurons. Antidepressant, Anxiety And Antianhedonic Effects Saffron extract has a clear track record of notable antidepressant effects, consistently outperforming placebo, and performing comparably with the effects of pharmaceutical SSRI’s. In a double-blind controlled clinical trial, 66 patients with major depressive disorder accompanied by anxious distress were randomly assigned to receive either Saffron or Citalopram (an SSRI) for 6 weeks [R]. The study found that both Saffron and Citalopram showed significant improvement in depression and anxiety scores, with no significant difference between the two.   In a 2014 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, 40 patients with a diagnosis of mild to moderate depression were randomly chosen to receive either Fluoxetine (40 mg/day) or Saffron extract (30 mg/day) for 6 weeks [R]. Saffron extract showed the same antidepressant efficacy compared with Fluoxetine in patients who were suffering from depression. These results can be seen consistently across the board when comparing Saffron extract with pharmaceutical SSRI’s.Saffron extract has also been shown to ameliorate anhedonia, which suggests a more potent action in the regulation of Dopamine than Serotonin or other monoamines [R]. Anhedonia refers to the reduced ability to experience pleasure and is associated with low levels of Dopamine. Anxiety and depression appear to be associated with the decreased activity of both Serotonin and Dopamine [R]. It is worth highlighting that the antianhedonic effects of antidepressants differ depending on the compound’s mechanism of action [R]. For example, Saffron extract, despite consistently achieving similar metrics to SSRI’s, achieves cognitive changes via different (and potentially superior depending on an individual’s brain chemistry) mechanisms. Randomized controlled trials have actually been conducted using Saffron extract as a treatment for SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction [R]. This strongly suggests that the way Saffron extract produces anti-depressant effects as potent as pharmaceutical reuptake inhibitors extends past its Serotonergic effects. Dopaminergic Activity Saffron extract appears to interact with both MAO-A and MAO-B in the brain. A systematic review found that the administration of Saffron extract and its constituents increases Glutamate and Dopamine levels in the brain in a dose-dependent manner [R]. A recent 2021 randomized controlled trial conducted on young men found that the addition of a Saffron supplement to resistance training resulted in greater improvements in happiness levels than resistance training alone [R]. AEA (an endogenous ligand for the CB1 cannabinoid receptor), 2-AG (the primary endogenous ligand for the CB2 cannabinoid receptor), Dopamine, and β-endorphin concentrations significantly increased in the resistance training + Saffron group, while no changes were detected in the resistance training only group. Serotonin concentrations and happiness levels significantly increased in both groups with greater changes in the resistance training + Saffron group. In addition, both groups experienced significantly increased muscular endurance, with greater changes in the resistance training + Saffron group. A 2018 randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of Saffron on reducing depression among 57 recovered consumers of Methamphetamine living with HIV/AIDS [R]. Saffron was determined to be an effective supplement through its ability to improve depression in these individuals, likely by increasing Dopamine and Serotonin secretion in the brain. These results are just scratching the surface of the positive literature available on Saffron’s cognitive effects. Huperzine A – 400 mcg Huperzine A is a natural compound found in the plant Huperzia serrata, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Cholinergic Activity Huperzine A is a potent and selective inhibitor of Acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine in the brain. By inhibiting Acetylcholinesterase, Huperzine A increases the levels of Acetylcholine in the brain, leading to enhanced cholinergic neurotransmission. This increased cholinergic activity has been shown to improve cognitive function, memory, and learning. In addition to its Acetylcholinesterase inhibiting activity, Huperzine A also has neuroprotective effects. It has been shown to protect neurons from oxidative stress and to promote the growth and survival of neurons. Acetylcholine is not only a major regulator of cognitive performance, but it is also an important neurotransmitter needed for optimal muscular contractions during exercise. A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials assessed the effects of Huperzine A on patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia [R]. 8 trials with 733 participants showed that Huperzine A significantly improved cognitive function measured by memory quotient in patients with Alzheimer's disease. A 4 week clinical trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of 100 mcg of Huperzine A dosed twice per day on memory and learning performance in 34 pairs of junior middle school students complaining of memory inadequacy [R]. At the end of the trial, the Huperzine A group's memory quotient was more than that of the placebo group, and Chinese language lesson scores in the Huperzine A group were elevated as well, suggesting enhanced memory and learning performance in Huperzine A treated adolescent students. Dopaminergic Activity Despite primarily acting as a cholinergic, some evidence suggests that Huperzine A may also influence the levels of other neurotransmitters, including Dopamine. A rodent model found that Huperzine A significantly increased the levels of Dopamine and Norepinephrine throughout the prefrontal cortex [R]. Another rodent model found that Huperzine A had similar potency on increasing Dopamine levels to the pharmaceutical Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Donepezil [R]. Huperzine A And Cocaine Clinical Trial Changes in the Dopamine system due to drugs of abuse have been extensively studied. However, cholinergic transmission is also altered by drugs of abuse and contributes to psychostimulant reinforcement. For example, Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors block Cocaine self-administration in monkeys. This finding, among others in animal models, have led researchers to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Huperzine A as a treatment for Cocaine use disorder. In a 2015 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, participants were randomly chosen to receive Huperzine A or placebo [R]. Participants received randomized infusions of Cocaine (0 and 40mg, IV) on days 1 and 9. On day 10, participants received noncontingent, randomized infusions of Cocaine (0 and 20mg, IV) before being given 5 opportunities, at 15-minute intervals, to purchase additional infusions or to keep $5 for each choice opportunity. Time-course and peak effects analyses show that treatment with 400 mcg of Huperzine A significantly attenuated Cocaine-induced increases of “Bad Effects” and “Willing to Pay,” (ie, “How much are you willing to pay for the Cocaine infusion you just received-in dollars?). Remembering Names And Information How many times have you met someone, introduced yourself, and within a handful of minutes forgotten what their name is? Or, read something and then minutes later forgot it. This is the pitfall of the transition between working memory and long-term memory. Working memory functions like a very leaky thermos. It doesn’t hold much, and information spills out all the time. This is a very relevant example of where the synergy of the cholinergics and other Nootropics in this formula could be advantageous from a memory enhancement standpoint. The one-two punch with enhanced working memory and long-term memory formation may even be supportive in areas of life that extend beyond the enhancement of productivity, attention, or concentration on a particular task. How Much Choline Do You Need Per Day? The Adequate Intake (AI), as established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Institute of Medicine, for adults is 550 mg per day for men and 425 mg per day for women. We all know how brutally low some of the AI's have proved to be in the past couple decades, and there is evidence suggesting that the AI for Choline is also far too low. One study showed that 2200 mg per day of Choline protected against the DNA damage that otherwise occurred in people consuming only 550 mg [R]. There are not enough studies on Choline, and it is a severely lacking area of research considering how important it is for brain health. I would shoot for at least 900-1200 mg of Choline per day. A big chunk of that can be achieved through regular liver and egg yolk consumption, but supplementation can also help you hit that number with much greater ease.  I eat 1 ounce of beef liver per day, include eggs in my diet, and supplement with Alpha-GPC often. I also take extra precautions to support methylation, which I will delve into next in the methylation subsection. How Choline Affects Methylation And Health Status The MTHFR gene codes for an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, or MTHFR. This enzyme is necessary for the production of DNA and to support methylation pathways that are essential for all bodily functions. Genetic variations in this gene result in reduced activity of the enzyme and have been associated with cardiovascular disease, neurological defects, some forms of cancer, and a myriad of other diseases and disorders [R, R]. Personally, I am homozygous for C677T of MTHFR, which results in an 80-90% decrease in my efficiency in processing folic acid.  The direct reflection of that in blood biomarkers can be high homocysteine and low B12 and folate levels. I determined this via a simple 23andMe genetics test.  Normally your body creates methyl groups by recycling homocysteine to methionine, as well as by converting Choline to Betaine.  When nutrient intake needs are sufficiently met, the body depends on these two mechanisms equally. However, if you are deprived of methyl groups or have poor MTHFR activity because of a polymorphism, you may create a disproportional ratio of dependency on the Choline to Betaine pathway. If you can't create enough Methylfolate, your body will ramp up the use of Betaine and Choline for methyl groups. By ramping up Choline to Betaine conversion to support methylation, your body can become depleted of the Choline it needs to create Acetylcholine. Downstream, the depletion of Choline can eventually lead to impaired cognitive function, DNA damage, and can be deleterious to overall health. The prevalence of MTHFR polymorphisms and micronutrient deficient diets is very common nowadays, and many people would benefit from changing their diet and/or using some form of Choline supplementation to maintain higher levels of Choline. I take Alpha-GPC frequently, on top of the daily Betaine and Creatine I take to support methylation, improve my health, and optimize my performance. Ingredients I Didn’t Include In The Formula And Why Theobromine Theobromine competes with Caffeine for Adenosine receptor antagonism. Theobromine is also weaker than Caffeine in both its inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and its antagonism of Adenosine receptors [R, R]. In addition, it has a dragged out peak time of 2-3 hours as a consequence of its lack of water solubility, whereas Caffeine peaks in only 30 minutes [R]. It also has a long half-life of 6-8 hours, whereas Caffeine is only 5 hours [R]. The ideal Adenosine receptor antagonist would work potently, quickly, and feature a pharmacokinetic profile that supports maximal clearance (or as close to it as possible) by the end of your day and allows Adenosine to do its job when you are trying to fall asleep. Overall, my current perspective on Theobromine is that it is a counterintuitive ingredient to include in this formula as it could inhibit the Caffeine from working as well via Adenosine receptor competition and its inferior pharmacodynamic profile, and it could also make it more difficult to get high quality sleep because of its inferior pharmacokinetic profile. Taurine Taurine is one of the most common ingredients in energy drinks and gaming supplements. It’s almost as if it’s just an expectation of companies to include this ingredient at this point, regardless of if it actually provides any cognitive enhancement or not. While Taurine is a useful antioxidant and has some literature supporting its utility for enhancing endurance exercise performance, Taurine acts as an agonist at the Glycine and GABA receptors and is a nervous system depressant. Expectedly, its inclusion in energy enhancing formulas like energy drinks and pre-workouts has led to some confusion among scholars and researchers who see Taurine as a sedative, rather than a stimulant [R]. I speculate that its inclusion in energy drinks is mainly to make loose sports performance enhancing claims, or to dull the stimulating effects of Caffeine, so users will be able to drink more. While the inclusion of L-Theanine in an energy enhancing formula could be seen as a similarly paradoxical adjunct ingredient, it is not sedating, and there is enough data specifically supporting its efficacy as a cognitive enhancing Nootropic in combination with Caffeine that I felt it was worthwhile to include at a mild dose. Our Dream/sleep enhancing formula purposefully features a higher dose of L-Theanine. I wanted Respawn to be a product that not only improves several vectors of cognitive performance, but also acts as a CNS stimulant complex in a unique way. I wanted it to be different from all of the stimulant-based products we’ve already released, and be undoubtedly distinct from everything else on the market, and I felt that Taurine was a counterproductive ingredient to accomplishing that. Glucuronolactone Glucuronolactone is a compound commonly found in energy drink formulations like Red Bull, and in Gaming formulas like G Fuel, with surprisingly minimal research on it, given its widespread usage. It appears that each Red Bull energy drink, depending on the location in the world it is sold or the formula variant, contains as low as 60 mg of Glucuronolactone, or upwards of as high as 600 mg of Glucuronolactone. Based on extrapolating out G Fuel’s “energy complex” we know that they likely use around 100 mg or less of Glucuronolactone.  Any literature available supporting its efficacy as a Nootropic is conflated with the supporting ingredients in the energy drink being evaluated. Basically, in every study that has shown benefit, the observed benefits cannot be attributed to Glucuronolactone alone as it is featured in a blend of ingredients in a Red Bull or a pre-workout formulation. Personally, I’m skeptical it does anything, and I suspect it’s likely a cheap and exotic sounding compound featured in certain formulas to differentiate the label in some unique way. AstraGin® I am familiar with Astragalus, as I have been interested in it for its effects on kidney health, and potential impact on Telomere length for a while. However, its utility in enhancing the bioavailability of select amino acids in conjunction with Panax Notoginseng at such a small dose has always perplexed me. It is often featured in products at only 25-50 mg, despite the efficacious dose of Astragalus Root Extract for basically any application (especially boosting eGFR levels) being in the grams range. I’ve personally seen Astragalus Root Extract clearly improve biomarkers, but it required thousands of milligrams per day to achieve those changes. Even if it did enhance the uptake of an otherwise already bioavailable ingredient, would it not be more reliable to just use a maxed out, proven efficacious dose of that amino acid? To me this seems like a more reliable strategy, rather than using a lower, submaximal dose, and then adding a bioavailability enhancer on top of it in hopes that it would enhance its effects to a level that you could otherwise just guarantee by using the efficacious dose. I can see the potential utility when space is a concern. For example, in a capsule product designed to enhance Nitric Oxide where only so much can fit in the capsules. However, even then I’m skeptical of this ingredient, and is why I asked the late Dr. Hector Lopez for his opinion on it. If you don’t know of Dr. Hector Lopez, he was a prolific researcher and formulator who I had a lot of respect for. He brought an immense amount of value to this industry. Overall, his opinion was that the literature supporting AstraGin was dependent on loose mechanistic hypothetical claims from preclinical animal and in vitro data, using doses magnitudes higher than those used in humans in dietary supplements to yield any enhanced amino acid uptake metrics, and it is likely not worth using. If you can see in vitro that a pathway is upregulated after the administration of an ingredient, and that same mechanistic pathway is involved in amino acid uptake, concluding that the ingredient is then definitively going to significantly increase amino acid uptake in humans is a stretch. He went into a lot more detail, and it was enough to convince me that it would likely be more reliable to just dose bioavailable ingredients where I’d want to see them as a consumer than to rely on very speculative amino acid uptake enhancing adjunct ingredients. He did add a caveat that AstraGin is being studied in humans right now in China using a 50 mg dose to evaluate its effect on L-Arginine absorption and Nitric Oxide production, so it should be interesting to see what the outcome of that is, and perhaps we will revisit this ingredient in the future, and it may look more promising. Lion’s Mane And Other Mushroom Extracts Lion’s Mane and other mushroom extracts like Cordyceps, Reishi and Maitake hold a lot of promise. However, the way they facilitate their effects is something that I feel shouldn’t be a forced mandatory adjunct with Respawn, rather they should be utilized when warranted based on individual brain chemistry. Potent doses of mushroom extracts are not necessarily going to be universally advantageous for all individuals alongside what is meant to be a stimulating and dopaminergic monster of a formula. Certain mushroom extracts have been used for thousands of years, not only for their cognitive-enhancing properties, but also for their potential neuroprotective attributes, and they have very potent effects. With that said, in my opinion they are best kept siloed in a separate formula so you can choose to manipulate your dosages of dopaminergics and cholinergics separately from your mushroom extracts, and tailor your Nootopic stack to your own individual brain chemistry. This is why we have our mega-dosed ‘Shroom' formula as a separate product entirely. Bacopa Monnieri This is a Nootropic I really like and appears to have strong literature behind it. We have it in our Gorilla Mind nootropic formula. Its main benefits include its enhancement of verbal recall, information retention, and memory consolidation. The taste of this ingredient is horrible though, making it a potentially flavor destroying ingredient. Respawn already has several ingredients with memory enhancing properties, and the formula is designed mainly for energy, intense focus, accuracy, reduction of errors, and acute cognitive performance enhancement. While Bacopa Monnieri is a great ingredient, I see it as a Nootropic more useful for studying, preparing for speeches and business presentations, memorizing songs and scripts, or any activity that could benefit from enhanced memory consolidation. The risk of ruining the taste of Respawn with Bacopa Monnieri was too high given that it is intended to be something people will want to sip on while gaming or working. Noopept, Bromantane, Racetams, Other Synthetic Nootropics And Prodrugs Although they are effective Nootropics, Noopept, Bromantane, Racetams (class of drugs all named with the suffix “racetam”), prodrugs like Adrafinil, and other synthetic compounds that cannot be found in nature or the food supply are not DSHEA compliant and cannot be legally sold as dietary supplements, so we did not include any. If this weren't the case, I may have fit Noopept or Bromantane into the formula. Should You Ever Cycle Off Of Gorilla Mind Respawn? It may be prudent to cycle off for at least a week per month, although the ingredients in the formula have all been well tolerated for months without breaks in clinical trials. This will largely depend on your sensitivity to stimulants and cholinergics. For example, there is only so much cholinergic neurotransmission a person can handle, and if you start experiencing fatigue or brain fog, it would be worthwhile to either lower your dose, use the product more selectively/infrequently (e.g. only on your most cognitively demanding of days), or cycle off for a week or so. How To Stack Gorilla Mind Respawn With Other Gorilla Mind Products Respawn is a turnkey formula and you don’t need to add anything to it. However, there are certain circumstances in which stacking could be worthwhile. Stacking Respawn With Gorilla Mind Smooth If the max dose of Respawn (which contains 300 mg of Caffeine and a high dose of dopaminergics) is too stimulating for you, you could take ½ – 1 scoop with 1-3 capsules of Gorilla Mind Smooth to get a high dose of cholinergics without the max stimulant effects of Respawn. Stacking Respawn With Shroom Our mushroom extract formula Shroom has unique effects that may be complementary to Respawn, depending on your brain chemistry. It is the most aggressively dosed mushroom extract formula on the market, and as far as I know is the first to feature the maximum 3.2 gram dose of Lion’s Mane shown to be effective in clinical studies [R]. In general, Shroom is supportive of mental clarity, creativity, information retention, and can be energy boosting in some individuals as well. With that said, not everyone responds the same, and you should assess your response to each formula separately before combining them to determine if both are complementary to your brain chemistry on their own. If you plan on stacking them, I advise dialing in your ideal Respawn dose before stacking Shroom on top, and then introducing Shroom at an introductory tolerance assessment dose of 1-3 capsules before tapering up over multiple uses to the maximum dose. Stacking Respawn With Gorilla Mode Nitric To date, our most potent pre-workout stack has been the combination of Gorilla Mode Nitric with Gorilla Mode Energy. Adjunct Glycerol for additional hyper-hydration and Gorilla Mind Smooth for enhanced force production are great to stack on top too, but the biggest needle mover is the Nitric + Energy stack for maxed out energy, pump, and performance. However, now that we have Respawn, I do believe that some who previously used the Nitric + Energy stack might prefer Nitric + Respawn. Which you prefer will depend on your stimulant tolerance, goals, and brain chemistry. I felt it would be worthwhile to give a summary below of each of our current Nootropic and Energy focused formulas, and which cases they each excel in. Respawn vs Energy vs Smooth vs Shroom: What's the Difference? ? RESPAWN – Our gaming/cognitive enhancing formula designed for amplified focus, clean energy, elevated mental clarity, and enhanced reaction time. It contains a potent blend of ingredients that push the dopaminergic, cholinergic, and cerebral vasodilatory pathways to provide a clear amplification of cognitive performance. Respawn features ingredients studied specifically for aim, coordination, stress resilience and drive, as opposed to ‘Energy' which is tailored towards pure energy and anti-fatigue. Best used for: Gaming, deep work, and/or cognitively demanding tasks. ⚡️ ENERGY – Our turnkey energy formula is tailored towards aggressive energy, productivity, and anti-fatigue. It contains a high dose of carefully chosen synergistic stimulants and nootropics. Energy contains distinctive components that set it apart from our other formulas and deliver huge amounts of energy, making it an excellent supplement to combine with Gorilla Mode Nitric or Smooth. Best used for: Heavy lifting sessions or physical work. ? SMOOTH – Our stimulant-free Nootropic formula designed to support cognitive function, information retention, efficiency, and concentration. It can also be used as a stack alongside our pre-workouts to boost strength through the acute effects of Acetylcholine mediated force production. Best used for: Stimulant-free cognitive support and can double as a Caffeine-free/stimulant-free pre-workout. ? SHROOM – Our mega-dosed mushroom extract formula designed to support creativity, memory formation and consolidation, mood elevation, and neurogenesis. Shroom can be a potent adjunct to Respawn, Energy, or Smooth via its unique ingredients and the different mechanisms of action of the Mushrooms in the formula. Best used for: Creative work and cognitive support. Limited Edition Respawn Shaker To commemorate the release of Gorilla Mind Respawn, we have also released a limited edition Respawn shaker cup in collaboration with ShakeSphere.               View this post on Instagram                        A post shared by Gorilla Mind (@gorillamind)   \n\n It is still available on the site, and is available as a bundle with Respawn at a discount.  Conclusion – What To Expect From Gorilla Mind Respawn This is the most potent and comprehensive gaming and eSports formula on the market. You can expect amplified focus, clean energy, elevated mental clarity, enhanced reaction time, and a significant increase in drive and stress resilience. I put a lot of time into it this and am very happy with how it turned out. As mentioned earlier in the article, despite being branded as a gaming formula, Respawn doubles as a potent Nootropic and energy stack for any mentally demanding tasks, and is perfect for intense work sessions and boosting productivity. The gaming industry is seemingly years behind the fitness industry when it comes to education around supplementation, and companies capitalize on this by selling glorified pixie dust Caffeine drinks to those who don’t know better. We are going to change that with Respawn. Try Gorilla Mind Respawn for yourself here and let me know what you think.

    "content": "Gorilla Mode Energy Formula Review | Comprehensive Supplement Breakdown     Gorilla Mode Stim is our aggressively dosed turnkey energy formula designed for maxed out performance and intense focus. It is branded as a pre-workout, but it more broadly serves as an all around high potency energy formula. You can expect a very clean boost in mental clarity, productivity, focus and energy with this product. Gorilla Mode Stim contains a massive dose of carefully chosen synergistic stimulants and nootropics. This product is designed specifically for energy and mental sharpness, so it does not contain any Nitric Oxide precursors, plasma expanders, or volumizing agents like Gorilla Mode and Gorilla Mode Nitric do. As it is a pure energy formula, it can be stacked alongside our stimulant-free pre-workout Gorilla Mode Nitric to create an extremely potent all around pre-workout. Just like all of our other products, look at the label and compare it to your current pre-workout. The dosages speak for themselves, and the synergy of our formulas are unmatched.

Gorilla Mode And Gorilla Mind Rush This product is essentially the cognitive enhancing component of Gorilla Mode cranked up to the max. The tub is less than half the size of a normal Gorilla Mode tub, and the scoop is tiny in comparison. This product is pure cognitive enhancement, and nothing else. This is for the stim junkies, or for those who just want a cost-effective pre-workout/energy formula that is designed just for the mental component without any of the N.O. precursors, or hyper-hydrating and volumizing agents. I doubled the L-Tyrosine and Kanna dosages in this product, and the N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate and Caffeine dosages are higher as well. As far as how Gorilla Mode Stim stack up to Gorilla Mind Rush, they are both great in their own way. Gorilla Mind Rush is designed for laser-focused productivity, whereas Gorilla Mode Stim is more of a smooth, euphoric/mood elevating energy boost that also seems to enhance creativity. Even for the most abusive of stim junkies, Gorilla Mind Rush is typically going to be enough for them to still get a strong effect. Gorilla Mode Stim is a bit of a smoother formula that is designed mainly to boost energy and mood, but not be overwhelmingly stimulating. They're both very clean energy boosters, but Rush is the “get sh*t done in a pill” product, whereas Gorilla Mode Stim is a pure energy formula that you can sip on. Gorilla Mode Stim Vs. Other Energy Formulas On The Market For those who prefer sipping on something instead of popping a pill while studying, while gaming, while writing, while editing, while doing whatever, Gorilla Mode Stim is a top of class energy boosting formula designed to get a much stronger mental edge over your standard energy drinks and powders. When I think of product categories I can compare it to, G Fuel is the first thing that comes to mind. Those products are essentially just underdosed caffeine and antioxidant blends, and this is where I believe Gorilla Mode Stim can truly be a mainstream industry disruptor. Flavor And Mixability Gorilla Mode Stim mixes well and the flavor systems we developed for it are great. The high dose of Kanna is difficult to mask, but we did an even better job covering it up than I expected. You don't have worry about graininess like you do with Gorilla Mode or Gorilla Mode Nitric because there's no pump/performance ingredients in this product. A full dose of Gorilla Mode Stim is a very small amount of powder. The high dose of Kanna can leave some residue (almost like pulp), but that's just what comes with the territory with a dose this high. How To Dose Gorilla Mode Stim Mix 1-2 scoops of Gorilla Mode Stim in 10-12 ounces of water and consume 30 minutes prior to training. Vary the amount of water to achieve your desired flavor level. First time users should begin use with 1/2-1 scoop or less to evaluate tolerance. DO NOT EXCEED 2 SCOOPS IN ANY 24 HOUR PERIOD. Just like with other stimulant based products, if you want to really feel the stimulants hit hard, the less food in your stomach the better. The difference between using stimulants on an empty stomach vs. a full stomach is night and day. You will still get the mental benefits from the ingredients in the formula if you take Gorilla Mode Stim on a full stomach, but you will almost undoubtedly feel less cognitive enhancement the more food is in your stomach. That’s just how stimulants work and applies to any stimulant based product, not just Gorilla Mode Stim. Gorilla Mode Stim Ingredients Breakdown L-Tyrosine – 3000 mg L-Tyrosine is an amazing cognitive enhancing amino acid that acts by balancing neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Its primary role is as the direct precursor to thyroxine and to the neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. L-Tyrosine shines in its ability to improve mental sharpness, focus, energy levels, and cause mood elevation [R, R]. Gorilla Mode Stim has 3000 mg of L-Tyrosine per full dose, which is twice as much as classic Gorilla Mode. L-Tyrosine Vs N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine L-Tyrosine is the most bioavailable form of Tyrosine. In short, N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is very inefficiently converted by the body to Tyrosine [R]. Even IV’ing N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine can’t elevate plasma Tyrosine levels to a significant degree, let alone via oral ingestion. Claims of increased water solubility and bioavailability are all marketing hype and were disproved easily by showing just how poorly N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is at converting to Tyrosine in the body.  Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum) – 1000 mg 1000 milligrams is a very high dose of Kanna. I've had a fair bit of experience with it at this point through Gorilla Mode and Gorilla Mind Smooth. Those formulas each have 500 mg of Kanna in them per full dose. We've had classic Gorilla Mode on the market for about 10 months now and the feedback has been great, so we decided we'd push the boundaries even further on this product. More isn't always better, and Kanna's effects can start to take a bit of a negative turn once you go above the 1 gram mark per day. To date, this is the max effective dose of Kanna I would personally take at one time. Kanna supplementation has been found to effectively lower stress, elevate mood and increase focus. Personally, I notice a huge boost in my mood and I lock in a little bit more on whatever I am trying to concentrate on when I supplement with Kanna. Kanna was a huge success in our pre-workout formula because it also complements stimulants very well, which you have probably found out first hand if you have tried Gorilla Mode. Kanna works mainly via increasing the amount of serotonin available in the brain, and is typically utilized for its anti-anxiety and mood elevating effects [R]. This is an ingredient you will really feel, and can be especially useful for a compounding level of mood elevation and mental clarity that isn’t simply stimulant based. Kanna has no addictive properties, and it is not hallucinogenic [R, R]. One thing to keep in mind with Kanna use is that it has a high affinity for the serotonin transporter. Therefore, it is plausible that Kanna can interfere with SSRI pharmaceuticals. Caffeine Anhydrous – 375 mg Caffeine is the most well-known central nervous system stimulant on earth. Aside from the obvious cognitive benefits of Caffeine, it also has shown to increase power output and training volume, as well as lower fatigue. Classic Gorilla Mode has 350 mg of caffeine per full dose, whereas Gorilla Mode Stim has 375 mg. How Much Can Caffeine Increase Workload, Even When Sleep Deprived? In a double-blind, crossover study, 16 professional rugby players ingested either a placebo or 4 mg/kg caffeine 1 hr before exercise [R]. The effects of caffeine were assessed on well slept (8 hours or more) and sleep-deprived athletes (6 hours or less). Athletes were asked to perform as many repetitions on each set as possible without failure. Sleep deprivation produced a very large decrease in total load in the placebo group, but caffeine ingestion in the sleep deprived group was able to completely offset that loss of performance. Caffeine also resulted in a moderate increase in total load in the well slept group. Notably, Testosterone response to exercise increased with caffeine compared with placebo. Caffeine Increases Energy Expenditure (Calories Burned) Per Day Single-dose oral administration of 100 mg caffeine increased the resting metabolic rate of both lean and post-obese human volunteers by 3-4% over 150 minutes [R]. Repeated caffeine administration of 100 mg every 2 hours over a 12 hour span increased energy expenditure of both subject groups by 8-11%. The net effect was a significant increase in daily energy expenditure of 150 calories in lean volunteers and 79 calories in post-obese subjects. Commonly consumed doses of caffeine can have a significant impact on energy balance and staying lean. Stacking Caffeine With L-Theanine To Help You Get To Sleep And Smooth Out The Jitters If you get jitters even with low doses of caffeine, L-Theanine is definitely worth looking into. L-Theanine works by targeting four key neurotransmitters: GABA, Serotonin, Dopamine, and Norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters are responsible for feelings of attention, stress, arousal, and pleasure. By mitigating the over-activity of neurons, L-Theanine helps to calm down the brain, reduce stress, and get rid of anxiety. This is why L-Theanine complements stimulants like caffeine so well, as it takes the edge off of stimulants that can cause jitters and over-stimulation in some individuals. One notable rodent model even showed that L-theanine can partially counteract caffeine-induced sleep disturbances [R]. L-Theanine can also significantly improve memory, focus and attention to detail [R]. Stacking Gorilla Mind Smooth with Gorilla Mode Stim will provide you with an adequate dose of L-Theanine that will take the edge off of the stims in the pre-workout if you are very stimulant sensitive. However, because Gorilla Mind Smooth and Gorilla Mode Stim both contain Kanna and Huperzine A, I wouldn't suggest combining the two at their max dosages if you do combine them. Caffeine Dosage In general, healthy adults can safely consume up to 400 mg of caffeine per day [R]. However, that doesn’t mean that you should use that high of a dosage. Use caffeine as needed relative to your individual tolerance. For some, starting with as low as half a scoop of Gorilla Mode Stim (93.75 mg caffeine) may be more than enough to achieve topped out cognitive stimulation without getting jitters and other caffeine induced side effects. For those with a much higher caffeine tolerance, the maximum daily dose of Gorilla Mode Stim includes 375 mg of caffeine. If that isn’t enough caffeine for you to feel it, you probably need to cycle off of stimulants for at least a week or two. N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate – 375 mg Phenylethylamine (PEA) is popularly known as the “love drug” in the brain. PEA increases the release of serotonin, adrenaline, dopamine, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). These neurotransmitters can significantly impact cognitive function, state of well-being, energy levels and overall mood [R, R]. PEA is called the love drug because it promotes the same feelings of infatuation experienced during the early phases of love. Exhilarating things like skydiving, using certain psychoactive drugs, and eating large amounts of chocolate also raise PEA levels. Orally ingested PEA only has a half-life of 5-10 minutes, which is why it is nearly useless in most supplements. This is because Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) quickly breaks it down. MAO is an enzyme in the body that breaks down PEA, dopamine, as well as other neurotransmitters. This is why effective PEA based products almost always feature some sort of MAO inhibitor. By using MAO inhibitors like Hordenine with PEA, you can effectively prevent MAO from breaking down PEA as quickly, consequently allowing PEA to exert its full effects in the body and significantly increasing its active life. I wanted to go in another direction with this formula and include a compound that is harder hitting, as the effects of the PEA and Hordenine combo are a bit subtle. This is why I decided to include a very high dose of N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate in Gorilla Mode Stim. N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate mimics the actions of adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin and keeps levels elevated throughout the duration of a full workout. The reason it lasts longer than PEA is that it has 2 methyl groups connected to the Nitrogen in the molecule, which acts as a safeguard to prevent it from being broken down by MAO as quickly as PEA, and doesn’t require a MAO inhibitor to be stacked with it to last throughout a workout. This is the chemical structure of Phenylethylamine (PEA).  The nitrogen atom in PEA is known as the amine, and needs to be protected from MAO in order to prolong its effects in the brain. As you can see, there is nothing attached to the Nitrogen atom to protect it from being cleaved by the MAO enzyme. This is the chemical structure of N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate.  The 2 methyl groups attached to the Nitrogen atom prevent MAO from cleaving the amine as quickly, consequently increasing the duration of its cognitive enhancing effects for the majority of your workout. Classic Gorilla Mode has 350 mg of N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate per full dose, whereas Gorilla Mode Stim has 375 mg. In conjunction with the 375 mg dose of caffeine, the high dose of N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate in this formula can significantly increase focus, intensity, energy levels, and overall performance. BioPerine® (Black Pepper Fruit Extract) (standardized to 95% Piperine) – 10 mg Bioperine is a trademarked form of black pepper extract standardized to 95% Piperine. Black pepper extract is a very effective CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor [R]. These enzymes break down molecules like caffeine and noradrenaline in the body. By prolonging the breakdown of the cognitive enhancing ingredients in this formula, Bioperine extends how long they work for, and can also significantly increase their bioavailability. Basically, Bioperine makes the stimulants hit harder and last longer. In addition, Bioperine has MAO inhibiting properties, thus further potentiating the effects of N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate. Huperzine A – 400 mcg Huperzine A works by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase in the brain, which is an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is not only a major regulator of cognitive performance, but it is also an important neurotransmitter needed for optimal muscular contractions during exercise. Huperzine A has shown to promote neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons in the brain) and act as a neuroprotective agent for existing neurons in the brain. In turn, Huperzine A has shown to enhance memory, focus and overall cognitive function [R, R]. Huperzine A is one of the most potent Nootropics that you can really “feel” and it complements the other stimulants and Nootropics in this formula perfectly. Should You Ever Cycle Off Of Gorilla Mode Stim? I advise you cycle off of everything you're using for at least 5 to 7 days per month, regardless if you're on Gorilla Mode, Nitric, Stim, Gorilla Mind Rush, or Gorilla Mind Smooth. Even Gorilla Mode Nitric and Gorilla Mind Smooth that have no stimulants, I would still advise everyone cycle off of whatever they're using for at least 5 to 7 days each month. How To Combine Gorilla Mode Stim With Other Gorilla Mind Products How would you combine Gorilla Mode Stim with Gorilla Mode? You wouldn't. Because they have the exact same stimulant complex inside of them, so you wouldn't combine the two or else you'd be OD'ing on stimulants. If you want to combine Gorilla Mode Stim with Gorilla Mode Nitric though, you could definitely do that. You could use up to two scoops of each still if you really wanted to because Gorilla Mode Nitric has no stimulants in it. You can combine Gorilla Mode Stim with Gorilla Mind Smooth too, but I wouldn't advise using the full dose of each as you might push yourself into side effect territory with the huge amount of Kanna that overlaps between the two formulas. I advise against combining Gorilla Mind Rush with Gorilla Mode Stim as they both have their own very potent combination of stimulants. Conclusion – What To Expect From Gorilla Mode Stim? If you haven't fried your adrenals with chronic stimulant abuse, you can expect a significant amount of energy, focus, mental clarity, as well as a bit of an increase in creativity and mood elevation. This is an energy formula and that is how it will be branded moving forward as opposed to solely as a pre-workout. With that being said, it is a great pre-workout too if you don't want all the pump and performance ingredients that come from Gorilla Mode or Gorilla Mode Nitric. If you just want the straight mental component maxed out from Gorilla Mode, that's what you're getting with Gorilla Mode Stim, and it's at a more cost-effective price point. The effects are spot on, as you would expect, because this is basically just a stronger version of Mode. I think you guys are going like it.

    "content": "Does Boldenone (Equipoise) Aromatize Into Estradiol Or Act As An Aromatase Inhibitor? | The Truth     Boldenone (Equipoise) is believed by many to aromatize into Estradiol at 50% the rate of Testosterone based on a snippet from the book “Anabolics” written by William Llewellyn. The viability of Boldenone as a useful anabolic is something that has been heavily debated for years in the bodybuilding industry. How potent is Boldenone at building muscle? If you are prone to estrogenic side-effects from Testosterone, can it be swapped in as a Testosterone base? Over the past year I have been compiling more and more evidence that leads me to believe that Boldenone cannot replace Testosterone as a base, and I've seen several blood test results come back showing that it actually crushes Estradiol levels. For example, if someone wanted to use 500 mg of Testosterone, but they couldn't use that high of a dose and avoid estrogenic side effects without concurrent use of Aromasin or Arimidex, a conclusion many have come to is that you could then just use EQ instead at the same dose to cut the estrogenic activity in half, but still support adequate Estradiol production. But when you dig into it, is that actually the case? “Nandrolone aromatizes at 20% the rate of Testosterone” is another assumption similar to this that was passed down the grapevine in our community for years, which we now know is not true. So, why would the same not apply to Boldenone?

Testosterone bases are anabolic androgenic steroids that are substrates for aromatase and convert to enough Estrogen to support adequate Estrogen receptor activation. Mistakenly, Boldenone has been placed in this category, even by me. Adequate Estrogen production facilitates neuroprotection, cardioprotection, the GH/IGF-1 axis, downstream growth factor production, and a myriad of other important functions for both health and performance. It is commonly stated that Boldenone aromatizes half as much as Testosterone, and William Llewellyn’s book “Anabolics” is commonly referenced to support this claim. It is assumed by many that Boldenone can be used as a makeshift Testosterone base for those prone to estrogenic side-effects. In theory, by using Boldenone, one could reduce the risk of encountering Estrogen related side-effects as it should aromatize about half that of Testosterone. Over the years other theories have developed around Boldenone's mechanism of action. One of the most recent being that one (or several) of its metabolites act as an aromatase inhibitor (AI). I have a different theory entirely, which I will delve into after elaborating on the AI hypothesis. There was an excellent post made on reddit by SwoleTide discussing the metabolites of Boldenone. I have also compiled my own research, both of which I will discuss further here. SwoleTide's Reddit Post Compiling The Boldenone Metabolite Research There’s a theory going around that metabolites of Boldenone are actually what inhibit the enzyme aromatase, consequently preventing Testosterone from aromatizing to Estradiol. SwoleTide compiled the available research on Boldenone metabolites [R]. SwoleTide starts by going over anecdotes claiming both a need for increased, decreased, or no need at all of an AI. Logically, one should require more AI on high dose Boldenone if Boldenone aromatizes as much as it is supposed to into Estradiol. However, a lot of people claim a decreased need of AI when using it, or no need at all. Boldenone's Aromatization Rate According To Llewellyn’s Book “Anabolics” William Llewellyn’s book “Anabolics” claims that “aromatization studies suggest that [boldenone's] rate of conversion to estradiol is roughly half that of testosterone”.  Llewellyn references an in vitro study to support this claim, which does not refer to Boldenone anywhere [R]. In a revised edition of “Anabolics” the reference is changed to an obscure study evaluating the role of androgens in growth and development of the fetus, child and adolescent [R]. This study does not refer to Boldenone either. It could however be a mistake by Llewellyn as a compound with a similar name, Boldione, is mentioned in the first study (the in vitro study) and apparently does interact with aromatase, however, he updated the source in a more recent copy of his book, presumably based on the fact that the new study represented correct information, but there is no mention in the updated study at all. Other Studies Suggesting Boldenone Aromatizes One study on rabbits and the effect of Boldenone had on reproductive hormones was investigated [R].  The study had two experimental groups and one control. The two experimental groups were injected with Boldenone. The control group did not get any Boldenone. Both experimental groups had a significant decrease in circulating Testosterone with a simultaneous increase in Estradiol.  In the discussion the researchers speculate that this may be due to Boldenone aromatizing into Estradiol. Boldenone Metabolite: 1,4 Dienedione or 1,4 Dienedone SwoleTide goes on to dig into the metabolite that many claim is responsible for the AI-like effects of Boldenone. No exact match on PubChem can be found when searching for these names [R, R]. Using google also shows no relevant research for 1,4 Dienedione without quotation marks around it in the context of Boldenone. When searching using quotation marks around it, one compound, Androsta-1,4-didenedione, came up. When searching for Androsta-1,4-didendione a few studies came up, with one showing that it could cause birth defects, another on “steroids on microplates with fixed silica gel”, and the last being on a ketosteroids. No results come up when searching for 1,4 Dienedone in quotation marks, it is considered a typo. One study investigated the metabolites excreted after Boldenone administration in man [R].   5β‐androst‐1‐en‐17β‐ol‐3‐one   5β‐androst‐1‐ene‐3α,17β‐diol   5β‐androst‐1‐en‐3α‐ol‐17‐one   5β‐androst‐1‐en‐6β‐ol‐3,17‐dione   5β‐androst‐1‐ene‐3,17‐dione   5α‐androst‐1‐ene‐3,17‐dione (aka 1-AD)   androsta‐1,4‐diene‐3,17‐dione (aka ADD)   androsta‐1,4‐diene‐6β,17β‐diol‐3‐one   androsta‐1,4‐dien‐6β‐ol‐3,17‐dione   Nine metabolites are produced, with two metabolites (1-AD and ADD) being similar to the ones previously mentioned. The study does not mention any AI effects. 5α-androst-1-ene-3,17,dione (aka 1-AD) 1-AD is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid. It also acts as a prohormone to 1-Testosterone [R]. In an in vitro study it was shown that 1-AD is a potent inhibitor of aromatase activity and CYP19 mRNA expression [R]. Androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (aka ADD) ADD is an anabolic androgenic steroid related to Boldenone and Testosterone. ADD rapidly metabolizes to Boldenone [R, R]. In an in vitro study ADD was shown to inhibit aromatase [R]. WADA Study on Boldenone Metabolizing To ATD ATD was not listed in the human metabolite study conducted on Boldenone [R]. Just as with ADD, ATD has been show to both be a metabolite of Boldenone and metabolize into Boldenone [R, R]. In an in vitro study ATD was shown to significantly lower Estrogen biosynthesis [R]. 1,4 Dienedione: Mistake or Just Plain Wrong? When comparing the structures of 1-AD, ADD, ATD and the data available behind them, it seems that 1,4 Dienedione is just an incorrect attempt to shorten ADD after all. PubChem did not show it as a synonym as it was not indexed on PubMed. SwoleTide speculates why this mistake occurred and explains why it is incorrect. It is also misleading to call it an AI because it is an AAS as well that just so happens to have AI like effects, but also aromatizes itself. Major Issue With All The Studies Showing AI effects All the studies referenced are done in vitro. In vitro studies and animal studies do not always translate into humans in practical application, so extrapolations should be not taken as fact without digging further. Genetic Variability SwoleTide touches on the importance of acknowledging genetic variability and how it is entirely possible that some individuals may metabolize Boldenone to ADD, 1-AD or ATD at a higher rate than others, or may hyper-respond to these metabolites. Drug response is different individual to individual, and even the metabolism of naturally produced endogenous steroids vastly differs person to person. Some individuals simply don't respond to certain drugs at all too, which needs to be considered. Conclusion by SwoleTide on the Metabolite Research The research is not clear on if Boldenone acts as an AI, or if it aromatizes into Estradiol. Major Flaw In The Rabbit Study Explaining the High Estradiol SwoleTide did an amazing job compiling the research and citing everything. I want to start with my interpretation of the rabbit study [R]. This study was conducted in a monotherapy context, meaning they only injected the rabbits with Boldenone. We see a decrease in Testosterone and increase in Estradiol.  Logically, if there is no Testosterone being administered and it is only Boldenone, and Estradiol levels clearly increase from baseline, then Boldenone must aromatize to Estradiol then right? Wrong, at least in my opinion. If we look at how they measured these biomarkers we can see that they collected blood and did a subsequent hormonal assay. Serum Testosterone and Estradiol levels were determined using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) kits.  Our favourite shitty test, ECLIA. What is the problem with ECLIA? ECLIA cross-detects other estrogens in the body. I have elaborated on this in detail in my Nandrolone monotherapy post, as well as specifically in my post breaking down why you need to get sensitive assay Estradiol testing.  During my Nandrolone-only experiment I tested my Estradiol with ECLIA and got a 36.8 pg/mL result. When the same sample of blood was tested using high sensitivity testing, it was revealed that my Estradiol was actually only 9.9 pg/mL. Why do we see this huge variation? ECLIA cross-detects other estrogens in the body and detected my Estrone, consequently artificially inflating my ECLIA test results significantly. This means that we can already conclude that the Estradiol levels in the Boldenone rabbit study are artificially inflated. In the case of Nandrolone it spikes Estrone significantly, and we can see that ECLIA reflects a false spike in Estradiol levels as a result of this. Estrone can convert to Estradiol in the body, but it does not occur at a significant rate. So, we already know that the values via ECLIA are not very accurate when assessing Estradiol. Is it a coincidence that whenever someone on Boldenone tests their blood via LC/MS/MS their results are vastly different than with ECLIA? No. We consistently see crushed Estradiol levels on high doses of Boldenone via high sensitivity testing. And this brings me to my next piece of evidence to support my theory. Anecdotes And Blood Work Showing Boldenone Lowering Estradiol Levels Vigorous Steve’s Experience With High Dose Boldenone + Testosterone Vigorous Steve has a very good youtube channel and is someone I consider extremely knowledgeable about bodybuilding and pharmacology. Steve responds very well to high dose Testosterone only cycles and has pushed his dosages pretty high. Normally when he is on a gram of Testosterone per week, he needs to take 12.5 mg Aromasin every day to ward off estrogenic side effects. When he blasted a gram of Testosterone and a gram of Boldenone per week however, he noticed he didn't need the same amount of Aromasin per week, as the introduction of EQ had actually reduced his estrogenic burden. Despite adding 1000 mg of another drug that supposedly aromatizes at half the rate of Testosterone, he needed less AI, on double the amount of drugs. High Sensitivity Blood Test Results On 300 mg Boldenone And 400 mg Testosterone A friend of mine gave me high sensitivity blood test results to reference from his last Boldenone cycle. The results helped shed more light on what is really going on here. This is the time line of his cycle:  2/18/19 – Started blast: 400 mg Testosterone Cypionate / 200 mg NPP weekly (needed 0.25 mg Arimidex twice a week to keep Estrogenic side effects at bay) 5/31/19 – Switched to TRT Cruise consisting of: 100 mg Testosterone Cypionate / 900IU HCG (300 IU x 3) per week 7/19/19 – Full TRT Labs done. Estradiol blood test result came back at 75 pg/mL.  7/19/19 – Started blast phase with Equipoise in it later that day after blood draw of 400 mg Testosterone Cypionate/300 mg Equipoise per week and 20 mg Anavar per day 9/2/19 – Drew bloods while still on 400 mg Testosterone Cypionate/300 mg Equipoise per week and 20 mg Anavar per day 9/4/19 – Estradiol blood test result came back at 24 pg/mL, despite being on 400 mg of Testosterone Cypionate  He was on 4 times the dose of Testosterone, and 300 mg of Boldenone which supposedly aromatizes at 50% the rate of Testosterone, and yet his Estradiol decreased from 75 pg/mL down to 24 pg/mL. The first thing I asked was if he was using ECLIA or sensitive assay. He told me all blood tests were done using ultra-sensitive LC/MS-MS assay. So this is another individual showing that Boldenone decreased his Estradiol significantly on cycle. High Sensitivity Blood Test Results On 850 mg Boldenone And 250 mg Testosterone Per Week Youtuber Symmetry and Fitness took things a step further and not only tested his Estradiol levels on Boldenone via sensitive assay testing, but he also tested his Estrone levels, which came back with some very interesting results. His cycle was comprised of approximately 850 mg of Boldenone and 250 mg of Testosterone per week.    His results show a massive increase in Estrone, with a result of 662 pg/mL, with the top end of the reference range being 65 pg/mL. His Estradiol was undetectable with less than 2.5 pg/mL.  Normally on this much Testosterone your Estradiol levels would be above the top end of the reference range. Even with natural endogenous Testosterone production you would have somewhere around 15-35 pg/mL (depending on how much Testosterone you produce and other factors). These blood test results show his Estradiol is even lower than a woman in menopause. If you know anything about Estradiol, you know how important it is to avoid crashing it. This test result indicates that something in his stack is preventing the Testosterone in his body from aromatizing into Estradiol. Unpacking this further, we know the Testosterone is legitimately Testosterone, as he tested his blood using LC/MS-MS, which is the gold standard for Total Testosterone to avoid cross-detection of other anabolics. So, we know he legitimately has a 1431 ng/dL Total Testosterone level. That amount of Testosterone would normally produce an Estradiol that is high, not one that is crushed into the ground. So, either the enzyme is being inhibited, or something else is going on. Fortunately, with his Estrone blood test result, we can finally solve the puzzle here on what is actually happening. Referring back to the rabbit study, we know that they used ECLIA to test Estradiol [R].  The rabbit study showed an elevation of Estradiol on Boldenone monotherapy, and coincidentally, of all the individuals who have reported proportional Estradiol levels in their blood work to their dose of AAS, none of them were using high sensitivity testing (at least of those that I have seen to date). Symmetry and Fitness has a verifiably high Testosterone level, no Estradiol, and a cranked through the roof Estrone. All blood test results showing an elevation in Estradiol are using ECLIA. So, I hypothesize that Boldenone doesn't actually aromatize into Estradiol, nor does it inhibit the enzyme aromatase, rather, it competes with Testosterone to interact with aromatase to produce its own estrogenic metabolite. I will delve into this further in the next subsection, but a quick takeaway from this is that you would very likely need to use exogenous Estradiol with Boldenone to actually get a physiological amount of circulating Estradiol into your body. The reason being that Boldenone clearly does not aromatize into a sufficient amount of Estradiol, and instead produces a far weaker estrogen with completely different pharmacodynamics. Estrone in particular is not satisfactory to achieve the same health benefits or muscle growth in the body as Estradiol, and there are numerous studies showing how deleterious disproportionately high Estrone levels can be to your health. Alternatively, a much lower dose of Boldenone would need to be deployed relative to Testosterone if competition is the main thing we're concerned with, but even at a nearly identical dosage scheme, we saw in the second example I gave where only 300 mg Boldenone significantly impaired adequate aromatization of 400 mg Testosterone to Estradiol. Almost nobody using Boldenone is using less than 300 mg, and if only that much is already that problematic, then it will be difficult to find a place for it in a health conscious protocol, or even just a protocol intended for maximum muscle growth in general. It is subpar in both categories. Boldenone's Effects On Estrogen Biosynthesis As previously mentioned, the use of exogenous Estradiol is most likely necessary to maintain healthy levels on a high dose Boldenone cycle. The principal pathway Estrone is biosynthesized through involves Androstenedione as an intermediate, with Androstenedione being transformed into Estrone by the enzyme Aromatase. This is key to remember in the context of this Boldenone deep dive. Androstenedione transforms into Estrone via the enzyme Aromatase. This reaction occurs in both the gonads and in certain other tissues, particularly adipose tissue (hence why if you're fatter you aromatize more), and Estrone is subsequently secreted from these tissues. In addition to aromatization of Androstenedione, Estrone is also formed reversibly from Estradiol by the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) in various tissues, including the liver. Simply put, you would never ever see levels of Estrone in men naturally like Symmetry and Fitness had on his cycle. Anecdotally, we see that the need for AI usage goes down, and Estradiol levels get crushed, even on a high dose of Testosterone when adding Boldenone to cycles. We also see blood test results showing sky high Estrone levels. Some of Boldenone's metabolites are touted to be AI's, but the evidence of this is based on extrapolation from animal studies, in vitro models, and the fact that we see decreased Estradiol levels on high sensitivity blood test results. This all leads me to believe that Boldenone does not act as an AI, and even if its metabolites do, the degree to which they do is clearly insignificant or else we would't have this massive spike in Estrone in the blood. What is actually happening in my opinion is that Boldenone is a potent substrate for aromatase too, but does not aromatize directly into bioidentical Estradiol, it aromatizes into Estrone, or another synthetic Estrogen entirely. Why we all took for granted that it would convert to straight bioidentical Estradiol when it is a synthetic anabolic steroid is beyond me. If aromatase was inhibited by Boldenone's metabolites, we wouldn't see Estrone levels spike, nor would we see Estradiol levels spike via ECLIA. That test cross detects other Estrogens, and it is only via high sensitivity testing that we can see what is actually going on. The fact that Estrogens are being detected at all clearly indicates that the enzyme aromatase is functioning just fine, and something is pushing through it, and clearly it isn't the Testosterone during high dose Boldenone cycles as Estradiol gets crushed into the ground. My question would be what is the binding affinity of Boldenone relative to Testosterone for aromatase, and what are the Estrogenic metabolites being created during that enzymatic conversion process. Keep in mind, Symmetry and Fitness had high sensitivity testing for Testosterone and Estradiol, however, his Estrone test was done using ECLIA methodology.  Hence, the Estrone could very well be a cross detection too of another synthetic Estrogenic metabolite. And that is probably the case after all, as he commented on my video and stated that he had subsequent followup testing done to assess his Estrone levels via LC/MS/MS. And this time, they came back as normal.  Testosterone To Estradiol Ratios And The Cap On Aromatase Activity Something that often goes overlooked is that there is a cap on aromatase activity in the body. Once you start pushing into supraphysiological dosage territory with AAS, your body does not have a proportional amount of aromatase enzymes to process it all and spit out a perfectly proportional amount of Estradiol (or whatever metabolites the AAS you are using may or may not produce). Studies measuring graded dose response to Testosterone in young and old men have shown that the Estradiol:Testosterone ratio actually decreases the further into supraphysiological dosing territory Testosterone administration goes.  On 25 mg Testosterone per week the total E2-to-T ratio in a young man is about 1.2%. At 50 mg it goes down to about 0.7%. At 125 mg it goes down to about 0.4%. And so on.  You can clearly see that aromatization doesn't occur in a parallel manner to Testosterone dosage, suggesting that there is a limited amount of aromatization that can occur, and that synthetic AAS will likely be competing with Testosterone for that limited aromatase activity. It is physically impossible for the body to push out a proportional amount of Estrogen when dosages get into supraphysiological territory, so I don't know how anyone could expect that Testosterone will somehow aromatize perfectly fine into Estradiol when it is competing with a huge drug load (Boldenone) that is also a substrate for aromatase. Analogous to how anti-androgens will compete for the androgen receptor with Testosterone and DHT, Boldenone most likely competes with Testosterone for aromatase. Another relevant example is what happens after using a 5α-Reductase inhibitor like Finasteride. When you inhibit 5α-reductase with Finasteride or Dutasteride to lower DHT levels in the body, in the least scientific jargon possible, Testosterone is essentially “out-competed” by Finasteride. When Testosterone can't convert to DHT because of enzyme inhibition or competition, it is left as circulating Testosterone, which then consequently increases the Total Testosterone level in the body, and as a byproduct increases Estradiol levels because there is now more circulating Testosterone in the body than there would have been if 5α-reductase was available to interact with. This is why Finsteride will increase Testosterone and Estradiol levels in the body by roughly 15%, and Dutasteride by over 20%. So, if an enzyme has a cap on how much it can interact with hormones to create metabolite hormones, introducing another substrate with comparable binding affinity and/or dosage (there are other factors as well) into the equation just further decreases the amount of available enzymes for the parent hormones to interact with (Testosterone being the parent hormone in this context we are referring to). I wouldn't be surprised if using Boldenone with Testosterone actually causes a modest spike in Testosterone and DHT levels in the body above and beyond what that same dose of Testosterone would otherwise provide on its own for the exact same reason that Finasteride increases Testosterone and Estradiol in the body. If aromatase is occupied by a bunch of Boldenone, there will be more circulating Testosterone, and thus more Testosterone to 5α-reduce into DHT. Now, in theory one could likely still leverage Boldenone if their dose of Testosterone was significantly higher than Boldenone, but blood test results suggest that the Testosterone dose needs to be A LOT higher for there to not be a significant impairment of Testosterone > Estradiol conversion. Even just 300 mg of Boldenone dropped Estradiol levels far below what they should have been at on 400 mg of Testosterone, consequently impairing health and muscle growth relative to what could have been achieved with another adjunct anabolic that doesn't compete with Testosterone for aromatase. It should also be considered that Boldenone is considered by most to be a relatively weak anabolic, and to date I have yet to hear of one person who is using high Test with low Boldenone. There is even a broscience rule that has passed down the grapevine stating that EQ only works well at dosages above 600-700 mg. I've even seen people say “EQ shines at 1500 mg”. Insanity. You know what else shines on 1500 mg EQ? The big red flashing 0 on your sensitive assay Estradiol blood test results after you get your blood drawn on that dose of EQ. But I digress. My Conclusion In my opinion, Boldenone interacts with aromatase itself and produces an estrogenic metabolite that artificially inflates ECLIA blood test results. It may or may not convert into Estrone, but my guess is that it doesn't convert to anything bioidentical, but does convert to a synthetic estrogen that has its own unique affinity for ERα and ERβ. Now the question really becomes what is that synthetic Estrogen, and how potent is it at fulfilling the same physiological functions as Estradiol. This is the question we commonly arrive at with Dianabol or Trestolone (MENT), but for some reason with Boldenone it is overlooked entirely. At least we know what to expect from the methylestradiol via Dbol and the 7α-methylestradiol via MENT. With Boldenone we have no idea what's going on, but anecdotally its estrogenic activity seems lacklustre, and the fact that it essentially completely inhibits the aromatization of Testosterone > Estradiol makes it a very difficult compound to leverage effectively and safely. Research also suggests that Boldenone is one of the most nephrotoxic compounds in existence. The competition for aromatase, the subsequent inhibition of downstream cascades affecting important physiological functions, the huge spike in blood viscosity, and the potential kidney toxicity all make this a compound that is hard to find a place for in performance enhancing drug stacks. While there are some unique performance focused scenarios in which I believe it could be leveraged effectively, for most individuals I do not think this is a compound worth messing with.

    "content": "Anadrol Dosage – 50 mg Vs. 100 mg Oxymetholone Results Comparison     In a study evaluating dose-response to a moderate and high Anadrol dosage, muscle and strength gains from 50 mg per day and 100 mg per day were compared. By now you've probably heard me outline the “less is more” concept when it comes to steroid use. On one side of the spectrum, the clinical data does show that the more steroids you use, the more muscle you will gain over the span of a cycle. However, the same studies also reveal a dose-dependent decline in muscle growth response relative to increased drug load. Basically, more works better, but there are diminishing returns the higher your dosages go, and how much muscle you net over the span of your life bodybuilding will likely differ based on how aggressively you approach your mass building phases.  50 mg Vs. 100 mg Anadrol Study Results In the following study, we can see changes in body weight, lean body mass (what we mainly care about), and fat loss in response to a moderate and high Anadrol dosage (50 mg vs. 100 mg) [R].  The placebo group didn't gain any lean body mass, nor did they lose any body fat. The 50 mg Anadrol treated group gained 3.3 kilograms of lean body mass and lost 2.6 kg of fat. The 100 mg Anadrol treated group gained 4.2 kilograms of lean body mass and lost 2.5 kg of fat.  Looking at lean body mass, we can see that when comparing the two dosage groups, the 100 mg group only gained 0.9 kg lean body mass more than the 50 mg group. This is after three-month exposure to twice the amount of drug. If we compare biomarkers between the two groups, we can see that the effect 100 mg of Anadrol had on ALT and AST levels was far more deleterious than the 50 mg group. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are commonly used biomarkers for assessing liver damage.     Placebo 50 mg/day 100 mg/day PValue   ALT, U/l 0 ± 2 21 ± 15 72 ± 67 0.001   AST, U/l 1 ± 2 14 ± 6 38 ± 29 <0.0001    Doubling the Anadrol dosage only yielded an additional 27% of muscle growth, but resulted in a 3.4x higher spike in ALT and a 2.7x higher spike in AST levels. Those are just biomarkers in the blood too and aren't indicative of what deleterious impact doubling the dosage may have had on ventricular hypertrophy, or other commonly overlooked factors that should be used to evaluate cardiovascular health. More Is Better, Until It's Not Yes, higher dosages will yield more muscle growth in the short-term. This is established. However, in the grand scheme of things, is it worth it to pursue that additional 20-30% of progress you can get out of a cycle by doubling your dosages? Not only will you experience diminishing returns the higher your dosage climbs, but subjecting your body to a substantially greater toxic burden will ultimately shorten your bodybuilding career. “The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long.” – Lao Tzu Cranking oxidative stress through the roof with higher dosages to yield fractional returns will just bring you towards a state of deteriorated health quicker, and will likely prevent you from even being healthy enough to pursue off-season cycles down the line that you would have otherwise been able to leverage to gain more muscle had you not pushed things so aggressively in your earlier years. At some point, you are going to reach a stage where you have to choose between your health and bodybuilding, and your lifestyle practices will start to shift more in favor of longevity (if you're smart). Pushing your body unnecessarily with high dosages just gets you to that point faster. With that being said, how do you define what a “high dose” is and what a “safe dose” is? There are no safe dosages when you're using anabolic steroids, but what you can do is take the hordes of clinical data and anecdotal reports we have available and form a health conscious approach to bodybuilding based on them. Knowing where the point of diminishing returns lies with each drug and what kind of risk that drug load carries is something that needs to be seriously evaluated by all bodybuilders, and the information we have available should be considered when designing your protocols relative to your personal goals. Perhaps short-term you may not gain as much muscle as quickly as you could otherwise, but at the end of the day, less is more when you think about the long-term objective. The long-term objective is netting as much muscle gain as possible while staying healthy enough to continue bodybuilding. Be mindful of the potential for an overall greater amount of long-term muscle accrual with a relative lack of side effects when designing your protocols. What Is The Ideal Anadrol Dosage? Obviously, this is up for interpretation, but I just want to present this data to you, and you can take from that what you will. This study is just another example of why the less is more approach should be strongly considered. The dosage isn't low by any means, so let's not confuse “less is more” with low vs. high dosages. 50 mg per day of Anadrol is 350 mg per week of anabolics, which is not a low dosage. Hell, you might not need more than 25 mg per day for your personal goals, especially if it is being stacked on top of a Testosterone base. What the ideal dosage will be for you will depend on your goals and your personal state of health, but for the vast majority of users, it is very unlikely that it will ever be justified for you to use more than 50 mg of Anadrol per day. In the context of this study in particular, you would need to seriously ask yourself if doubling your dose of a hepatotoxic, lipid-crushing, erythropoietin spiking drug for three months straight is worth an additional 0.9 kilogram gain in lean body mass when you could otherwise deploy a more calculated and patient approach that would probably net you more muscle growth long-term.

    "content": "The Anabolic Steroid Family Tree – A Framework That Simplifies How Different Steroids Impact Muscle Building And Performance     The anabolic steroid family tree is a framework that simplifies how different steroids impact muscle building and performance. In general, the most commonly used anabolic steroids fall into one of three different families/categories. Testosterone and its derivatives, Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and its derivatives, and Nandrolone (19-Nortestosterone) and its derivatives. Expectedly, many of the anabolic steroids in each family have similar attributes to one another. There are exceptions to this in each family, but in general breaking down anabolic steroids into the three families provides a simplified framework to identify the targeted action of each compound, as well as how they impact muscle building and overall performance.   Table of Contents ToggleHow Anabolic Steroids Enhance Muscle Building And PerformanceTestosterone And Testosterone DerivativesDihydrotestosterone (DHT) And DHT DerivativesNandrolone (19-Nortestosterone) And 19-Nortestosterone DerivativesHow To Determine Which Anabolics Are Optimal For Your Personal Goals How Anabolic Steroids Enhance Muscle Building And Performance There are countless processes in the body that are enhanced or inhibited by anabolic steroids. To avoid overcomplicating this article with minutia, I will provide a bird's-eye view of the main mechanisms that drive athletic performance or muscle building via exogenous anabolics. When choosing which anabolic agents are most conducive to an athlete's goals the following mechanisms should be taken into consideration, and compounds that are more heavily levered towards the desired effects should be favored.  Anabolic activity via androgen receptor activation, aromatization, 5α-reduction, or the downstream conversion into metabolites that facilitate increases in muscle size and strength Antagonism of glucocorticoid receptors leading to the inhibition of protein breakdown and a net increase in muscle size and strength via muscle sparing Psychoactive effects in the brain leading to stronger training and subsequent increases in muscle size Stimulation of Erythropoietin (EPO) production leading to improved aerobic performance   When you start going down rabbit holes of how different anabolics impact different functions in the body outside of the basic understanding that drugs = results, it can become very overwhelming to make heads or tails of what the optimal protocol choice is for your personal goals. At a higher level, even once you generally understand what compound choices would be wise just based on your goals, you will soon realize afterwards that you also have to factor in your tolerance of side effects with specific compounds, your current state of health, your age, your history of performance enhancing drug use, and a myriad of other factors. Wise compound selection to maximize performance varies widely between different sports. For example, an optimized protocol for a bodybuilder will likely be completely different than an optimized protocol for a MMA fighter. This article will serve as an overarching introduction to how each category can be leveraged in the anabolic steroid family tree, as well as the general approach I would take towards compound selection. Testosterone And Testosterone Derivatives Testosterone is the parent hormone of this part of the family tree, and is also technically the parent hormone of the entire anabolic steroid family tree because DHT and Nandrolone are both derived from Testosterone.  Among Testosterone, the most notable Testosterone derivatives used for performance enhancement in this family are as follows:  Testosterone  Equipoise (Boldenone) Dianabol (Methandrostenolone) Halotestin (Fluoxymesterone) Turinabol (Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone)  The three compounds from this family most commonly used in a bodybuilding context are Testosterone, Boldenone (Equipoise) and Dianabol. These three compounds are characterized mainly by their broad spectrum effects on anabolic and androgenic dependent functions, as well as their interaction with aromatase. They all have strong influences on red blood cell count, energy systems, and exhibit a hybrid of behaviors in the body analogous to how endogenous steroidogenesis would otherwise regulate balanced activity. They are anabolic, but not wildly so. In general, this class of compounds facilitates a middle ground level of muscle growth, neurological effects, and enhancement of aerobic mechanisms. Testosterone and Dianabol are both substrates for aromatase and can be enzymatically metabolized into potent estrogens. Testosterone can be metabolized into Estradiol (E2), and Dianabol can be metabolized into Methylestradiol (17α-methylestradiol). Boldenone's level of estrogenicity is less clear as there is no solid data available that provides details on its interaction with aromatase in humans. William Llewellyn stated in in his book Anabolics that Boldenone is a less potent substrate for aromatase and is enzymatically metabolized into Estrogen at 50% of the rate of Testosterone. This claim is not supported in any of the clinical data I have personally seen, so I would be hesitant to assume that Boldenone can facilitate sufficient Estrogen receptor activation in practical application as the base of a cycle. There is also speculation around whether or not certain Boldenone metabolites act as aromatase inhibitors and attenuate the estrogenic activity of the parent hormone. While this is certainly possible and warrants further research before we can make any conclusive statements about Boldenone, in general with our knowledge to date it is fairly well accepted in the community that Boldenone is mildly estrogenic, but significantly less so than Testosterone and Dianabol. Halotestin and Turinabol are not substrates for aromatase so Testosterone, Dianabol and Boldenone are the only compounds in this section of the anabolic steroid family tree that can fill the role of a “Test base” and be used as the foundation of a steroid cycle.  Unlike the main three hormones used among bodybuilders in this family, Turinabol and Halotestin are Testosterone derivatives that induce effects analogous to potent DHT derivatives. These two anabolics were chemically designed to lack estrogenic activity and a capacity to drive significant gains in mass, and be levered more towards pure protein expression and the neurological side of the spectrum. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) And DHT Derivatives The next family in the anabolic steroid family tree is Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and DHT derivatives.  DHT is the 5α-reduced metabolite of Testosterone that facilitates sexual differentiation of the male genitalia during embryogenesis and drives the maturation of boys into men during puberty. It is much more androgenic than Testosterone, and sufficient amounts of it in androgen dependent tissues is necessary during puberty to ensure full maturation is achieved. A common misconception is that steroids derived from DHT are guaranteed to be extremely androgenic simply because they are DHT derivatives. On the contrary, DHT derivatives are almost all more tissue selective than Testosterone. In general, all anabolic steroids were designed with that exact goal in mind, not just DHT derivatives. Anabolic/androgenic ratios were evaluated in preclinical animal models before transitioning to human use in a clinical setting. If a steroid did not exhibit a more favorable anabolic/androgenic ratio than Testosterone, it would have been abandoned for any application other than pure androgen replacement in males (e.g. Proviron). The DHT derivatives most commonly used for performance enhancement include the following:  Masteron (Drostanolone) Primobolan (Metenolone) Anavar (Oxandrolone) Anadrol (Oxymetholone) Winstrol (Stanozolol) Proviron (Mesterolone) Superdrol (Methasterone) DHB (Dihydroboldenone, 1-Testosterone)  DHT derivatives are often perceived to be poor choices for a mass building phase/offseason because they don't seem to produce as much hypertrophy as the Testosterone and 19-Nor families. This is another misconception, as DHT derivatives simply have more targeted action in the body. They are not substrates for aromatase like Testosterone derivatives, they don't act as potent agonists of a myriad of different receptors in the body like 19-Nors, and they don't 5α-reduce into more androgenic metabolites. DHT derivatives weed out a lot of the less predictable activity associated with the other two families and skew more towards pure protein expression and increased force production. There is no water retention, there are no progestogenic side effects, all you get is pure muscle growth and proportionally higher amounts of strength gains relative to Testosterone Derivatives and 19-Nors. DHT derivatives more or less exhibit targeted action on contractile tissue, which is why they're commonly perceived to be “weak” anabolics, when in reality it is the lack of perceived side effects being misinterpreted as “weak.” When it comes to nitrogen retention, we've seen in clinical studies that there is not a significant difference between the most potent steroids from each category of the anabolic steroid family tree. “After 1935 the best method of discovering and measuring the protein-building action of androgenic steroids in humans proved to be metabolic balance studies. In 1955, when anabolic steroids with less androgens were developed, the nitrogen-balance method was used again to evaluate and compare the nitrogen-sparing effect of the various preparations. The findings of the numerous balance studies that were performed are as follows: The injectable 17 beta-esters, such as nandrolone phenylpropionate, nandrolone decanoate and methenolone enanthate exert a strong anabolic action for several weeks, amounting to 2-2.50 g nitrogen/day, which corresponds to a daily gain of 12-15 g protein or 60-75 g lean body mass. The orally active 17-alkyl derivatives induce a dose-dependent nitrogen-saving effect of the same order.” Nitrogen retention was roughly the same between all of the steroids evaluated in the study above [R]. It is more often than not the side effects themselves that are misinterpreted as one compound being more potent than another in a muscle building context.  If you gain 5 pounds of pure water retention in a week from using Dianabol, is it a more potent muscle builder than Anavar? No, it's not. When everything is said and done, the amount of actual contractile tissue gained will be similar, but what happens to the body and how other mechanisms are augmented during that time span of you getting from point A to point B is what will differ significantly between those two compounds. Just because DHT derivatives have more targeted action, it doesn't mean that they are the ideal choice in all scenarios. In fact, sometimes the side effects of certain compounds produce more desirable outcomes, depending on the goal. In general, DHT derivatives are dry strength builders with reliable and predictable levels of anabolic activity. An example of a sport where DHT derivatives are especially useful is MMA. Fighters need to fight at as low of a weight class as possible without compromising their performance, they need to have a favorable ratio of force production relative to their body weight, and they also benefit greatly from increased aggression and neurological enhancement. That is a specific scenario where using something that is skewed more towards the accrual of mass and less androgenic activity would be the worst choice. For example, Nandrolone is 5α-reduced into DHN, a much less androgenic metabolite, and it also interacts with Progesterone receptors in the body which can have an anti-androgenic effect on the body. While that might be a compound ideal for someone seeking maximum hypertrophy with a relative lack of androgenic side effects like hair loss, in this scenario the opposite is what we would be shooting for. For a MMA fighter we want high force production and aggression with a relative lack of weight gain. This is an example of a scenario where a DHT derivative would be wise to plug in. Alternatively, that is an example of a scenario where Turinabol or Halotestin would be good options too, but that is only because they behave more like DHT derivatives than they do like Testosterone derivatives. There are exceptions to the rule in every category of the anabolic steroid family tree, and the DHT derivatives are no different as they have Anadrol. Despite being a DHT derivative, Anadrol behaves more like a 19-Nor as it drives significantly more pronounced gains in sheer mass (not to be confused with lean muscle mass) than the other DHT derivatives, and it is also an agonist of Estrogen receptors. In general though, the DHT derivatives that are most commonly leveraged by athletes are Primobolan, Masteron, Anavar and Winstrol, and they all share similar overlapping effects on body composition and performance. Nandrolone (19-Nortestosterone) And 19-Nortestosterone Derivatives The last family in the anabolic steroid family tree is Nandrolone (19-Nortestosterone) and 19-Nortestosterone derivatives.  Many don't even realize that Deca and NPP are not different drugs, and aren't even representative of the actual drug their respective esters are attached to. When someone refers to “Deca” they are referring to Nandrolone with a decanoate ester. When someone refers to “NPP” they are referring to Nandrolone with a phenylpropionate ester. The parent hormone of this family is Nandrolone (19-Nortestosterone), and all of the anabolic steroids in this category are Nandrolone derivatives. Nandrolone derivatives are most commonly referred to simply as “19-Nors” in the bodybuilding community. There are quite a few 19-Nors that have been synthesized and documented over the years, most of which are traditionally used at low dosages in women's birth control. The 19-Nors most commonly used for performance enhancement include the following:  Nandrolone (19-Nortestosterone) Trenbolone (Trienolone) Trestolone (MENT)  19-Nors are generally characterized by their anabolism and progestogenic activity. They are very anabolic, but they also exhibit significant amounts of satellite interaction with other receptors in the body. The most notable being their interaction with the Progesterone receptor. 19-Nor derived progestins are agonists of the Progesterone receptor, which means that they can bind to the Progesterone receptor and activate it. Nandrolone is not a potent substrate for aromatase, and mainly converts to a weaker Estrogen called Estrone (Estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than Estrone). Nandrolone is also mildly estrogenic on its own via its ability to act as an Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) agonist [R]. Overall, Nandrolone is much less androgenic and estrogenic than Testosterone. Trenbolone is not a substrate for aromatase, however, some data suggests that it may interact with Estrogen receptors in a similar way to Nandrolone. Trenbolone also facilitates superior muscle sparing via a handful of anti-catabolic mechanisms surrounding the glucocorticoid receptor. Trenbolone binds to the glucocorticoid receptor and acts as an antagonist [R]. It also significantly suppresses glucocorticoid expression [R]. In addition, it lowers corticosterone and cortisol levels, while concurrently inhibiting cortisol from binding to skeletal muscle glucocorticoid receptors [R, R, R]. Through these mechanisms, Trenbolone exhibits a much more robust inhibition of muscle protein breakdown than Testosterone. This is why Trenbolone seems to excel so much more than other anabolic steroids in a calorie deficit. Trestolone (MENT) is unique from other 19-Nors in that it is a substrate for aromatase, and it behaves almost like a hybrid of a 19-Nor and Testosterone. Because of this interaction with aromatase, Trestolone exhibits therapeutic promise as a potential HRT alternative, and may fill the role of a viable Test base alternative in a cycle. The 19-Nors are the most suppressive family of the anabolic steroid family tree, and will keep your HPTA suppressed even at minuscule trace amounts. Considering this, it would be prudent to reserve your use of them until you have decided if you will be blasting and cruising for the majority of your life. Even one injection of Nandrolone can keep your HPTA suppressed for months, regardless of what you do. The 19-Nor family skews more towards hypertrophy than the DHT derivatives, but is also accompanied by a myriad of satellite interaction with other receptors in the body that are less predictable and often warrant a more experienced user to responsibly manage. 19-Nors also have unique interactions with the GH/IGF-1 pathway that DHT derivatives don't, which further complicates their responsible application, but can also be leveraged for increased levels of muscle growth in certain scenarios. How To Determine Which Anabolics Are Optimal For Your Personal Goals Understanding optimal applications of anabolics and side effect management can get very complicated, especially when you get into the weeds of sport specific applications, drug testing, lack of access to certain drugs, and budget limitations. To simplify things, I highly recommend that you start your education on anabolic steroids by splitting them into the three families and working your way from the ground up. Start in the Testosterone family and learn why a Testosterone base is used in the majority of enhancement protocols. Delve into the mechanisms of Testosterone in the body, and how its aromatization into Estrogen and 5α-reduction into DHT facilitates a balancing act of anabolic and androgenic activity in the body, while simultaneously providing neuro and cardioprotection. The majority of those reading this article will not have sport specific applications or drug tests they need to get around. Considering this, the majority of you will be best served by learning about Testosterone thoroughly before even moving on to the other two families. Testosterone is the bioidentical anabolic androgen we endogenously produce and rely on, and is more often than not the most intelligent hormone to use for a first cycle. Only once you have fully leveraged the Testosterone family should you then move on to adding DHT derivatives in subsequent cycles. If you have goals that cannot be met via Testosterone and DHT derivatives, or you experience undesirable side effects from Testosterone and/or DHT derivatives, then looking to the Nandrolone family would be warranted. For a more elaborate explanation of how I would approach my first steroid cycle and each subsequent cycle thereafter if I could go back in time, I highly recommend you read my article that details what I consider to be wise dosage titration and “stacking” practices. Don't overwhelm yourself by trying to learn everything at once. Learn about Testosterone and its derivatives. Once you understand that family and know how to responsibly implement that information to achieve your goals, start learning about DHT derivatives. Once you understand that family too and know how to responsibly implement that information to achieve your goals, start learning about Nandrolone and its derivatives.

Other Pre-Workouts On The Market This is the most maxed out stimulant free pre-workout formula on the market in all aspects. It is also the most comprehensive formula that targets nitric oxide (NO), vasodilation and intracellular hyper-hydration from multiple angles, while maintaining top end dosages across all of those pathways. We completely saturate the traditional Arginine–eNOS–nitric oxide (NO) pathway with a massive 10 gram dose of L-Citrulline, 1.5 grams of Nitrosigine and 1.5 grams of Agmatine Sulfate. The often neglected nitrate–nitrite–nitric oxide (NO) pathway is also topped out with a 1500 mg dose of Sodium Nitrate. A high level of intracellular hyper-hydration is achieved with 5 grams of Creatine Monohydrate, 4 grams of Glycerpump and 4 grams of Betaine Anhydrous. We also addressed the enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with VasoDrive-AP®, which acts as an ACE inhibitor and significantly increases vasodilation.  Finally, we have 3 grams of Malic Acid added in on top of the 10 grams of pure L-Citrulline to act as a Krebs cycle intermediary and counter lactic acid buildup during training. Some of these pathways are so maxed out that we could have easily just chosen one of them and sold the product for $39.99 and still had one of the most potent pre-workouts in the industry. Instead, I packed it all into one absurd product that clocks in with over 30 grams of efficacious active ingredients per full dose. It was incredibly expensive to create, but I am very happy with how it turned out, and I am not exaggerating when I say that this pre-workout is absolutely unmatched. Basically, I just included exactly what I would want to see in a stimulant free pre-workout, even at the obvious detriment of our margins. This product is even more potent than Gorilla Mode when it comes to pure pump and performance. The full daily dose is 2 scoops. Even a half dose (1 scoop) is still far more potent than the majority of other pre-workouts out there at their max dosages. This is another product I wanted to be head and shoulders, clear as day, superior to everything else in the industry. Just like in my description of how Gorilla Mode stacks up to other products in this industry, we can actually back up why our product is better than the rest. When (insert fitness influencer name here) launches their own supplement line, they will regurgitate the same story about how their products are effectively dosed, only use the highest quality ingredients, blah blah blah. They don't even know what they're selling half the time, let alone what combinations of ingredients work synergistically, or how to dose a product properly. They employ others to manufacture their products, or use a pre-made formula their manufacturer uses for every company where they just slap a different label on it and sell it for a huge margin. At the end of the day, most fitness influencers have no idea what goes into making an effective product. They don't know how their products work, they probably wouldn’t even use them if they didn’t sell them, they didn't formulate them, and they have to pay the overhead involved with having a team under them who is responsible for all of that. As you’ve already experienced with Gorilla Mode and Gorilla Mind Nootropics, it is me formulating the products, and they work because I actually put in them what I would want in a product and buy myself if I didn’t have a company. The same applies with Gorilla Mode Nitric. If I didn’t have this product, for an effective stim-free pre-workout I would probably be mixing up 6000-10,000 mg of L-Citrulline for vasodilation (with 6000 mg being the bare minimum of pure L-Citrulline, not Citrulline Malate, and would be dependent on my budget at the time), a saturation dose of Creatine Monohydrate (5000 mg), 3000-4000 mg of Glycerpump to hyper-hydrate the muscle with water, and maybe a quarter teaspoon of Himalayan Pink Salt. The fact that a significant amount of supplement companies will skimp out on Creatine Monohydrate and either not include it at all, or only include a subpar dosage, really sheds light on how scammy this industry can be. That is the cheapest ingredient they could easily dose properly, and even that they won't shell out the money for in their formulas. It’s not hard to put 5 grams of Creatine in a pre-workout, and it is actually pretty cheap to put in there. The reason is, they want you to go buy their creatine product, and will intentionally manipulate their ingredient profile to be deficient in several areas to make you buy more stuff from them. With my products, everything is turnkey. You don’t need to go buy a separate Creatine product from us, you don’t need to stack extra stims on top of our stim-based products, you don’t need to go buy something else to get the max dose of a certain ingredient in any of our formulas, everything you need is in each product at an efficacious dosage. Flavor And Mixability The flavor we chose to start with for Nitric was Mango Peach as it is a more mainstream appealing flavor than Tiger's Blood. Tiger's Blood and a fruit punch flavor will probably be next in the pipeline of flavor releases. Mango Peach is easily a 9 or 10/10 flavor, even for the pickiest of tongues. As there’s such a high concentration of ingredients in this formula we were really happy with how the flavor systems turned out. We were expecting something this potent to be nearly impossible to avoid tasting like ass. Fortunately, that wasn’t the case. It also mixes very well considering the concentration of L-Citrulline, GlycerPump, and all of the other ingredients in this product. There is some grittiness, but that just comes with the territory with putting out a 35 gram serving size product with 10 grams of L-Citrulline and 4 grams of Glycerpump. You will just have to use a bit more water than you would with your standard pre-workout because there are simply more active ingredients in this product that will require more liquid to mix well. How To Dose Gorilla Mode Nitric Mix 1-2 scoops of Gorilla Mode Nitric in 12-14 ounces of water and consume 30 minutes prior to training. Vary the amount of water to achieve your desired flavor level. First time users should begin use with 1/2-1 scoop or less to evaluate tolerance. DO NOT EXCEED 2 SCOOPS IN ANY 24 HOUR PERIOD. Gorilla Mode Nitric Ingredients Breakdown L-Citrulline – 10,000 mg L-Citrulline is the most effective supplement you can use to boost nitric oxide (NO) in the body. Why Nitric Oxide (NO) Is Important Nitric oxide (NO) is made naturally in our bodies and plays a significant role in cardiovascular health. It dilates blood vessels (vasodilation), which lowers blood pressure and increases oxygen in the blood.    Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a messenger to signal blood vessels to dilate, or contract and relax. Sufficient nitric oxide is needed to signal blood vessels to contract or relax to ensure blood is able to flow to and from the heart effectively. Nitric oxide production decreases with age, consequently reducing the elasticity of the cardiovascular system, and impairing the body's ability to ensure sufficient amounts of oxygenated blood are reaching vital organs. Eating enough nitrates and/or supplementing with nitric oxide precursors is very important to ensure that your cardiovascular system maintains optimized function as you get older. In addition, maintaining optimal nitric oxide levels will make you more vascular, allow you to get a much better pump, increase muscle volume, enhance the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to working muscles, support recovery and improve overall physical performance. Increased Muscular Endurance Citrulline has also shown to significantly increase muscular endurance, with one study finding that compared to placebo, a single 8000 mg dose of Citrulline Malate increased the number of reps performed per set, on every set after set 2 [R]. The impact Citrulline had on performance increased the more sets were performed. During the last set performed, the group that took Citrulline had a 52.92% increase in the number of reps they could perform relative to placebo. It also decreased muscle soreness by 40% at 24 and 48 hours after the training session compared to placebo. Effect On Body Composition There isn’t much data on the direct effect Citrulline has on muscle growth and fat loss in humans. However, a rodent model assessed the effect Citrulline had on body composition and found that 20 month old rats that were given a diet that included the human equivalent dose of 160 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks had 13% less body fat and 9% more lean body mass relative to the rats fed a standard diet without Citrulline supplementation [R]. Visceral fat mass was also reduced by 32%. The mortality rate of the rats taking Citrulline was 0%, while the standard diet fed rats had a mortality rate of 20%. L-Citrulline is one of the most promising supplements on the market and has significantly more upside above and beyond its increase in vascularity and pumps in the gym. The Maximum Effective Dose Of L-Citrulline Citrulline is found in watermelons. You would need to eat 1.5 kg of watermelon every day to get 3 grams of L-Citrulline though, which is the minimum effective dose [R]. To get the maximum effective dose of L-Citrulline from your diet, you would need to eat 5.0 kg of watermelon per day to get 10 grams (10,000 mg) of L-Citrulline [R].  Obviously, nobody is going to eat that much watermelon, nor is it a good idea to begin with in my opinion when there are far better ways to allocate your macronutrient/micronutrient intake allotments. This is why L-Citrulline supplementation could actually be worthwhile. The Problem With Citrulline Malate In The Supplement Industry While L-Citrulline is a great supplement to have in your daily regimen, there is a red flag around L-Citrulline supplementation that you need to know about. I'm sure you've seen that some supplements have L-Citrulline in them, and some have Citrulline Malate. Some even say “L-Citrulline Malate”. This is a cheap trick companies use to deceive customers. Citrulline Malate is composed of 50% Malic Acid, unless the ratio states otherwise. Authentic Citrulline Malate is produced by chemically bonding free-form L-Citrulline to DL-Malic Acid. When L-Citrulline is chemically bonded to DL-Malic Acid, the end result is Citrulline Malate, which has unique properties. But the problem with the Citrulline Malate in the supplement industry is that it doesn't have this chemical reaction. It's just Citrulline mixed with malic acid in a big mixing vat in the manufacturing facility. There is no chemical bond like there should be to create authentic Citrulline Malate. It's just the two ingredients being mixed together in a cheap blend, and it's sold as “Citrulline Malate”, or “L-Citrulline Malate”. The reality is that it's just Citrulline stirred up with malic acid. While this isn't a huge deal in itself, the problem lies in the labeling practices companies use to artificially inflate the perceived potency of their product. 6-8 grams is seen as the max clinically proven efficacious dosage in the supplement industry in general. At least, that's what companies will tell you in their marketing. First of all, we already know that the actual maximum efficacious dosage of L-Citrulline is 10 grams per day [R]. In addition, the main issue is that the “L-Citrulline” in their product is actually as low as half of the stated label claim. As mentioned, Citrulline Malate is just a mixture of Citrulline and malic acid. Somehow, companies are getting away with labeling their products with the chemically bonded form Citrulline Malate and claiming they have 6-8 grams per serving in their pre-workout, when they actually just have 3-4 grams of Citrulline and 3-4 grams of malic acid per serving. Instead of labeling the following:  L-Citrulline – 3 grams Malic Acid – 3 grams  These companies are labeling their products like this:  Citrulline Malate – 6 grams  Or like this:  L-Citrulline Malate – 6 grams  Making you think you are getting a high dose, when in reality you are getting the bare minimum efficacious dose per serving of 3 grams. Sometimes, companies will tweak the ratio to be a bit more in favor of a higher Citrulline content relative to malic acid, but this is rarely higher than a 2:1 ratio. So, if you see the following:  Citrulline Malate (2:1) – 6 grams  That just means that the company has 4 grams of L-Citrulline and 2 grams of malic acid per serving. This is the exact manufacturing process involved in producing the L-Citrulline and “Citrulline Malate” you get in pre-workouts in the supplement industry: As you can see, the Citrulline Malate manufacturing flowchart on the right literally just says, “mix”. If this was authentic Citrulline Malate, you wouldn't need to mix L-Citrulline with malic acid, it would be chemically bonded together by the end of the manufacturing process. You're not really getting what you're paying for, and most don't realize this is a tactic in the industry to get better margins and artificially inflate a products perceived efficacy. Even if a pre-workout had what on paper appears to be a top end efficacious dose of 8 grams per serving, how much L-Citrulline are you actually getting out of that serving? 4-6 grams at most. I have yet to see a pre-workout formula actually hit a top end L-Citrulline dosage, and of the ones that get close, they use Citrulline Malate to inflate their label. In addition, even if you had the bonded version (which supplements don't), reacted Citrulline Malate will break apart into L-Citrulline and malic acid right away after its mixed in water. It's all just a trick to artificially inflate a products perceived potency on a label, as each ingredient should be listed separately. Most supplements have malic acid anyways in the “other ingredients” section, which is still an active ingredient that does have some potential performance benefits that you would get from the “Malate” portion of Citrulline Malate. L-Citrulline and malic acid work via a different mechanism of action. Citrulline bypasses the liver and gets converted to arginine, which increases NO levels in the body. Malic acid is a Krebs cycle intermediary that counters lactic acid buildup. How much do you need of each though? With Citrulline, we know where the top end data lies. Malic acid, we don't. There is research on Citrulline and Citrulline Malate, but not much data on supplementing with malic acid to replenish depleted levels as a Krebs cycle intermediary. I don't think we can make a generalized overview on how effective the malic acid component was in the Citrulline Malate research either because we can't determine if the results were derived from the malic acid, the L-Citrulline, or both. Considering this, I included an additional 3000 mg of malic acid separately in the Gorilla Mode Nitric formula as an active ingredient in the main ingredients panel. As mentioned, malic acid is most commonly used as a filler in supplements, and will be found in small amounts in many product “other ingredients” sections. The only other time it is used is by companies artificially inflating their perceived L-Citrulline dosage via Citrulline Malate. No companies are including a maxed out dose of pure L-Citrulline as well as malic acid separetely though. It is always a subpar amount of each. So, if there is some sort of performance enhancing benefit to having a high dose of malic acid, you are also getting it via Nitric on top of the maximum efficacious 10,000 mg dose of pure L-Citrulline. At the end of the day, for vasodilation you should concern yourself with is how much pure L-Citrulline is in your pre-workout supplement. I have yet to see a product with more than 6000 mg of PURE L-Citrulline. I have only seen a handful of products with 6 grams of L-Citrulline, and another handful of products with 8 grams of Citrulline Malate (which only yields 4-5 grams of actual L-Citrulline, with the remainder as malic acid). I put 10 grams of PURE L-Citrulline in Gorilla Mode Nitric, as well as 3 grams of malic acid separately, so you can get the full benefits of the max dosage of each ingredient and transparently see exactly what you are actually getting in the product. Even if you decide to only use a half dose of this product you will still get 5000 mg of pure L-Citrulline, and the formula is still top notch even when cut in half. Citrulline Vs Arginine One of the most well-known pump ingredients is Arginine. The problem with L-Arginine is that it is very ineffective at increasing Nitric Oxide synthesis. Logically, you would assume that taking Arginine would be the most effective way to increase Arginine levels in the body. However, this is not the case. Oral L-Arginine is taken up and metabolized by the liver so much that it does not actually effectively increase Arginine levels, and it may even be unsafe to use because of how much excessive urea it yields [R]. L-Citrulline bypasses the liver and passes freely to the kidneys where it is metabolized to Arginine [R]. The most effective supplement that can be used to increase Arginine levels in the body to improve cardiovascular and metabolic health outcomes is L-Citrulline [R]. L-Citrulline supplementation has shown to lower blood pressure and provide atherogenic-endothelial protection [R]. When it comes to NO precursors that significantly improve pumps, nothing beats an efficacious dose of pure L-Citrulline. Creatine Monohydrate – 5000 mg Creatine is the best studied and most effective performance enhancing supplement outside of exogenous hormones and drugs. Creatine’s Effect On Muscle Size And Strength Supplementing with creatine has shown time and time again to significantly improve strength, power output and muscle size [R]. Creatine’s effect on strength is facilitated by increasing the body’s stores of phosphocreatine, which is then used during high intensity exercise to produce ATP [R, R]. Creatine’s effect on muscle size is facilitated by drawing water into the muscle via osmosis, consequently increasing body weight and muscle size. In addition, with the increased strength creatine provides, heavier weights can be used in the gym which provide more stimulus for growth, consequently increasing muscle accrual in the long-term. Creatine supplementation also appears to increase the number of myonuclei that satellite cells will donate to damaged muscle fibers, which increases the potential for growth of those fibers [R]. A typical omnivorous diet provides about 1 gram of creatine per day, which isn’t enough to get the benefits you would from supplementation, and also isn’t nearly enough to support health status and methylation in those with genetic polymorphisms. Creatine’s Effect On Methylation And Health Status About 1 gram of creatine is endogenously produced in the body naturally in young healthy adults [R]. Most of the human body's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle, while the remainder is distributed in the blood, brain, and other tissues [R]. While there are a host of processes in the body that rely on creatine to be carried out optimally (and are often completely neglected), one of the most notable functions of creatine is neurological support [R]. In addition, the endogenous synthesis of creatine relies on a process called methylation. Arginine and Glycine are combined by an enzyme to form guanidinoacetate, which is then methylated into creatine. The problem is that this process is dependent on a mechanism of action that is commonly inhibited in the general population via endogenous Arginine deficiency, Glycine deficiency, or MTHFR polymorphisms. The MTHFR gene codes for an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or MTHFR. This enzyme is needed for the production of DNA and methylation pathways that are essential for all bodily functions. Genetic variations in this gene results in reduced activity of the enzyme and has been associated with cardiovascular disease, neurological defects, some forms of cancer, and a myriad of other diseases and disorders [R, R]. Personally, I am homozygous for C677T of MTHFR, which results in a 80-90% decrease in my efficiency in processing folic acid.  The direct reflection of that in blood biomarkers can be high homocysteine and low B12 and folate levels. I determined this via a simple 23andMe genetics test.  Upwards of 45% of your body’s methylation demands are used to synthesize creatine. For someone with a MTHFR polymorphism, you can put a significant amount of stress on your methylation pathway and deplete far more methyl groups than you should be just to create the 1 gram per day that you endogenously synthesize. We lose up to 2-3 grams of creatine per day because it converts to creatinine and is then passed out of the body via urine. As you can see, adequate replenishment of creatine is probably not being accomplished if you aren’t consistently eating a fair bit of meat or fish. And for those with impaired methylation pathways, supplementing with exogenous creatine is likely the only way creatine replenishment can be achieved. One study found that supplementing with 5 grams of creatine per day lowered plasma homocysteine levels by almost 50% in the subject who is homozygous for C677T of MTHFR [R]. Creatine supplementation can significantly lower the body’s demands for methylation and prevent the depletion of methyl groups. This is why I personally supplement with 5 grams of creatine per day. Do You Need To Cycle Off Of Creatine? No, you do not need to cycle off of creatine. Your body does not get used to it, and long-term use has shown to be safe in healthy adults [R]. Betaine Anhydrous – 4000 mg Betaine, also called Trimethylglycine, acts as a methyl donor and an osmolyte in the body. Earlier in the creatine breakdown, I briefly outlined the importance of having a sufficient amount of methyl donors available for methylation processes in the body, including the endogenous synthesis of creatine. For some individuals (depending on PEMT gene variations) Betaine can substitute for folate and B12 in the regeneration of methionine and can be choline sparing via this mechanism. It can also provide additional needed methyl donors when over-depletion occurs in genetically predisposed individuals that do not supplement with creatine, or have other deficiencies. As an osmolyte, Betaine helps balance fluid levels inside and outside of cells. The main reason I included Betaine in this formula is for its ability to induce intracellular hyper-hydration. By improving hydration status in cells, Betaine increases the pump you get in the gym, and can help prevent dehydration during exercise. Research has also shown that Betaine supplementation may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as improve digestion and liver function [R, R, R, R]. In a performance enhancing context, Betaine supplementation has also shown to increase power, endurance, muscle growth and fat loss [R, R, R]. How significant will this effect on body composition be in practical application? Negligible in my honest opinion, but the enhanced pump made this ingredient worthwhile to add into the formula. GlycerPump™ (65% Glycerol Powder) – 4000 mg Glycerol significantly enhances pumps and performance by hyper-hydrating the muscle with water. Glycerol’s Effect On Hydration, Pumps And Endurance If you drink a lot of water with nothing else in hopes of hyper-hydrating your muscles, the fall in osmolarity in your body stimulates the kidneys to remove most of the excess water within an hour. If you add glycerol to the water, this prevents the drop in osmolarity and can extend the hyper-hydration of your muscles by up to four hours. By adding Glycerol to your pre-workout, you can hold upwards of an extra liter of water via this hyper-hydrating effect. Hydration is one of the most critical factors when it comes to performance. Aside from massive pumps, Glycerol use has shown to increase endurance by as much as 24%, as well as improve aerobic and anaerobic power and performance [R, R]. Only a 2% loss in fluids can result in as much as a 20% decrease in exercise performance. GlycerPump™ Vs Other Forms Of Glycerol We chose the trademarked GlycerPump because it doesn’t clump up nearly as much as other forms of Glycerol powder and it’s more stable. Glycerol is normally a liquid at standard temperature and pressure, and many supplement companies have attempted to create a powder form of Glycerol that is stable. Glycerol products get clumpy, have horrible viscosity and have a short shelf life. Because of this, most companies avoid this ingredient entirely, as it can cause severe clumping within just a couple months of being manufactured. Regular glycerol containing products only yield as low as 10% glycerol, which makes them ineffective, and higher yielding glycerol products can be unstable within complex formulas like ours and result in a clumpy product, or complete product failure. GlycerPump™ is created using unique spray drying technology, yielding a stable powder form of glycerol standardized to 65%. It is MUCH better than other alternatives and won't result in the powder turning into a rock. Keep in mind, while it is manageable, this is not a clump-free product, and there’s nothing I could do about that if I wanted to include the high concentration of ingredients that I did in Gorilla Mode Nitric. Store Gorilla Mode Nitric in a cool dry place, and if it clumps, that’s just what comes with the territory with a product dosed like this. If it clumps, just get out a knife or spoon and chop it up, and it will still mix fine once it hits the water in your cup. Agmatine Sulfate – 1500 mg Agmatine has shown to induce NO production more effectively than Arginine [R]. Agmatine has also shown to be neuroprotective against excitotoxicity and stroke, and also has anti-anxiety and anti-depressant effects that may enhance state of well-being and mood elevation with supplementation. Agmatine has also shown to manipulate pain receptors, which may result in an increased pain tolerance during intense training. Agmatine is a very misunderstood compound and is believed by some to antagonize other vasodilators. Agmatine works in a more selective way than other vasodilators, as it only increases one of the three Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms. It also decreases the other two NOS isoforms, which is where the hypothesis about it being vasoconstricting was raised as a concern. The three NOS isoforms include iNOS, nNOS and eNOS. They each play their own role in certain tissues to regulate vasodilation.  iNOS (inducible) produces high concentrations of NO via an immune system response to kill harmful bacteria. In excess, iNOS can be inflammatory. nNOS (neuronal) regulates neurological health and facilitates communication in the brain across neurons. In excess, nNOS can inhibit the growth and repair of neurons. eNOS (endothelial) facilitates vasodilation in the lining of blood vessels to improve blood flow.  eNOS is the main isoform that most are familiar with that increases blood flow and lowers blood pressure. It is also the main isoform that facilitates massive pumps in the gym. While NO is great for the gym and vascular health, it can be inflammatory in excess. NO production by eNOS has shown to play a protective role in cerebral ischemia by maintaining vascular permeability, whereas NO derived from nNOS and iNOS is neurotoxic and can enhance the neuronal damage occurring in ischemia [R]. This is where the selective activity of Agmatine shines, as data suggests that Agmatine's mechanism of action is facilitated by inhibiting iNOS and nNOS and increasing eNOS [R, R]. Agmatine has shown to selectively increase eNOS levels while simultaneously decreasing iNOS and MMP-9 protein expression [R, R]. Data suggests that Agmatine may also be an inhibitor of the enzyme Arginase [R]. Arginase inhibits the production of NO through several mechanisms, but mainly by competing with NO synthase (NOS) for the substrate Arginine and uncoupling of NOS [R]. Thus, the inhibition of Arginase can effectively enhance the amount of NO produced through a different vector than most NO precursors upstream.  Anecdotally, Agmatine does not seem to inhibit any of the positive effects of L-Citrulline or other vasodilators. On the contrary, it seems to complement other “pump” compounds very effectively. On paper, Agmatine sounds like the perfect ancillary compound to add to a pre-workout as it increases expression of the NOS isoform we want, while simultaneously inhibiting the isoforms that can be more inflammatory in excess. Nitrosigine® (inositol-stabilized arginine silicate) – 1500 mg Nitrosigine got some hype behind it when independent researchers from the University of Arkansas presented data suggesting that 1500 mg of Nitrosigine was almost as effective as 8000 mg of Citrulline Malate 2:1 (5333.33 mg L-Citrulline and 2666.66 mg Malic Acid) at increasing flow mediated dilation (FMD) [R]. FMD refers to dilation of an artery when blood flow increases in that artery. Because the primary cause of FMD is release of nitric oxide by endothelial cells, we can use FMD as a proxy for NO levels. To circumvent the lackluster efficacy of plain oral Arginine, Nutrition 21 (the developers of Nitrosigine) created a complex of bonded arginine and silicon. The inositol acts as a stabilizer and increases the bioavailability of the complex, consequently resulting in a potent NO boosting compound. Remember that the main issue with Arginine is poor bioavailability. The inositol stabilizer helps circumvent that issue [R]. Unlike plain Arginine, Inositol-stabilized Arginine silicate (Nitrosigine) has shown to kick in within 15 minutes and elevate blood Arginine levels for up to six hours after ingestion [R, R]. Nitrosigine has some impressive data reinforcing its efficacy, and it is purported to be much more effective milligram for milligram than other common vasodilators at increasing NO levels. On top of the increase in vasodilation and pumps, the developers claim that after a single dose Nitrosigine can increase mental acuity and focus by 33% within 15 minutes, with a compounding effect over time. In addition, they claim that Nitrosigine supports enhanced recovery by reducing markers of muscle damage [R].  Nitrosigine Vs. L-Citrulline Vs. Agmatine Sulfate In Vitro An in vitro study was designed by Nutrition 21 to compare the cellular production of NO of several sports nutrition ingredients. These ingredients included Nitrosigine, L-Arginine, L-Arginine AKG, L-Citrulline, Citrulline Malate and Agmatine Sulfate. Nitrosigine was dosed at a concentration of 1.0 g/L. Cell culture concentrations of the other compounds were dosed relative to a 1500 mg dose of Nitrosigine using the following doses:  L-Arginine – 1500 mg L-Arginine AKG – 4000 mg L-Citrulline – 3000 mg L-Citrulline Malate – 3000 mg Agmatine Sulfate – 1000 mg  As NO is unstable and rapidly converts to nitrites or nitrates, nitrite levels were measured as a proxy for NO production. At the doses used in this study, Nitrosigine significantly increased NO production over each of the five other compounds tested. There was a greater than 5X increase in NO production with Nitrosigine compared to the other tested vasodilators. In addition, of the compounds tested, only Nitrosigine significantly increased NO production versus control.  While this looks very impressive for Nitrosigine, you have to consider that this is an in vitro study conducted by Nutrition 21 themselves. The results basically indicate that every single clinically proven vasodilator that we know works is useless as it couldn't increase NO production above control, meanwhile Nitrosigine somehow cranked it through the roof over 5x higher than the rest. While the results are certainly interesting, I would take this data with a grain of salt. Nitrosigine Vs. Citrulline Malate – Vasodilation Study On Young Adults Unlike the in vitro study comparing Nitrosigine to Citrulline Malate, another study in 2019 was apparently conducted independently from the company without their knowledge whatsoever [R]. This study was conducted on young, healthy, physically active adults, and provides more acceptable parameters for us to take seriously when it comes to evaluating Nitrosigine's efficacy in humans relative to a decent dose of the most widely used vasodilator in the industry, Citrulline Malate (assuming that the study was actually unbiased as is implied) [R]. 16 healthy young men and 8 healthy young women participated in the study. Each subject either received 1500 mg of Nitrosigine, 8000 mg of Citrulline Malate 2:1, or dextrose placebo. Keep in mind, this is Citrulline Malate 2:1, so the subjects are only actually getting 5333.33 mg of L-Citrulline. The study was randomized, double-blind, within-subjects design where participants reported for three trials, each preceded by a 7-day washout period. Baseline flow mediated dilation (FMD) measurement was obtained for each visit, followed by consumption of one clinical dose Citrulline Malate (8 grams), Nitrosigine (1.5 grams), or dextrose placebo (8 g). Following a 60-min digestion period, FMD was repeated.  Supplementation order was randomized controlling for potential order effects. Basically, the subjects would show up, get their FMD evaluated, take one of the three options, and then get their FMD checked again to see how well the random compound they ingested increased their NO production. They would then take a week off, and come back and repeat, where they would then receive one of the remaining two compounds, with the same measurement process. This would be followed by another week off, and then a third visit where the subjects would receive whatever the third ingredient was that they hadn't yet tried, and the same measurement process was conducted. Nobody knew what they were ingesting during each trip, but by the end of the experiment every single subject had tried each ingredient, and their vasodilation response was evaluated for comparisons. Expectedly, Citrulline Malate and Nitrosigine yielded a greater improvement in FMD response than placebo.    Citrulline Malate increased FMD by 34%. Nitrosigine increased FMD by 31%. Placebo decreased FMD by 2%. Allometric scaling of the FMD values was required afterwards to adjust the results to account for the body size of males relative to females. After allometric scaling of the FMD values, Citrulline Malate was shown to increase FMD by 25%, Nitrosigine increased FMD by 23%, and placebo increased FMD by 0.6%.  Clearly Citrulline Malate isn't as useless as the Nutrition 21 funded in vitro data would lead you to believe. The results from this study suggest that the clinically efficacious 1500 mg dose of Nitrosigine is almost equally effective to 5333.33 mg of L-Citrulline mixed with 2666.66 mg of Malic Acid. Clearly Nitrosigine has a lot of promise as a pre-workout ingredient, which is why I included it in our formula alongside the massive dosages of other potent vasodilators we already have. Every single effective vasodilator we felt was worthwhile is in here at topped out dosages. While it would be nice if there was data we could refer to evaluating if there is a synergy between Nitrosigine and Citrulline, or Nitrosigine and Agmatine, regardless if the end result is 1+1 = 2 or if it's 1+1 = 3, my goal was to make sure this formula was air tight and ensure you are getting the maximum possible performance enhancing benefit from each and every ingredient.    Sodium Nitrate – 1500 mg Sodium is one of the most critical and overlooked components of a diet designed to optimize exercise performance. But, keep in mind, you’re not going to get enough sodium in a pre-workout without it tasting terrible. Other companies will put a tiny dose of sodium in their product and then claim you will get all of the benefits of it. Personally, I just toss and wash a quarter teaspoon of a high quality salt 30 minutes pre-workout with Gorilla Mode or Gorilla Mode Nitric, and I take another quarter teaspoon with my post-workout drink. The reason I included sodium nitrate in Gorilla Mode Nitric is not for the sodium, it is for the nitrates. The nitrate–nitrite–nitric oxide (NO) pathway is a series of oxygen-independent and NO synthase–independent single-electron transfer reactions that ultimately facilitate vasodilation. The traditional Arginine–eNOS–nitric oxide (NO) pathway is what most NO precursors focus on. The nitrate–nitrite–nitric oxide (NO) pathway often goes completely neglected though, and is another pathway we can leverage to amplify NO levels to an even greater level. Nitrates found in food can be converted into nitrites in the body, and then reduced to NO via nitrite reductase [R]. Several studies have shown that nitrate supplementation can increase plasma nitrite concentrations, and consequently Nitric Oxide, which then enhances pumps, endurance, and all of the other benefits we use NO precursors for [R].  Nitrate Dosage – Sodium Nitrate Vs. Beet Root Powder Pre-Workouts Beet root is a very popular ingredient that has started to get a lot of attention over the past few years. The reason why beet root works is because it is a densely concentrated source of nitrates. However, despite it being densely concentrated relative to other foods, beet root still only contains 1-2 percent of nitrates per gram of raw material. This would require you to ingest an absurdly high amount of beet root to get the same amount of nitrates that you can get from the 1500 mg of sodium nitrate in Gorilla Mode Nitric. To put it in perspective, your standard beet root powder pre-workout supplement has around 4.3 grams of Beet root juice powder in it.  The amount of nitrates in that 4.3 grams is about 43 mg. That means that you would need to chug the entire tub at one time to get the same amount of nitrate as you would get out of a 1500 mg dose of sodium nitrate. There is no feasible way to get a high dose of nitrates from beet root powder without ingesting massive quantities far higher than what you would get in a dietary supplement. By weight, sodium nitrate is the most highly concentrated source of nitrates among any dietary ingredient. Nitrates comprise 73 percent of the total weight of sodium nitrate [R]. The optimal dosage of nitrate supplementation appears to be between 6.4-12.8 mg/kg [R]. That equates to the following dosage protocols:  440-870 mg for a 150 lb person 580-1,160 mg for a 200 lb person 730-1,450 mg for a 250 lb person  For every gram of sodium nitrate, 730 mg is from nitrate. The 1.5 grams of sodium nitrate in Gorilla Mode Nitric yields 1095 mg of nitrate. There are other nitrate based supplements in the industry like Arginine Nitrate, Creatine Nitrate, Betaine Nitrate that operate via this same nitrate–nitrite–nitric oxide (NO) pathway, however, none of them have as high of a nitrate composition gram for gram as Sodium Nitrate does. VasoDrive-AP® (isoleucyl-prolyl-proline (IPP) and valyl-prolyl-proline (VPP) isolated from hydrolyzed milk casein) – 254 mg VasoDrive-AP consists of 2 lactotripeptides: isoleucyl-prolyl-proline (IPP) and valyl-prolyl-proline (VPP) which are clinically proven to inhibit Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and significantly increases vasodilation.  Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) controls blood pressure by regulating the volume of fluids in the body. ACE facilitates this process by converting the hormone angiotensin I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) inhibit ACE, consequently reducing angiotensin II production. Reducing angiotensin II results in the dilation of blood vessels and a reduction of blood pressure. Bradykinin is also a vasodilator in the body that is degraded by ACE. Clinical data suggests that individuals who genetically have lower levels of ACE respond better to training and are at an advantage in endurance sporting events [R, R]. The more blood flow you have, presumably the more oxygen and nutrient carrying capacity you will have during exercise. VasoDrive-AP has shown in 30 clinical studies to date a potent effect on vasodilation and blood pressure reduction via this mechanism completely independent from the traditional Arginine–eNOS–nitric oxide (NO) pathway [R].  Ingredients I Didn’t Include In The Formula And Why Vitamin C Vitamin C is a very potent antioxidant and plays a crucial role in lowering blood pressure and regulating health blood flow. Supplementing a Vitamin C deficient diet can be very beneficial, except when you're dosing it pre-workout. Vitamin C is inexpensive and has tons of clinical data to back its efficacy, so it is often thrown in pre-workouts. The problem with this is that using Vitamin C pre-workout can blunt the hormetic response to the workout itself and hinder your results [R]. The point of working out is to damage the muscle, which then results in the body signaling repair processes to start that will help you recover and ultimately get bigger and stronger to adapt to the workload. If you manually decrease that hormetic response to exercise by ingesting Vitamin C pre-workout, you will reduce the damage done and ultimately prevent your body from stimulating as much growth. Personally, I don't take any vitamins, anti inflammatories, or powerful antioxidants for several hours before or after my workout to be safe. Antioxidants And Vitamins As mentioned, one of the worst things you can do is take antioxidants before your workout. The stress and damage induced by weightlifting or exercise is needed to facilitate muscular recovery and progress. The reactive oxygen species and inflammation produced during intense training assists with that process, and is also why drugs like Ibuprofen can inhibit muscle growth so severely. The inflammatory response to training is what we want in order to recover, and by inhibiting that with antioxidants, vitamins or anti-inflammatory drugs, you prevent your body from breaking down and recovering the way it needs to in order to grow [R, R]. A pre-workout formula with a bunch of vitamins and antioxidants in it is more likely to hinder your gains than help. Potassium I advise reaching your recommended daily intake of 4,700 mg through diet rather than through supplementation. It is not legal to sell Potassium in high amounts, and you will usually find that supplements have no more than 100 mg or so per serving because of this. For this same reason, supplementation isn't cost effective, and pre-workouts with potassium in them are including it solely to claim the benefits of potassium all the while knowing the dose in their product is next to useless. The amount of potassium in pre-workout supplements does next to nothing for you when it comes to helping you hit the RDA. S7™ S7™ is a blend of green coffee bean extract, green tea extract, turmeric extract, tart cherry, blueberry, broccoli and kale that has gotten some hype in pre-workouts recently. I was considering including it in our formula until I saw that the blend was comprised entirely of potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. Turmeric is one of the most potent anti-inflammatory spices known to man, which is why it also shows such therapeutic promise via supplementation. However, the last thing you want to use pre-workout is a potent anti-inflammatory compound. Inflammation is what we are striving for during a workout, and using anything that significantly impairs this inflammatory response to training is something that should not be used pre-workout, and should be saved for taking far away from the peri-workout window. Beta Alanine Beta Alanine is the ingredient that makes your skin itchy and has you sitting there scratching your face between sets. I assume it is included in pre-workouts because you can blatantly feel something when you take it, so people associate feeling something with the product being potent. Personally, I can’t stand the itchy skin effect it has, and it can be bad enough that it ruins a pre-workout just based on that. In addition, it doesn’t have more than a negligible effect on performance at best. Acute sporadic bumps in Beta Alanine will do next to nothing if you are only getting your Beta Alanine dosage from your pre workout supplement a few times per week. If you were to take it correctly, dosing it multiple times per day, for weeks on end, at a high enough dosage, the impact on performance is notable, although still fairly insignificant at the end of the day. “The median effect of β-alanine supplementation is a 2.85% (-0.37 to 10.49%) improvement in the outcome of an exercise measure, when a median total of 179 g of β-alanine is supplemented” [R]. 179 grams (an amount nobody would end up getting in) for a 2.85% improvement in performance, and a ton of itchiness… “Although some laboratory-based studies show an ergogenic effect with beta-alanine supplementation, there is a lack of field-based research in training and competition settings.” “There was an unclear effect (0.4%; ± 0.8%, mean, ± 90% confidence limits) of beta-alanine on competition performance compared to placebo with no meaningful changes in blood chemistry. While there was a transient improvement on training performance after 4 weeks with beta-alanine (-1.3%; ± 1.0%), there was an unclear effect at ten weeks (-0.2%; ± 1.5%) and no meaningful changes in blood chemistry. Beta-alanine supplementation appears to have minimal effect on swimming performance in non-laboratory controlled real-world training and competition settings” [R]. Leucine Taking Leucine post-workout promotes muscle growth. However, taking Leucine in your pre-workout has shown to diminish muscular performance via the inhibition of glycogen to glucose conversion within muscle cells and insulin signaling. On top of that, Leucine can prevent the uptake of Tyrosine into the brain, consequently inhibiting dopamine production, which is the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish pre-workout. Should You Ever Cycle Off Of Gorilla Mode Nitric? Despite Nitric being stimulant free, I would still advise cycling your use of Gorilla Mode Nitric every once in a while. In general, I advise cycling your use of any supplement that isn't being used daily to replace a dietary deficiency. Interfering with balancing mechanisms in the body chronically long-term is almost always going to build up to some unintended negative side effect, and redlining your Nitric Oxide levels and vasodilation on a daily basis for long uninterrupted spans of time will probably be no different. How often you cycle it is ultimately up to your discretion as there is no tolerance build up with the ingredients in Nitric, and some of them actually have accumulative benefits. Personally, I use pre-workouts 4 days per week because I workout 4 times per week. Every month or two I will also take a full week off of everything except for my daily health supplements. How To Combine Gorilla Mode Nitric With Gorilla Mind Rush Gorilla Mode Nitric has no stimulants in it, so if you want the most potent combination of performance, energy, focus and drive pre-workout you can combine Nitric with Gorilla Mind Rush. Dose each product as you would normally dose them on their own, as there is no overlap between the two formulas. How To Combine Gorilla Mode Nitric With Gorilla Mode Gorilla Mode can be combined with Gorilla Mode Nitric to achieve a more middle road level of stimulants but with the maxed out vasodilation and hyper-hydration. The instance in which mixing the two would make the most sense is if you don't want to use a high dose of Gorilla Mode because the stimulant dosages are higher than you prefer or can tolerate, but still want to max out the benefits of the ingredients included for pump and performance. For example, if 2 scoops of Gorilla Mode contains too high of a dose of stimulants for you, you could use 1 scoop of Gorilla Mode with 1 scoop of Gorilla Mode Nitric. Or, a 1/2 scoop of Gorilla Mode with 1.5 scoops of Gorilla Mode Nitric. Alternatively, if you are using Nitric and want a little bump of stimulants but are too sensitive to the stimulant complex in Gorilla Mind Rush, then you might want to add a bit of Gorilla Mode to your Nitric dose as the blend of stimulants in Mode is a notch less aggressive than the stimulants in Rush. Mix and match at your own discretion based on your own stimulant tolerance and exactly what you are looking to get out of your pre-workout. Personally, I love combining Rush and Nitric pre-workout. Sometimes I will use Mode with Nitric instead though as the Kanna and N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate hits differently than the stimulants in Rush. It all depends on what I'm training, how well rested I am, and the effects I am shooting for. Conclusion – What To Expect From Gorilla Mode Nitric In general, you can expect a massive increase in nitric oxide (NO) levels, vasodilation, intracellular hydration and as significant of a boost in muscle strength and endurance as you can get from a legal non-hormonal pre-workout. This product is maxed out from all angles. The traditional Arginine–eNOS–nitric oxide (NO) pathway is completely saturated with an unheard of dose of L-Citrulline, as well as topped out dosages of Nitrosigine and Agmatine Sulfate for good measure. Over a gram of nitrates also ensures that the nitrate–nitrite–nitric oxide (NO) pathway is taken care of. Intracellular hyper-hydration is best-in-class too with a huge dose of Creatine Monohydrate, Glycerpump and Betaine Anhydrous to volumize the muscle and support performance and pumps. Inhibiting the enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with a clinical dose of VasoDrive-AP® also checks off another pathway to push the boundaries on supraphysiological levels of vasodilation.  Finally, a high dose of Malic Acid was included for good measure to act as a Krebs cycle intermediary and support greater levels of muscular endurance.

    "content": "How Different Anabolic Steroids Can Affect Your Immune System And Vulnerability To Viral Infections     Both Testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) adversely influence the immune system, affecting leucocyte growth or activity, and antibody and cytokine production, particularly when used at supraphysiological doses, mimicking a condition of secondary immunodeficiency [R, R]. Secondary immunodeficiency, much more common than primary immunodeficiency (that is to say those caused by genetic defects affecting the cells of the immune system), is characterized by various factors that affect a normal immune system, including infectious, iatrogenic, metabolic and environmental factors. These immune deficiencies are manifested clinically with an increased frequency or unusual complications of common infections and occasionally with the onset of opportunistic pathogen infections.   Table of Contents ToggleNandrolone And Anadrol Effects On The Immune SystemWinstrol And Trenbolone Effects On The Immune SystemTestosterone, Teslac, Anavar And Winstrol Effects On The Immune SystemHow Steroids Influence Immune FunctionAre You Increasing Your Risk Of Viral Infection When You Are On Cycle? Nandrolone And Anadrol Effects On The Immune System Nandrolone Decanoate and Anadrol directly induce the production of inflammatory cytokines Interleukin 1 Beta (IL-1β) and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) in human peripheral blood leukocyte cultures [R]. Testosterone and DHEA had no direct cytokine inducing effect in the same model. Nandrolone Decanoate also inhibits interferon production in NDV-infected mouse L-929 and human WISH cells.  Winstrol And Trenbolone Effects On The Immune System Winstrol and Trenbolone were found to be genotoxic and cytotoxic to human lymphocytes in a dose dependent manner [R].  Testosterone, Teslac, Anavar And Winstrol Effects On The Immune System To evaluate how anabolic steroids affect the immune system, five commercially available steroids with various types of structural differences were studied in a rodent model [R]. Animals were divided into five groups and treated with Testosterone (group 1), Testosterone Propionate (Group 2), the steroidal aromatase inhibitor Testolactone (Teslac) (Group 3), Anavar (Group 4), and Winstrol (Group 5). Significant immunosuppression was observed with all groups. However, by day 10, the Teslac, Anavar and Winstrol treated group showed immunostimulation and actually exceeded baseline immunity while the Testosterone treated groups maintained immunosuppressed.  To truly test the effects of endogenous androgens on the immune system a second experiment was then performed. Ten animals maintained in a similar manner to the initial experiment were either treated intact or were castrated and then treated for 8 days, with Anavar (1.1 mg/kg/day), Testosterone (1.1 mg/kg/day) or Anavar combined with physiologic amounts of Testosterone (15 μg/day). Anavar was selected because it has the greatest anabolic activity of all Testosterone analogues as compared to Testosterone (androgenic/anabolic activity = 1:13). In the intact animals after 8 days of treatment with Anavar, serum Testosterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay on tail vein blood. Levels were either undetectable or very low, reflecting what would be significant HPTA suppression. Immune function (DCH responses) measured at the same time revealed a 41% increase over baseline. The Testosterone treated group experienced a 36% suppression of immune function. Further treatment for 8 days with Anavar combined with physiologic amounts of Testosterone eliminated the immune system enhancement provided by Anavar monotherapy and returned the DCH responses to levels that were not significantly different from baseline.  The results were different in the castrated animals. Castration, resulted in an increase in immune (DCH) responses. The mean observed change was 90% greater than intact (pre-castration) baseline. That means that castrated rats had a 90% improvement above and beyond rats that weren’t castrated. Eight day administration of Anavar to these animals had an immunodepressive effect returning the DCH response to baseline. Eight day treatment with Anavar combined with physiologic doses of Testosterone produced an even greater suppression, 45% change from baseline.  These observations indicate that immune alterations do occur with anabolic steroids which are immunosuppressive when the steroid nucleus is intact and immunostimulatory with nuclear alterations. How Steroids Influence Immune Function The hypothesis to explain the immune system responses to steroids is as follows.  Exogenous androgenic anabolic steroids produce two effects on the immune system: (A) a direct early effect on immune function which is suppressive and, (B) an indirect delayed stimulatory effect mediated through the negative feedback on the pituitary. (B) results in inhibition of gonadal Testosterone through diminished LH release. A decrease in the synthesis of Testosterone results in low serum Testosterone level and immune stimulation. Castration, by abolishing the modulation of Testosterone secretion eliminates the effect of (B) but leaves (A) intact. In summation, the more suppressive a steroid is the more it can indirectly enhance immune function, simply by suppressing the endogenous production of Testosterone and its metabolites. However, anabolic steroids will also be genotoxic and cytotoxic to human lymphocytes in a dose dependent manner. So, the only reason anabolic steroids can enhance immunity is by being more tissue selective than Testosterone and by shutting down the HPTA, not by inherently being protective. They too will be inherently immunosuppressive, just to a lesser degree based on their tissue selectivity and magnitude of impact on endogenous androgen production suppression. At the end of the day, the data all suggests that the lower your levels of steroids are in the body, the higher level your immune system will function at in parallel. Are You Increasing Your Risk Of Viral Infection When You Are On Cycle? In summary, the vast majority of studies suggest that steroid use decreases antibody formation, Natural Killer (NK) lymphocyte activity, T and B lymphocyte maturation and stimulation resulting in immunosuppression [R]. Supraphysiological doses of common anabolic steroids have been shown to directly influence the production of certain cytokines, altering immune function. The results from both animal and human studies suggest that supraphysiological doses of AAS can negatively impact the immune system. The takeaway from all of this is that with an easily spread virus infecting thousands of people throughout the world right now, it would be prudent to reduce your exogenous AAS use at least down to therapeutic levels to support immune function during this time where having increased vulnerability to viral infection is the most risky. Regardless if you are young and believe you are invincible based on the mortality rate statistics showing that the elderly are the most at risk of being symptomatic or ending up in critical condition, you may still be increasing your chances of becoming an infected carrier who then transmits the virus to the elderly (including your parents or grandparents) as a result of self-induced immunosuppression.

    "content": "Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Steroid Cycle – Dbol And Primobolan     Arnold Schwarzenegger's steroid cycle from the golden era of bodybuilding is a topic that is often heavily debated. There's a lot of speculation around what kind of drug use the golden era bodybuilders deployed to get the physiques that are so sought after nowadays. While Arnold himself never detailed exactly what he took, we have a handful of credible sources of information that all seem to overlap in their descriptions of his steroid use. Despite this information being very accessible, it often goes overlooked because it is buried in the nooks and crannies of the internet. There is such an overwhelming amount of content on the internet now that this information has become increasingly more difficult to find over the years. While Arnold likely experimented a bit here and there, this article will detail what he built his physique on, and the staple anabolics he very likely used throughout his Mr. Olympia reign.   Table of Contents ToggleArnold Schwarzenegger Briefly Touches On His First Steroid CycleArnold Schwarzenegger's Interview About Dianabol UseSteve Davis Outlines Golden Era Steroid CyclesRic Drasin Details Golden Era Steroid CyclesArnold Schwarzenegger’s Dosage Titration ProtocolFrank Zane's Semi-Cryptic Poem About Golden Era Steroid CyclesArnold Schwarzenegger’s Steroid Cycle Arnold Schwarzenegger Briefly Touches On His First Steroid Cycle In Arnold Schwarzenegger's autobiography “Total Recall – My Unbelievably True Life Story” he gives some insight into what his first steroid cycle consisted of, and when he started it.  The first thing of note is that he discovered steroid use before the 1967 Mr. Universe competition while researching about the training methods of the East Germans and the Soviets. There were rumors that they were using performance enhancing drugs to get superior results from their weightlifters, shot-putters, and swimmers and he soon found out that steroids were the drugs that they were using.  Arnold goes on to touch on how he went to a doctor to ask for a prescription of anabolic steroids. He simply asked: Can you let me try it? The doctor agreed, and he was then prescribed an injection every two weeks and pills to take in between.  Keep in mind, this was Arnold's first steroid cycle ever. His dosages may have titrated up in subsequent cycles, and he probably experimented with different anabolics at some point at least once or twice. The more muscle you gain, the higher your requirements will become for increasingly high amounts of calories, training volume, and drug use to support additional hypertrophy above and beyond what you have already achieved. While Arnold didn't state exactly what he was prescribed, we get some useful insight into the administration practice of each compound (oral and injectable) and what type of drugs would probably fall into these two categories at that time when considering all of the other information from other interviews we have compiled over the years. At this point, we know he was using one injectable compound and one oral compound. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Interview About Dianabol Use In another interview Arnold more or less implies that he used 3 Dianabol per day. It is well-known in the community that Arnold was big on using Dianabol back in the day.  Obviously he's not actually straight up saying “this was what my cycle was”, but we can put two and two together based on his prescription for pills and an injection from a doctor, Arnold talking about Dianabol himself, and the widespread information that's passed through the grapevine reinforcing his Dianabol use. It all culminates to paint a pretty convincing picture that Dianabol was the oral steroid in question that Arnold used. What the injectable compound was is mainly what is debated about. After doing some digging, I uncovered some pretty convincing information suggesting that the injectable compound was Primobolan. Steve Davis Outlines Golden Era Steroid Cycles In 2012, Ric Drasin interviewed Steve Davis to discuss steroid cycles from the golden era. Both men trained at Gold's Gym with Arnold in the 70's and had personal insight into what golden era stacks consisted of, as they literally took the same stacks themselves. Steve Davis After prompting the topic of what golden era bodybuilders were using, Steve goes on to touch on what most guys were using: Steve: You know, in my era, it was 3 Dianabol a day and a shot a week. Ric: That's exactly right. Steve: And we heard that certain Austrians were taking 4 Dianabol a day and a shot a week. Ric: Yeah.  I'm sure both Steve and Ric actually had this conversation with Arnold at some point to confirm this, as they trained with him and bodybuilders were supposedly pretty open about their use back then. The standard protocol going around then was 3 Dianabol a day, and 1 shot of Primobolan per week. While some of the protocols definitely differed from person to person (e.g. Robby Robinson and Danny Padilla using Deca-only cycles), for the most part it seems like the majority of guys that trained with Arnold in Gold's Gym in the 70's were doing the same thing. Now, the question is are they underplaying their use to not undervalue their training intensity and diet adherence? Perhaps. It is very common for “open” individuals to talk about their steroid use, but basically just cut what their dosages are in half when speaking about what they took. Ric Drasin Details Golden Era Steroid Cycles In 2018 Ric Drasin circles back to the topic of golden era steroid cycles and outlines more specifics about what steroids the top bodybuilders from Gold's Gym were using in the 70's.  Now I was there at that time, so I know exactly what everybody took. Without using names of people because I don't want to implicate anybody, but starting with the top bodybuilders, and some that you know, it wasn't that much use of steroids the way we think of today. Basically, it was Dianabol, Primobolan, Testosterone, Deca, Winstrol, and Anavar. Those are the main ones. There wasn't anything outside of that. Growth Hormone wasn't really known about then, so nobody really used it. I mean, maybe it was in some circles, but we sure didn't hear about it. Mostly tablets. The injectables were the ones I mentioned. The Winstrol, the Dianabol, and the Anavar were strictly tablets, there was no injectable at all of that sort. Dianabol was made by CIBA (C-I-B-A). It was a little blue pill. Came in 100 a bottle. If you bought it at the pharmacy, it was a prescription, it was $8 a bottle. Deca was $1.50 a vial, that's it. Testosterone. Let's say, 10 CCs of an enanthate was 10 bucks. Anavar, around the same price and down the line, nothing was really expensive. Now, you have to realize back in '69 and the 70's, steroids were not illegal. They were never looked upon as being illegal. There was a doctor's prescription. You could get it pretty easily if you needed it, and then you had it. There were those doctors that were affiliated with Gold's Gym back in those days that would just hand it to you. One was a pediatrician who was well-known. The other one was a medical doctor, who was well-known. If you needed something, you got it. Now, from the top of the line bodybuilders, the ones that were competing in the Olympia back then, from Gold's, their main routine was taking Primobolan, Winstrol, and Deca. Forgot to mention Deca. And not in any great usage. It was like a “CC” of each, maybe once to twice a week. That was it. People seem to think that some of these guys were taking like “10 CCs” a day, every day. I never saw it happen. No way in hell that ever happened. Dianabol, no more than three to four pills a day, at most. Anavar was weak, so six to eight pills a day. Winstrol was four pills a day. Now, I started on Dianabol back in the, maybe, late 60's. I had heard about Bill Pearl taking it. I got it from a pharmacy, CIBA, and I started doing two pills a day. By 10 days in, I had grown so much, it was ridiculous. This is when everything was real. I really grew from that Dbol and they quit making it way back. Maybe, the mid 80's. CIBA just went out of business and that was it. It became illegal. They said on the bottles themselves that these drugs would not enhance athletic performance. They had to label that on there. And, then they took it off of there. Primobolan coming from Germany, or Austria I might say, was probably one of the best things I ever tried. It was given to me by “one of our big bodybuilders” at the time. I had great results off that. I got so huge in two weeks, I could hardly fit into my Volkswagen. And I'm not kidding. That's how big I got just off that and the Dbol. I never took great amounts. 1 shot a week, 3 Dbol a day, maybe 2 Dbol a day. So, when you asked what these guys took, and how much did they take, and “did they take a lot?” No, it wasn't a lot at all. And I always felt that “less was more.” You didn't need a whole lot to get big. If you took too much, it didn't really work that well. It wasn't any better than taking less. It was available pretty easy. Like I said, it wasn't illegal. Everybody had it. And that's how it was. But most of the results in training came from heavy-lifting old school style, and a lot of protein.  One of the “big bodybuilders” gave Ric Primobolan for the first time, and he was following the classic dosing protocol we've seen mentioned time and time again now. A few Dbol per day, and a shot of Primo per week. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Dosage Titration Protocol A credible guru in the industry details what is purported to be Arnold's dosage titration protocol at the 37:18 mark in the following video:  Arnold took Dianabol and Primobolan, essentially nothing else. An escalating dose, kind of culminating in about 100 milligrams of Dianabol a day and about 1000 milligrams Primobolan a week, a.k.a. about two total grams of drug and that was it. No aromatase inhibitor, no Tamoxifen, no Insulin or Growth Hormone, just two grams of high-quality anabolic. By the way, you didn't hear mentioned any Testosterone. Testosterone really didn't come onto the scene 'til the late 70's, early 80s'. I have no idea how factual that purported titration schedule was, but it still reinforces the likelihood that Arnold's steroids of choice were Dbol and Primobolan. Frank Zane's Semi-Cryptic Poem About Golden Era Steroid Cycles The nail in the coffin in my opinion is Frank Zane's poem. In Frank Zane's “Mind, Body, Spirit” training diary, one Reddit user actually found a poem that essentially breaks down in code what the top bodybuilders took in the golden era.  Diana Bowl and Louie. Prima bowl on TV, both of whom worked as a team. Known for miles around as the best bowlers in town, Primo drove 100 miles a week combining 15 milly Gramola bars daily from Diana not worried about getting fat, you cannot not on that in those days. But that was then, this is now a growing cast of actors shove, share center stage all playing the same part at the same time I awoke amazed, wondering how this ridiculous play isn't dying by now. Obviously, anyone can see plain as day he's trying to allude to certain things in code here to outline what drugs guys were taking back then, as well as what appears to be his perspective on modern day bodybuilding as a whole compared to the golden era. The first thing, “Diana Bowl.” Obviously, that's Dianabol. “Prima bowl on.” Primobolan. “Primo drove 100 miles a week.” 100 milligrams per week of Primobolan, which reinforces the one shot a week of Primobolan that Arnold supposedly got. “Combining 15 milly Gramola bars daily from Diana” 15 milligrams per day of Dianabol (Dbol) combined with the weekly shot of Primo. After the part where he talks about 100 milligrams of Primo per week and the 15 milligrams of Dianabol per day he says: “But that was then, this is now. A growing cast of actors shove, share center stage. All playing the same part at the same time. I awoke amazed, wondering how this ridiculous play isn't dying by now.” I assume this part refers to his perspective of modern day bodybuilding compared to the golden era and how this generation abuses high dosages of multiple drugs, and how much of a travesty he believes bodybuilding has become. I believe it more or less stands for everything wrong with modern-day bodybuilding. The excessive mass chasing, the insane dosages of drugs, and him being amazed the “play isn't dying by now” perhaps alluding to the fact that bodybuilding has continued to remain popular despite an increasing amount of young bodybuilders dropping dead from drug abuse. There's a lot to take in from that poem. Dianabol (Dbol) And Primobolan Dosages Ric Drasin and Frank Zane both trained with Arnold and seem to be credible sources of information. Frank Zane is a Mr. Olympia winner himself and would know better than anyone what others from Gold's Gym were using. The cumulative evidence strongly suggests that Arnold was at minimum using a shot of Primobolan per week and 3-4 Dianabol per day. It is entirely possible that those dosages titrated up over the years, but in general we at least know that those were likely the compounds he used to build his physique. CIBA Dianabol was prescribed in 2.5 and 5 milligram oral tablets.  All forms of Bayer Primobolan Depot were packaged in one milliliter glass ampules and contained 100 milligrams of Metenolone Enanthate.  Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Steroid Cycle Based on the information provided, we can assume that Arnold Schwarzenegger’s steroid cycle consisted of 15-20 milligrams of Dianabol per day and 100 milligrams of Primobolan per week. Those are very conservative dosages by today's standards, and this was reinforced by every one in the golden era who has spoke out about the steroid use in that tight knit circle of bodybuilders Arnold hung out with. Obviously they could be wrong or lying, but I think their stories line up too well with each other for it to not be at least somewhat true. Hopefully that lays some myths to rest and sheds light on what the golden era bodybuilders were actually doing to achieve the physiques that everyone strives for nowadays. Nowadays, guys abuse excessive amounts of drugs in hopes of achieving golden era physiques, when the golden era guys were actually using a fraction of what teenage kids are cycling on nowadays. Granted, there may be a huge disparity in product quality between the pharmaceutical grade products available in the golden era compared to the UGL stuff most guys are using now. However, I do not believe that to be the case, with the exception of product purity and complete dosage accuracy. Most top UGL's are pretty on point and aren't far off of pharmaceutical quality, so to me that point usually just comes across as an excuse that guys use to justify using massive dosages, or for their lackluster results. The golden era steroid dosages were far more reasonable than most would otherwise believe had they not seen this stuff, or heard it straight from the horse's mouth. I don't think you will find a more credible resource than Arnold, Frank, Ric, and Steve themselves who have opened up about the standard dosages used in that era, with their statements all lining up with eachother.

    "content": "The Most Accurate Testosterone Blood Test You Can Get     Of the minority of men taking steroids who actually get blood tests, 99% of them get inaccurate assays. Most doctors don't realize the importance of high sensitivity testing when it comes to men in general, and even more so in steroid users. The difference between high sensitivity testing and what you have probably been getting in the past can be the entire reference range, or in some cases, it may even be detecting metabolites or analogs of other hormones. This is not limited to just testosterone either. Measuring Estradiol via Roche ECLIA (Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay) instead of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) has similar limitations, as do other hormone tests with insufficient analytical sensitivity.   Table of Contents ToggleThe Most Accurate Total Testosterone Blood TestThe Most Accurate Free Testosterone Blood TestMy Blood Test Results Comparing ECLIA And EIA Vs. LC/MS-MS And Equilibrium UltrafiltrationWhere To Order Accurate Blood Tests The Most Accurate Total Testosterone Blood Test The gold standard for accurately measuring total testosterone levels is high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). Recent studies have shown that the current assays used in total testosterone testing lack the required sensitivity to produce accurate results when working with very low concentrations. This can be especially problematic when trying to accurately measure total testosterone levels in severely testosterone deficient men, normal or testosterone deficient women, and children. In addition, these tests have proven via my own personal tests to detect synthetic anabolic androgenic steroids as testosterone. This issue can be corrected by newer methods based on mass spectrometry. The Most Accurate Free Testosterone Blood Test The gold standard for accurately measuring free testosterone levels is equilibrium dialysis. Equilibrium ultrafiltration is also sufficient. A comparison of results obtained via equilibrium dialysis and equilibrium ultrafiltration found that the two methods correlated closely (r = 0.97) [R]. Direct analog enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is inaccurate and has shown in my own personal tests to detect synthetic anabolic androgenic steroids as testosterone. My Blood Test Results Comparing ECLIA And EIA Vs. LC/MS-MS And Equilibrium Ultrafiltration This is an example that very clearly shows how important high sensitivity testing can be. I went in for a blood test during a Nandrolone-only experiment. I had no Testosterone in my system whatsoever. Expectedly, by assessing my Total Testosterone level via liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) and my Free Testosterone level via equilibrium ultrafiltration, we can see that my Testosterone levels were crashed. Both the total and the free were lower than a healthy female.  This is what you should see in your blood work if you’re on just Nandrolone. The only Testosterone being produced in my body was indirectly via the trace amounts of androgens produced in my adrenal cortex, which is why the value wasn't completely bottomed out at 0. I've mentioned many times the importance of getting high sensitivity testing done for hormone levels and how Nandrolone will register as Testosterone in primitive garbage blood tests. This is another great example of this. In addition to high sensitivity testing, I had the same blood tested using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) for my Total Testosterone level, and direct analog enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for my Free Testosterone level. These were the test results using the exact same blood sample with the terrible default assays that doctors will use to determine how to treat you, and that labs will give you in the majority of your blood work panels. According to ECLIA and EIA, I had a normal Total Testosterone and Free Testosterone level. This just one example of why getting accurate hormone testing is critical. My Testosterone levels were actually in the gutter, but ECLIA and EIA couldn't even tell the difference between Testosterone and 19-nortestosterone in my blood. Where To Order Accurate Blood Tests Most labs offer total testosterone (LC/MS-MS), and some offer free testosterone (equilibrium ultrafiltration). However, very few self-pay labs offer free testosterone (equilibrium dialysis). Of the ones that do offer it, it is extremely expensive and it does not come in a package with a total testosterone test. If your doctor will write you a requisition for it, great. If not, just get equilibrium ultrafiltration. Personally, I drive to the US just so I can get LC/MS-MS and equilibrium ultrafiltration testing done. This is the exact test I order every time to accurately check my testosterone levels: Testosterone, Free, Equilibrium Ultrafiltration With Total Testosterone, LC/MS-MS  Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

    "content": "The Most Effective GH Dose For Fat Loss Per Administration      Contrary to popular belief, more is not better when it comes to exogenous GH use for fat loss. There is a ceiling on lipolysis, and the highest GH dose for maximizing fat loss per administration is much lower than most people think.  As you can see here in the following study assessing the pharmacokinetics and acute lipolytic actions of GH, there were significant dose-response effects when comparing the incremental area under the curve of both free fatty acids and blood 3-hydroxy-butyrate following 0, 1, and 3 mcg/kg GH, whereas there were no differences between the responses following 3 and 6 mcg/kg GH [R].  These dosages were administered intravenously.  1 mg of Somatropin corresponds to 3 IU (International Units) of Somatropin [R].  So, this means that for someone who weighs 100 kg, lipolysis is maxed out at about 300 mcg of Somatropin, which is 0.9 IU’s of pharma grade GH IV.  We need to math out the corresponding subcutaneous dose based on the bioavailability and bioactivity comparison data we have on humans administered HGH.  Obviously IV dosages are not representative of what dosages would be via the far more realistic and tolerable method of administration (subcutaneous).  In one study, the mean estimated availability of subcutaneous injected HGH was shown to be 63% of that of HGH administered I.V. after correcting for differences in the GH dose [R]. Another study found the availability of subcutaneous injected HGH to be about 70% of that of HGH administered I.V. [R]. So, for a 100 kg man, fat loss benefits would be maxed out around 1.35 IU of GH per administration subcutaneously.  There is a refractory period cells need before another pulse of exogenous GH can even be useful in a lipolysis context, which I will delve into further in a future article.

    "content": "Will Taking GH Before Going To Sleep Suppress Your Natural Production Of GH?     At supraphysiological dosages, taking GH before going to sleep makes sense because there is a negative feedback loop on the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) axis. In this study, IGF-1 was constantly infused, and the effect on endogenous GH secretion was assessed [R]. Overall, GH concentrations were suppressed during the rhIGF-I infusion by 85±3%, mainly by attenuating spontaneous GH pulse amplitude (77±4% suppression). The apparent GH pulse frequency was attenuated from 7.8±0.9 to 4.7±0.6 pulses/24h (P= 0.006). IGF-1 is the primary feedback, and the mechanism is similar to what you see with the HPTA axis. When there is enough Testosterone and Estrogen, your body has this mechanism in place to prevent you from making more. The same thing happens with exogenous GH use. When you administer exogenous GH, IGF-1 elevates. When your body recognizes that IGF-1 is elevated, it starts to suppress GH pulse amplitude in a dose dependent manner.  If you are using supraphysiological amounts of GH for bodybuilding purposes, you can assume that your natural secretion is greatly inhibited during sleep as this negative feedback loop will prevent your body from secreting GH in your sleep like it normally would. When endogenous GH production is suppressed, administering exogenous GH at times that lipolysis or muscle growth can be optimized is the most logical approach to injection timing.  If fat loss is the goal, then taking GH in a fasted state prior to fasted cardio would be ideal. There is a ceiling on how much GH is needed to maximize lipolysis, so if your dosage exceeds 2 IU per day, then I would advise splitting up that dose into two (or more if needed) different periods of the day with as much time between them as possible. If muscle growth is the goal, GH should still be administered in a pulsatile fashion to mimic endogenous secretions. Topped out stimulation of autocrine IGF-1 in skeletal muscle can be achieved with fairly low dosages of exogenous GH, and administering a higher dose above and beyond that may just be a waste. This is why it would be wise to split up your daily GH dose into multiple administrations if you are using supraphysiological dosages.

As of now RU58841 is the most commonly used topical anti-androgen used for hair loss prevention, and Finasteride is the most commonly used 5α-Reductase inhibitor for hair loss prevention. Which is better for hair loss prevention? This is a common question I get asked and a dedicated post is long overdue.   Table of Contents ToggleStudy Comparing RU58841 Vs. Finasteride Head To HeadResultsSystemic EffectsMy Concluding Thoughts On This StudyAchieving Complete Hair Loss Protection By Addressing The Androgen Receptor, Not Just 5α-ReductaseWhich Is Better For Hair Loss Prevention?Where To Buy RU58841 Study Comparing RU58841 Vs. Finasteride Head To Head While there are tons of anecdotal reviews comparing Finasteride to RU58841, there is very little scientific data for us to refer to. There is some though that is worth delving into. In this study, Finasteride was stacked up against RU58841 to see which would be more effective for hair loss prevention, and how much each would impact systemic hormone levels [R]. RU58841 was applied either in a 5% solution, a 0.5% solution, or just a vehicle with no RU58841 in it for 6 months to the bald scalp of 10 stump-tailed macaques. The 5% solution was applied to 4 of the 10 bald stump-tailed macaques, the 0.5% solution was applied to 3 of the 10 bald stump-tailed macaques, and the vehicle with no RU58841 was applied to the last 3 of the 10 bald stump-tailed macaques. The common dosing protocol for RU58841 is typically a 5% solution applied to androgenic alopecia affected areas, so this study was right in line with what we would want to see. Oral Finasteride was given in a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 6 months to 10 bald stump-tailed macaques. An oral placebo was also given to 10 bald stump-tailed macaques. Male stump-tailed macaques weigh on average between 9.7–10.2 kg, so that would equate to a Finasteride dosage of roughly 10 mg orally per day. This dosage greatly exceeds the point of diminishing returns with Finasteride use, so this is also a great way for us to compare the efficacy of a standard dose of RU58841 to a maxed out dose of Finasteride. The stump-tailed macaque has shown to be a suitable biological model for human androgenetic alopecia as it possesses hereditary balding characteristics similar in many respects to that of androgenetic alopecia in humans [R]. Results Skin biopsies for micromorphometric analysis (folliculogram) were taken at 0 and 6 months for Finasteride treated macaques and at 0 and 4 months for RU58841 treated macaques. The amount of anagen follicles (hairs in the active growth phase) and vellus follicles (short, thin, and barely noticeable hairs) enlarged to terminal size were compared to those in pre-treatment stages. Anagen follicles increased an average of 88% with Finasteride. Anagen follicles increased an average of 103% with 5% strength RU58841. The growth of vellus follicles to terminal size (thick, strong, pigmented hairs that have fully matured) was 12% with Finasteride. The growth of vellus follicles to terminal size was 26% with 5% strength RU58841. The 0.5% strength RU58841 solution induced almost no effect. Expectedly, the Finasteride placebo induced no effect. The 5% strength RU58841 solution induced the most hair growth after only 2 months of treatment. RU58841 was given less time to work and still significantly outperformed Finasteride in this study. Although Finasteride significantly reduced DHT levels, DHT remaining and produced by Type I 5α-reductase isoenzyme still contributed to hair follicle miniaturization. Because Testosterone and DHT both bind to the androgen receptor, a locally sufficient dose of an “AR blocker” (topical anti-androgen) appears to suppress Testosterone and DHT induced follicular regression more effectively than 5α-reductase inhibition. Systemic Effects Plasma RU58841 and metabolites (10-20 ng/ml) were detected in 2 of the stump-tailed macaques that were applied the 5% strength RU58841 solution at the 3 month mark of treatment. Only 1 of the stump-tailed macaques had detectable plasma RU58841 and metabolites at at the 6 month mark of treatment. RU58841 had no significant impact on serum DHT or Testosterone levels at any point. Finasteride decreased serum DHT levels by about 70%, and Testosterone levels increased as a result of the 5α-reductase blockade. If Estrogen levels were assessed in the Finasteride treated group, their Estrogen levels would have showed significant elevation as well as a result of increased aromatization. My Concluding Thoughts On This Study This study shows that RU58841 can go systemic when topically applied, although there is no effect on endogenous androgen levels. First of all, I do believe that RU58841 can go systemic, in fact, I think it is an inevitable outcome. However, the degree to which it goes systemic and if the amount that goes systemic will cause anti-androgenic side effects will be based on several factors. These factors include but are not limited to endogenous androgen production, sex hormone metabolism, androgen receptor density and expression, scalp skin porosity, the dosage used, if there are open wounds on the scalp or not, the vehicle used, frequency of administration, and more. Does this ensure side effects? No. However, applying anything to your skin with a low enough molecular weight to be absorbed and not expecting it to go systemic at all is wishful thinking. The molecular weight of RU58841 is 369.34 g/mol [R]. 1 Da (dalton) = 1 g/mol. The molecular weight of a compound must be under 500 Dalton to allow skin absorption (which RU58841 is) [R]. With that being said, RU58841 is well tolerated by the majority of users for a reason. In the study, at the 3 month mark 2 of the stump-tailed macaques had detectable plasma RU58841 and metabolites. By the 6 month mark, only 1 of the stump-tailed macaques had detectable plasma RU58841 and metabolites. If there was a cumulative drug effect we would have seen more animals with detectable metabolites after an additional 3 months of dosing, not less. What most fail to consider is that RU58841 is non-steroidal and acts as a competitive silent antagonist of the androgen receptor. This means that even if RU58841 goes systemic, by creating a blockade of the androgen receptor, RU58841 prevents the negative feedback androgens would normally create via the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) in men. By binding to androgen receptors, RU58841 will induce anti-androgen effects without reducing serum androgen levels in the body. Finasteride on the other hand works by directly crushing DHT levels rather than by occupying androgen receptors. The ideal treatment would be a topical non-steroidal anti-androgen or SARM with a high binding affinity, and harmless metabolites void of anti-androgenic activity upon systemic absorption. Achieving Complete Hair Loss Protection By Addressing The Androgen Receptor, Not Just 5α-Reductase When you inhibit 5α-Reductase with Finasteride or Dutasteride, serum Testosterone and Estrogen levels increase will increase. A common mistake is to ignore the fact that scalp Testosterone levels rise dramatically after inhibiting 5α-Reductase. This occurs to an even greater degree with Dutasteride use, and I believe is the reason why some men experience accelerated hair loss after switching from Finasteride to Dutasteride. Typically, most men will see better results with Dutasteride as scalp DHT is almost always going to be more of a problem than scalp Testosterone. However, the consequent spike in scalp Testosterone levels with Dutasteride use is significant, and Testosterone will bind to androgen receptors and induce miniaturization just the same. 5 mg of Finasteride resulted in a 23% increase in scalp Testosterone levels with a concurrent 41% suppression of scalp DHT levels. 0.5 mg Dutasteride resulted in a 99% increase in scalp Testosterone levels with a concurrent 51% suppression of scalp DHT levels. This is why the androgen receptor needs to be addressed, not just nuking 5α-reductase with Dutasteride. Scalp Testosterone will still slowly chip away at your hair, regardless if DHT is there or not. In addition, Finasteride is insufficient to completely eliminate scalp DHT, which also needs to be taken into account and addressed. When you inhibit 5α-reductase, that Testosterone that would have otherwise converted to DHT doesn't just disappear, it remains as the parent hormone, thus raising total Testosterone levels in the body. Dutasteride doesn't just randomly stop working one day, Testosterone and other endogenous androgens are still eating away at your hair, just at a much slower pace than DHT would.  The only way to prevent other androgens from binding to androgen receptors and miniaturizing hair follicles is by competing with them for androgen receptor binding. That's where the therapeutic promise of topical anti-androgens, anti-androgens in general, selective androgen receptor modulators, and other similar compounds that bind to androgen receptors can come into play and provide a compounding level of protection when needed, or as a form of monotherapy on their own if sufficient. If you only inhibit 5α-reductase with Finasteride, not only will you have residual amounts of DHT, but you will also have a spike in scalp Testosterone that is totally unaccounted for. Unfortunately, you can't just partially inhibit 5α-reductase and expect complete protection for life unless you have very mild hair loss to begin with. Permanent prevention can only be achieved by addressing the androgen receptor itself. For some individuals, Finasteride monotherapy will be sufficient to stave off hair loss for a couple decades, but that residual DHT and spike in Testosterone will continue to chip away and eventually win in the end. For some with aggressive hair loss, Finasteride monotherapy isn't even sufficient in the short-term. At the end of the day, regardless of how aggressive your hair loss is, prevention is mediated via the androgen receptor. Other treatment options may be implemented that interact with different downstream mechanisms in the cascade of events that lead to hair loss, but they will unlikely prove sufficient to completely mitigate androgenic alopecia on their own, and will be best utilized as an adjunct treatment to achieve a compounding level of protection with other compounds. Which Is Better For Hair Loss Prevention? RU58841 and Finasteride work via different mechanisms of action. They shouldn't be pitted against one another as neither are likely to prove sufficient to completely prevent hair loss on their own. DHT has a much higher binding affinity than RU58841, but Testosterone doesn't. Those with very aggressive hair loss would likely need to use a massive dose of RU58841 to compete with all of their scalp DHT and Testosterone. On the other hand, Finasteride can significantly decrease DHT levels, but causes a subsequent spike in scalp Testosterone that goes completely unaccounted for that will still work in tandem with the residual DHT to miniaturize hair follicles. A more complete level of protection would be achieved by using both Finasteride and RU58841, not one or the other. Finasteride will significantly reduce the amount of scalp DHT, and leave a hormonal environment that RU58841 is more capable of dealing with. RU58841's binding affinity is at least as high as Testosterone, so if most of the DHT is cleared out of the way, RU58841 only has to compete with Testosterone and a much lower amount of DHT. Expecting RU58841 to out-compete all endogenous DHT and Testosterone without any assistance when its binding affinity is several times lower than DHT is a strategy that would likely only work long-term for someone with mild hair loss. The dose and frequency of administration relative to the half-life needs to be kept in mind as well. There's a dose-dependent response with all drugs, including anti-androgens. Just because a 5% RU58841 solution applied once per day proves sufficient for one guy, that doesn't mean that dosage will be sufficient for you too. Hair loss is basically just a giant chess match where the most efficacious treatments will either knock out the opponent (decrease endogenous androgen levels), or occupy a more advantageous position on the chess board (binding to androgen receptors). The more chess pieces you have, the better your chance of winning against the finite number of opponent chess pieces. This is why certain anti-androgens with very poor binding affinity can still be effective in a clinical setting. An anti-androgen dosed very aggressively will eventually overpower Testosterone and DHT just by sheer volume (e.g. Bicalutamide). The same applies for RU58841, assuming it gets absorbed, which will boil down to scalp skin porosity, vehicle, and so on. If you opted for CB-03-01 instead of RU58841, the same concept would apply, it would just need to be dosed even more aggressively until sufficient AR binding is achieved. For those prone to side effects, that strategy may be the better alternative with CB-03-01 rather than RU58841 as it seems that the metabolites of CB-03-01 may be better tolerated at higher dosages than those of RU58841. The binding affinity of CB-03-01 is much lower than RU58841 though and it is very cost prohibitive, so for the time being, that strategy is likely not viable for most. Where To Buy RU58841 Most RU58841 sources do not third party test their products, nor do they have any satisfactory level of quality control whatsoever. I strongly advise that before you buy RU58841 from a company online you thoroughly evaluate their track record, their third party test results, and how they are marketing their products in general.

Ibutamoren (MK-677) is a growth hormone secretagogue and ghrelin receptor agonist. It increases the endogenous secretion of GH and IGF-1. A growth hormone secretagogue is simply a substance that signals the pituitary gland in your body to secrete more growth hormone. MK-677 is orally bioavailable, therefore it can be swallowed (no injections needed) [R]. To date, there have been no viable orally bioavailable alternatives to synthetic human growth hormone injections. Much like SARMs, it is non-steroidal, but contrary to popular belief, MK-677 is not a SARM in any capacity, despite commonly being thrown into that category. MK-677 will not negatively affect natural testosterone levels or endocrine function in any capacity at all, as it does not suppress any male sex hormones. MK-677 has a much longer shelf-life than reconstituted GH, and does not need to be stored in the fridge or freezer to prevent degradation [R]. Clinical trials are currently assessing how viable of a potential treatment MK-677 is for addressing growth hormone deficiencies, muscle wasting diseases, Osteoporosis and a myriad of other related conditions.  MK-677 Effects Increases Bone Density In a 12 month study conducted on postmenopausal osteoporotic women, 25 mg of MK-677 per day increased bone mineral density and was well tolerated without any significantly concerning side effects [R]. In a 2 month randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study on 24 healthy obese men (ages 19-49), 25 mg of MK-677 per day increased markers of bone formation within the first 2 weeks, and increased serum osteocalcin levels at the 2 month mark. Predictably, large increases in serum IGF-1 levels were also noted [R]. In a clinical study evaluating the changes in serum IGF‐I and markers of bone turnover in 187 elderly adults (65 years or older) lasting 2–9 weeks, dosages of 10-50 mg were administered once daily. All treated individuals experienced increased bone turnover, regardless if they were healthy or functionally impaired men or women [R]. Builds Muscle Growth hormone (GH) can accelerate lipolysis, and has an an anabolic effect in muscle tissue by increasing insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and nitrogen retention [R]. In a 2 month study on 24 healthy obese men using 25 mg of MK-677 per day, 3 kg of lean muscle mass was gained in the MK-677 treated group compared to the placebo group. According to a DEXA scan, total body fat did not change during the study, equating to a gain of 6.62 pounds of muscle in the MK-677 treated group [R]. It should be noted that this conclusion has limitations, due to the fact that intracellular water very likely contributed a fair portion of that “fat-free mass” that was gained.  In another study conducted on sixty-five healthy men and women ages 60-81, 25 mg MK-677 per day increased fat-free mass (FFM) by 1.6 kg relative to placebo. The average lifetime loss of fat-free mass in adults is ~ 5.5, therefore MK-677 has exhibited the potential to offset aging induced catabolism by as much as 29% [R]. Increases BMR Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) was increased by MK-677 at 2 weeks of treatment, even after correction for the increase in fat-free mass [R]. Due to its positive effect on body composition, there is a case to make in regards to MK-677 being a possible treatment for obesity. BMR (a) and BMR corrected for the increase in FFM (b) during 2-month treatment with MK-677 (25 mg) or placebo daily Increases Nitrogen Retention Ibutamoren exhibits blatantly anti-catabolic properties, one of which is its ability to retain nitrogen even in a steep caloric deficit. Eight healthy volunteers (ages 24–39 yr) were calorically restricted (18 kcal/kg·day) for two 14-day periods. During the last 7 days of each diet period, subjects received either oral MK-677 25 mg or placebo once daily. MK-677 reversed nitrogen wasting caused by the caloric deficit, suggesting that if these short-term anabolic effects are sustainable, it could be a viable treatment for those experiencing chronic disease, or other muscle wasting catabolic conditions [R]. Improves Sleep Quality A study with eight young subjects (18-30 years) and six older subjects (65-71 years) found that MK-677 was able to increase REM sleep by as much as 50% [R]. Many anecdotal logs report much deeper sleep as a result of MK-677 usage as well (myself included). Longevity Natural Growth Hormone secretion downregulates with age, consequently lowering serum IGF-1 levels in the body, which results in significant lean muscle catabolism and increased mortality [R, R]. By restoring GH and IGF-1 levels to that of young healthy adults, it is likely that a significant amount of muscle and bone degradation could be prevented entirely. In a study conducted on sixty-five healthy men and women ages 60-81, 25 mg MK-677 treatment per day resulted in increases in GH and IGF-1 levels to levels seen in young adults [R]. In another study conducted on one hundred sixty‐one hip‐fracture patients aged 65 and older, 25 mg MK-677 treatment per day increased serum IGF‐I levels by 84% [R]. Higher levels of IGF-1 are also associated with longer telomere length (a generally accepted marker of aging) [R]. Improves Immune System A study on mice showed that a growth hormone secretagogue could generally duplicate the same enhancement of the immune system observed by treating mice with synthetic GH injections. Statistically significant changes in immunological parameters in the young and old mice treated with the growth hormone secretagogue were noted. Tumor resistance increased substantially, and there were signs of anti-aging whereby a deficiency in the thymus in mice (a result of aging) was reversed entirely [R]. Currently, growth hormone injections are an approved treatment for treating muscle wasting caused by AIDS, and the findings in this study would suggest that a growth hormone secretagogue like MK-677 could fulfill a clinical need for AIDS patients and individuals undergoing chemotherapy and irradiation. It would also have the obvious advantage of being orally bioavailable, whereas GH can only be administered via injection. Hair Loss Prevention IGF-1 has been shown to affect follicular proliferation and differentiation, remodelling of tissue, as well as the hair growth cycle itself. More evidence is arising to suggest that IGF-1 plays an important role as a regulator in hair follicle biology. It should be noted that patients with growth hormone (GH) deficiency resulting from defective hormone binding with low serum IGF-1 levels exhibit very sparse hair growth [R]. Anecdotally, several users of synthetic GH injections and Ibutamoren have reported a faster growth rate of their hair, as well as improved overall hair density. Prevention Of Growth Hormone Deficiency MK-677 has exhibited the ability to increase serum GH and IGF-1 levels to that of a young healthy adult, thus it was obviously desirable to assess if it could be a potential alternative treatment to growth hormone injections for those diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency. In a study conducted on nine severely GH-deficient men ages 17-34 yr who had been treated for GH deficiency with GH during childhood, once daily dosages of 10 or 50 mg MK-677 or placebo were administered. 10 mg MK-677 increased serum IGF-1 levels by 52% on average, and increased GH levels by 79% on average. 50 mg MK-677 increased serum IGF-1 levels by 79% on average, and increased GH levels by 82% on average. These improvements are indicative of Ibutamoren's potential as an alternative form of treatment for GH deficiency during childhood [R]. Mechanism Of Action Growth hormone is secreted by the somatotrophes of the anterior pituitary gland in multiple pulses each day. Growth hormone is released into the blood stream and then stimulates the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which stimulates linear growth before epiphyseal fusion and also exerts several metabolic effects throughout life. After ingestion, MK-677 increases somatotrophe secretion of GH via signalling the pituitary gland to secrete a sufficient amount of growth hormone [R, R]. The most common cause of GH deficiency in childhood is believed to be caused by a lack of adequate stimulation of the pituitary gland by hypothalamic GHRH, which is why something like Ibutamoren which can systemically increase IGF-1 levels for 24 hours with a single oral dose is very promising for potential clinical use [R]. The likely mechanism of action following MK-677 administration is the activation of the ghrelin receptor by MK-677, with feedback by IGF-I preventing excess GH production [R]. The mechanism of action through which MK-677 promotes GH secretion is comparable to growth hormone releasing peptides like GHRP-6, GHRP-2, Ipamorelin and Hexarelin, with GHRP-6 being the most similar in regards to the amount of ghrelin receptor activation that occurs post-administration. MK-677 does not stimulate a greater quantity of secretion events per day (number of GH pulsations), but rather it stimulates a greater total 24 hour GH production rate [R]. In other words, Ibutamoren can substantially increase the strength of each GH pulsation that occurs in the body. Effects of treatment on 24-hour mean GH and IGF-1 and GH secretory dynamics Benefits Of Higher GH Levels and IGF-1 Levels Healthy GH and IGF-1 levels support a variety of positive benefits in the body. As mentioned earlier, these benefits include anti-aging properties, which is why HGH is commonly referred to as the real “fountain of youth.” GH Benefits  GH promotes and increases the synthesis of new protein tissues, allowing new muscle to be built Metabolizes fat incredibly well, improves complexion, Has dramatic anti-aging properties Increases hair growth (where you want it) Improves sleeping patterns (making for fewer unintended awakenings and better REM-stage sleep) Produces more energy May improve sexual performance Increases bone density which prevents injury and helps promote healing Can improve the quality and duration of heart and kidneys  IGF-1 Benefits  IGF-1 supports cellular division (hyperplasia), making it the only hormone that can actually create brand new muscle cells via muscular cell division. Supports the repair of nerve damage Lowers body fat levels Exhibits anti-aging properties by tightening up loose skin Aids in the repair of bones, tendons and ligaments.  IGF-1 Hyperplasia The cellular division aspect of IGF-1 is what makes it so attractive to bodybuilders and athletes, as an individuals “genetic potential” essentially refers to how much hypertrophy can be induced in a person's muscle cells. Only so much hypertrophy can be achieved, even with the addition of exogenous anabolic steroids and/or insulin. The two primary mechanisms by which muscle mass may be increased are hypertrophy (increase in myofibre size), and hyperplasia (increase in myofibre number). It is generally well accepted that there are a fixed amount of fibres within a muscle, however, it has been suggested that cell splitting can occur in these fibres [R]. While there is no evidence of this in humans via clinical studies, bodybuilders hypothesize that supraphysiological amounts of IGF-1 in the body can cause cellular hyperplasia, whereby myofibres split in two, to create brand new muscle fibres. In theory, via this process, one could split new muscle cells, and then induce hypertrophy in those new muscle fibres and achieve greater levels of musculature than would have been possible otherwise via resistance training, diet and hormonal assistance. MK-677 Clinical Trials  Lumos Pharma acquired the license for Ibutamoren (MK-677) in September, 2018 [R]. The compound was thereafter referred to as “LUM-201” by the company. LUM-201 Pipeline Right now, MK-677 (LUM-201) is in phase 2 trials being investigated as a potential treatment for Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (PGHD). To date, MK-677 has been studied in more than 1200 people (~200 children and~1000 adult and elderly patients), and was generally well tolerated. MK-677 Limitations While MK-677 will effectively stimulate the secretion of growth hormone in those with a functioning hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis in most cases, there are certain scenarios in which it is ineffective.  Individuals who have a non-functioning hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis Individuals who are unable to secrete growth hormone Individuals who simply do not respond to MK-677 at all Approximately 30% of children with PGHD will not be able to restore healthy GH and IGF-1 levels with MK-677 treatment  MK-677 Results (Anecdotal/Recreational Use) There are several testimonials online reviewing Ibutamoren's applications in a performance enhancing context. These logs are anecdotal, but anecdotal experiences still can provide insight into how MK-677 performs in scenarios that will very likely never be assessed in clinical studies. In certain cases, anecdotal logs can actually be far more revealing of important information than clinical studies. A good example of that is the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) Andarine and its potential to cause temporary vision impairment, which is a side effect that was not discovered during its development (although perhaps it could be the reason why it was abandoned). Anecdotal experiences of Ibutamoren commonly compare its effects to synthetic GH injections. It is becoming more common for athletes seeking performance enhancement to turn to MK-677 before GH due to the prohibitive costs of HGH, the convenience of oral administration over injections, more flexible storage requirements, and nearly identical results when comparing Ibutamoren to modest dosages of daily GH injections. Gains of 5-10 pounds of fat-free mass within the first few weeks of MK-677 use are commonly reported, however, it should be noted that the majority of that is intracellular water. My MK-677 Review I have used MK-677 a few times over the past couple years now. Each time the results have been fairly dramatic, even while on moderate dosages of anabolic steroids. In my experience, intramuscular water and nitrogen retention is more apparent with MK-677 than GH. That can be a good and bad thing though, depending on the goals of the user. Every time I have used MK-677, within a week my weight would jump up 7-10 pounds. The only thing that I can think of that will make more of a dramatic difference in that short a span of time is Dianabol. This isn't necessarily a positive thing though, and can actually be seen as a negative, depending on the goals of the user as I mentioned above. If I had to compare 25 mg of MK-677 to something I would compare the results to 2 iu’s of high quality generic GH, or a few daily 100 mcg injections of GHRP-6 coupled with concurrent 100 mcg injections of Modified GRF (1-29). The short-term cosmetic changes and appetite increase caused by MK-677 are much more comparable to multiple injections of GHRP-6 + Modified GRF (1-29) than traditional GH though. When I use MK-677 I experience ravenous hunger that makes it nearly impossible to adhere to a reasonable caloric intake. This is due to MK-677's interaction with the ghrelin receptor. The incredibly heightened appetite is the main reason I avoid this compound now, as I cannot cut down to sub 10% body fat when I have above average levels of ghrelin receptor activation around the clock. Its appetite stimulating effects seem to subside to a large extent after a few weeks of continuous use, which makes it more tolerable, but I now avoid using ghrelin mimetics entirely unless I am eating above maintenance. I've also noticed that MK-677 seems to very significantly offset hair loss. Every time I use MK-677, my hair grows much faster, and there is a remarkable improvement in my hairs overall density. Areas that are normally more diffuse than I prefer fill in quite a bit, very quickly whenever I use MK-677. It has become my candidate of choice among growth stimulators for hair loss prevention. In terms of side effects, I have noticed some fairly significant lethargy from MK-677 (anything that raises GH and IGF-1 will do this), however, I was able to mitigate that to some extent by taking my daily dosage right before going to bed. MK-677 Dosage  MK-677 exhibits a dose dependent positive effect on serum GH and IGF-1 levels. The clinical data suggests that Ibutamoren begins exhibiting diminishing returns above and beyond dosages of 25 mg per day. The remains consistent among the majority of the clinical studies, with almost every trial utilizing a once daily oral dosage of 25 mg of MK-677 to assess Ibutamoren's efficacy relative to placebo. When comparing high dosages of MK-677 to low dosages, there wasn't a significant difference between GH levels at dosages of 10 mg and 50 mg per day, however, there was a significant difference in serum IGF-1 levels between the 10 mg per day dosing group, and the 50 mg per day dosing group. In severely GH-deficient men ages 17-34 yr, on average, 10 mg MK-677 increased serum IGF-1 levels by 52%, and increased GH levels by 79%, while 50 mg MK-677 increased serum IGF-1 levels by 79%, and increased GH levels by 82% [R]. How Much Does MK-677 Increase GH And IGF-1 Levels? MK-677 has exhibited substantial increases in serum GH and IGF-1 levels in multiple clinical trials now. In a 12 month study conducted on postmenopausal osteoporotic women, 25 mg of MK-677 per day administered with or without alendronate for 12 months increased IGF-1 levels by approximately 40%. Serum IGF-1 levels appeared to start tapering down over the next 11 months after they peaked in month 1. This suggests that utilizing MK-677 in a cyclical fashion may be a more beneficial way of maximizing its efficacy during use [R].  In the 2 month study on 24 healthy obese males , after two weeks of treatment with 25 mg of MK-677 per day serum IGF‐I levels increased approximately 40% compared with pretreatment values and this effect was sustained throughout the treatment period [R, R].  Serum concentrations of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 during 2-month treatment with MK-677 (25 mg) or placebo daily in obese males In a 2 year study including sixty-five healthy men and women ages 60-81, daily MK-677 significantly increased GH and IGF-1 levels to those of healthy young adults without serious adverse effects [R]. Serum 24-h mean GH results in pivotal year 1 Serum 24-h mean IGF-1 results in pivotal year 1 In a study conducted on nine severely GH-deficient men ages 17-34 yr, 10 mg MK-677 increased serum IGF-1 levels by 52% on average, and increased GH levels by 79% on average. 50 mg MK-677 increased serum IGF-1 levels by 79% on average, and increased GH levels by 82% on average [R]. Placebo Vs 10 mg MK-677 Vs 50 mg MK-677 in GH deficient men – GH Levels Placebo Vs 10 mg MK-677 Vs 50 mg MK-677 in GH deficient men – IGF-1 Levels Side Effects Increased Appetite MK-677 will almost undoubtedly greatly increase appetite. Besides acting as a potent growth hormone secretagogue, MK-677 is also an oral ghrelin mimetic. Ghrelin is the “hunger hormone” that your stomach secretes in order to regulate your appetite. By artificially stimulating the secretion of that hormone, the body is tricked into being hungry, even when it wouldn't have been otherwise. MK-677 has a very significant effect on the ghrelin receptor, more so than any other ghrelin receptor agonist with the exception of GHRP-6. How MK-677 and GHRP-6 differ is that GHRP-6 is in and out of the body very quickly (half-life of 20 minutes), whereas MK-677 will simulate the actions of ghrelin for several hours, thereby resulting in greatly increased levels of hunger all day long [R]. While MK-677 has a positive effect on body composition, I don't believe the clinical data takes into account how important diet adherence really is when it comes down to what will get someone in shape. In almost all cases, having chronic ghrelin receptor stimulation would make it nearly impossible to stick to a strict caloric deficit in order to reap the true metabolic benefits that Ibutamoren can provide in the first place. It's easy to see why this compound is recreationally used so often as an appetite stimulant, as the ghrelin mimetic properties are incredibly potent. Lethargy Though not reported in the clinical data, I can assure you that anything that increases your GH and IGF-1 levels will increase your lethargy. Regardless if GH/IGF-1 is increased via synthetic gh injections, growth hormone releasing peptides, or growth hormone secretagogues like MK-677, increased levels of lethargy is an expected and common side effect. Intense Dreams Dreams (both lucid and non-lucid) are much more common during the REM cycle of sleep. As sleep affects the regulation of growth hormone (GH), typically, getting a deep and restful sleep is associated with optimal growth hormone secretion, and consequently, more dreaming [R]. Stimulation of endogenous GH secretion with MK-677 can improve sleep quality, promote the body to enter the REM cycle, and in turn experience more dreams. Water Retention A common side effect from elevated GH and IGF-1 levels is water retention. Expectedly, the most common side effect aside from increased appetite was transient edema and muscle pain in clinical trials [R]. The muscle pain likely being an indirect side effect caused by intracellular water retention putting increased stress on the joints and muscles. Increased Blood Pressure Increased blood pressure is an indirect side effect resulting from edema, which is one of the most common MK-677 side effects [R]. Elevated Blood Sugar & Reduced Insulin Sensitivity Although several clinical studies found no change in blood glucose levels, there were a couple studies where MK-677 caused an elevation of fasted blood glucose levels and decreased insulin sensitivity [R, R]. GH causes blood sugar levels to rise, which in turn requires the pancreas to work harder to compensate and release insulin to bring blood sugar levels back down to homeostasis. Chronic GH elevation can create chronic pancreatic stress in certain scenarios, which eventually can result in pancreatic beta cell degeneration, and insulin resistance. Chronic blood glucose elevation and pancreatic cell degeneration is what eventually leads to Type 2 Diabetes. Individuals with other lifestyle factors that contribute to insulin resistance as is (excessive carbohydrate intake, holding too much body fat, lack of exercise, etc.), or have genetic predispositions that increase their likelihood of Diabetes, could potentially end up pushing themselves over the brink and become Type 2 Diabetic with MK-677 or synthetic growth hormone usage. Reactive Hypoglycemia MK-677 can raise blood glucose levels, which is a mechanism that is autocorrected and regulated by the pancreas in healthy individuals. In insulin resistant individuals, MK-677 can cause reactive hypoglycemia, whereby sharp spikes in blood sugar can cause an exaggerated level of insulin secretion and glucose uptake into the cells, consequently crashing blood sugar and causing hypoglycemia [R]. This poor endogenous regulation of blood glucose levels is typically indicative of some degree of insulin resistance in an individual. Signs and symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia may include hunger, weakness, shakiness, sleepiness, sweating, lightheadedness and anxiety. Potential Cancer Cell Hyperplasia Despite the clinical data showing a positive effect on resistance to tumor progression and upregulation of the immune system in mice, the proliferative properties of IGF-1 inherently suggest that MK-677 could potentially accelerate the growth rate of existing cancer cells in the body. This is why Metformin is shown to help prevent cancer, because it lowers serum IGF-1 levels in the body. This is also an argument commonly made as to why high levels of IGF-1 will shorten the lifespan of a person, rather than extend it. Tingly Or Numb Fingers And Hands This is a common side effect of elevated growth hormone levels, and is commonplace among anecdotal reports on Ibutamoren. Enhanced Fear In Rats One study on rats evaluated MK-677's potential to cause enhanced levels of fear. There is evidence to support that one of the ways ghrelin is modulated is through exposure to stress. What this study intended to assess specifically was if rats would have a greater likelihood of experiencing fear and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when their ghrelin receptors are artificially stimulated 24/7 with a ghrelin receptor agonist (MK-677). So, rats were continuously administered MK-677, and frightened constantly, and their difference in response (MK-677 treated vs non treated) was assessed. Rats with chronic ghrelin elevation were found to have enhanced fear memory compared to baseline [R]. This same response has yet to be replicated in human trials, or in anecdotal logs. PCT (Post Cycle Therapy) MK-677 does not cause endocrine suppression, it doesn't lower natural testosterone levels, and it doesn't inhibit LH, FSH or SHBG [R, R]. It does not raise estrogen either, which has an indirect effect on testosterone suppression [R]. As MK-677 doesn't suppress any sex hormones, or increase any antagonizing hormones, there is no hormonal suppression that occurs via MK-677 use, and therefore would not require a PCT phase. Half-Life The elimination half-life of MK-677 is 4.7 hours; with IGF-1 levels remaining elevated with a single oral dose for up to 24 hours [R]. Once per day dosing of MK-677 has proven to be a viable frequency of administration throughout all of the clinical studies to date. MK-677 Vs HGH Injections The majority of competitive bodybuilders and other performance enhancement seeking athletes view growth hormone as a valuable tool for enhancing their muscle growth and fat loss potential. However, legitimate GH is simply unaffordable to most. With a pharmacy-grade kit of GH being upwards of $600-1000 in many instances, it can be extremely cost prohibitive just to use a modest dosage on a daily basis. With MK-677 exhibiting effects formidable to that of a modest dosage of pure GH in clinical trials, it is easy to see why it has garnered so much attention from those seeking performance enhancement. MK-677 also has the advantage of being stable in room temperature, orally bioavailable, sustaining elevated IGF-1 levels 24 hours post-ingestion, and works via stimulating natural endogenous GH secretion, as opposed to exogenous synthetic GH injections which will increase serum GH levels irrespective of the body's current endogenous production without a feedback loop to regulate that hormone levels stay within healthy limits. MK-677 Vs Peptides The main drawback of growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRP's) is that they all require 3-6 injections per day to sustain stable blood serum concentrations because of their short half-lives. MK-677 does not have this same issue, as once per day dosing elevates IGF-1 levels for up to 24 hours [R]. Although fast acting GH peptides can be effective, they are certainly not convenient at all, and just the nuisance of their required dosage frequency alone would likely drive away most people from considering it a viable GH alternative. Another major disadvantage of GHRP's is their inhibited effects in the presence of glucose. GHRP injections need to be timed correctly as elevated blood glucose levels render them dramatically less effective. When the dosage frequency of a GHRP requires 3+ injections per day to achieve stable blood serum concentrations of GH and IGF-1, ensuring that blood glucose levels aren't elevated at the time of injection during each of these shots is extremely difficult, if not nearly impossible for individuals who aren't sitting at home doing nothing day in and day out. Peptides also have the same limitations as GH, where they must be reconstituted, injected, and stored in a fridge to avoid degradation. While comparing the pros and cons of MK-677 to peptides, the clinical data is generally in favor of MK-677. However, it should be noted that there are a couple very effective combinations of the two where IGF-1 levels equivalent to high dosages of pharmaceutical grade GH can be achieved. Supplements To Take With MK-677 (Optional) Huperzine A  Certainly not mandatory, but if you want to maximize the benefits you can get from MK-677 it may be worthwhile to look at Somatostatin inhibitors. A popular supplement that is commonly used with MK-677 is Huperzine A dosed at 200 mcg three times per day. There are a couple studies with data that are often extrapolated to suggest that Huperzine A is a potent Somatostatin inhibitor [R, R]. When your body has higher than normal HGH levels, it will release Somatostatin as a counter measure to inhibit the secretion of growth hormone from somatotrope cells to bring HGH levels back to normal. This mechanism is very similar to how the body uses Myostatin to inhibit excessive muscle growth. In theory, Huperzine A would prevent Somatostatin from inhibiting pituitary released GH, and by using Huperzine A to inhibit Somatostatin, your body would then have more active/usable HGH. This is all hypothetical, and the evidence to support the efficacy of Huperzine A in this process is weak. However, Huperzine A is still a great Nootropic supplement, and it is very cheap. I use it daily anyways, and if it inhibits Somatostatin then I just see it as a fringe benefit. The reality is that the likelihood of it having a significant impact on the process of endogenous GH inhibition is low. Insulin Mimetics As MK-677 can increase your blood glucose levels via increased endogenous HGH production, using supplements as a countermeasure to keep your blood sugar lower and more stable may be a wise decision. Insulin is what is responsible for shuttling nutrients to the muscle for recovery, and it has a direct and major impact on how both your muscle and fat cells utilize amino acids and glucose. When your insulin sensitivity is high, muscle cells will readily absorb glucose and amino acids when insulin signals them to open. However, when your insulin sensitivity is low as a result of having a high level of body fat accrued on your physique, eating too many high glycemic carbohydrates (or too many carbs in general), among other potential risk factors, your natural levels of insulin are so much higher that it can have a severe desensitizing effect on muscle cells and insulin’s nutrient shuttling effects. Compounding the issue, with diminished insulin sensitivity your body will become more and more prone to convert more of the excess calories you intake as body fat, as the muscle cells are no longer absorbing and utilizing the consumed glucose and amino acids efficiently. Berberine Berberine is arguably the best over the counter supplement to improve insulin sensitivity. Clinical research has shown that Berberine greatly promotes glucose absorption by muscle cells, and is so effective at reducing blood glucose levels it is comparable to Metformin (a prescription drug for blood sugar control). *One important thing to note about Berberine is that it inhibits the enzyme CYP3A4, a member of the Cytochrome P450 family. This enzyme directly dictates how fast the liver can break down medications. Because of this, Berberine may slow down the rate at which the liver breaks down medications, equating to potentially longer life spans of medications you are using, as well as potentially inducing stronger overall effects from those medications than intended. One example in particular is if you are on TRT and use an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) to keep your Estrogen levels in the sweet spot, having Berberine in your system may potentiate the effects of that AI (as the liver isn't breaking it down as efficiently as normal), which could potentially tank your Estrogen far below what it would normally be at on that same AI dosage without Berberine in your system. Keep this in mind prior to the usage of Berberine.* Some other effective supplements at controlling blood sugar are Cinnamon Extract  Cinnamon Extract has potent anti-diabetic effects, proving to aid insulin function by a significant degree (more than 20-fold in vitro), reducing blood glucose levels, and even improving blood lipid profile. Other studies also noted blatant improvements in overall insulin sensitivity. Alpha Lipoic Acid  A decrease in blood glucose is noted with oral supplementation of Alpha Lipoic Acid, encouraging heightened insulin sensitivity and nutrient partitioning. Fenugreek  Clinical research has shown that Fenugreek lowers blood glucose levels and improves the body’s tolerance to glucose itself. Fenugreek has even been used to mitigate blood sugar metabolism problems like Diabetes. Kaempferol  Kaempferol encourages glucose uptake into myocytes and has been alleged to be as potent as insulin itself in regards to this process in particular. It may also inhibit the enzyme responsible for the production of fatty acids deriving from glucose, meaning more fat loss (or less fat gain depending on the scenario). Myricetin Proven to improve blood glucose uptake, Myricetin decreases blood glucose levels and can actually aid in the reversal of the negative effects caused by metabolic syndrome. The mechanism of action behind Myricetin’s benefits are similar to that of Kaempferol, and it also inhibits the uptake of glucose into fat cells, equating to less fat storage. Irvingia Gabonensis Irvingia Gabonensis reduces blood glucose levels and reduces fat storage through several anti-obesity mechanisms such as the inhibition triglyceride uptake. Fucoxanthin One study found a huge increase in metabolic rate with the supplementation of Fucoxanthin, roughly equating to an increased metabolic rate of around 450 calories per day. This was one study though and requires replication to see if those astounding results can be achieved with other sample groups as well. Regardless, it seems like a very promising compound, and it also was shown in studies to result in a significant decrease in blood glucose, and a significant increase in the uptake of glucose into skeletal muscle. Chromium  Chromium is an essential mineral that regulates blood glucose, insulin metabolism, and can encourage insulin sensitivity in the body. Appetite Suppressant If you are dead set on cutting with MK-677 to get shredded, I highly suggest you get an appetite suppressant, as MK-677 will almost certainly increase your appetite significantly. To be honest, I advise against cutting on MK-677 entirely unless you have adapted to the ghrelin receptor related appetite stimulation. If you are just starting MK-677, I can almost guarantee you that you will not be able to adhere to a strict diet and calorie deficit with the intense hunger that MK-677 induces when you first start using it. GH Gut  MK-677 will not directly cause “GH gut.” However, it can contribute to it. GH gut is something that is commonly attributed to the abuse of human growth hormone, however, MK-677 does not increase serum GH and IGF-1 levels in the body as high as supraphysiological dosages of growth hormone. While it will increase blood sugar, it has not shown to be independently capable of causing GH gut without compounding factors like suboptimal body composition, poor diet and exogenous GH injections. There is no documented case of this, I'm just asserting a hypothetical perfect storm scenario in which high levels of insulin resistance and compromised gut health could occur that would lead to “GH gut.”  Disclaimer: The information included in this article is intended for entertainment and informational purposes only.

LGD-4033, also known as Ligandrol, was originally developed by Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and was licensed afterwards to Viking Therapeutics. It is now officially named VK5211 under Viking Therapeutics. LGD-4033 is commonly incorrectly referred to as “Anabolicum”, which is actually the brand name for the anabolic androgenic steroid Quinbolone developed by Parke-Davis [R, R]. LGD-4033 is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) developed to be a potential treatment for a variety of musculoskeletal degenerative diseases.  The main goal of all SARMs essentially boils down to finding the right compound that provides the same therapeutic benefits of testosterone with improved safety, tolerability and patient acceptance. So far, LGD-4033 has demonstrated an incredible efficacy profile, and the clinical data suggests it could be a best-in-class small molecule SARM.   LGD-4033 Potential Clinical Applications Despite being the endogenous hormone that men naturally produce, Testosterone use in a clinical setting for treating muscle and bone wasting diseases is extremely limited because of its androgenicity and pharmacokinetic issues. Testosterone is not selective enough for muscle tissue and bone relative to other androgen affected tissues like the prostate, and is not orally bioavailable [R]. This is why a SARM like LGD-4033 is so promising, as it is non-steroidal, extremely selective, and exhibits a high level of bioavailability [R]. Testosterone exhibits a 2:1 selectivity for muscle to prostate [R].  In men, treatment with testosterone and other anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) could result in prostate growth stimulation and artificially induce hypogonadism, hence why a more selective treatment that can target muscle tissue and bone specifically would be a more desirable alternative [R]. In women, treatment with testosterone or other AAS can lead to the development of male gender characteristics (virilization), hence why a more selective treatment that is capable of fulfilling the same functions of androgens would be a more desirable alternative [R]. Testosterone induces significant androgenic activity at therapeutic dosages which disqualifies it entirely as an optimal treatment for muscle and bone wasting diseases. This is why SARMs like Ligandrol may prove to be safer, more effective alternatives [R]. The ideal anabolic agent should demonstrate anabolic selectivity in muscle and bone without suppressing luteinizing hormone (LH), not negatively interact with other steroid receptors in the body, exhibit a high level of oral bioavailability without being 17 alpha-alkylated, and avoid 5-alpha reduction to DHT and aromatization into Estrogen [R]. SARMs were first discovered in 1998, following which several different compounds were developed by a variety of pharmaceutical companies in order to find a viable compound to satisfy this obvious need in degenerative disease treatment [R]. Mechanism Of Action LGD-4033 has a high level of bioavailability, meaning it can be dosed orally as opposed to requiring intramuscular injection, as is the case with most traditional anabolic steroids. It also does not require 17 alpha-alkylation in order to be absorbed and utilized in the body, as opposed to 17 alpha-alkylated oral anabolic steroids that are intentionally designed to be liver toxic with a methyl or ethyl group at the C17α position so they are orally bioavailable. SARMs, like LGD-4033, stimulate androgen receptors in a selective way, whereby they induce a significantly greater amount of anabolic activity in the body relative to androgenic activity [R]. LGD-4033 binds to the androgen receptor with an extremely high affinity (Ki of ~1 nM) and selectivity, and once it does this it exerts anabolic effects in muscle tissue and bone. Due to the tissue-selective mechanism of action and oral route of administration, Ligandrol may be effective at producing all of the therapeutic benefits of testosterone with a vastly improved safety profile. The negative effects that stem from traditionally used anabolic steroids converting to 5α-reduced androgens that can increase the risk of benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate carcinoma, acne breakouts, and substantially expedited male pattern baldness could potentially be averted entirely if LGD-4033 became an approved treatment alternative in a clinical setting. LGD-4033 could potentially provide a sufficient amount of anabolic stimulation to completely mitigate muscle wasting and bone degradation, while simultaneously avoiding the occurrence of androgenic side effects in women entirely. The lack of androgenicity is favorable for both men and women, but it proves especially useful in the context of treating women, as even low dosages of anabolic androgenic steroids would induce virilization. Finding a balance between a therapeutic amount of anabolic activity with a near complete absence of androgenic activity is extremely difficult to integrate into an anabolic agent, but the clinical data suggests that Ligandrol may be capable of achieving just that. After binding to the androgen receptor, LGD-4033 blatantly exhibits the ability to increase muscle mass and strength, and it is also reported to increase bone formation, bone strength and decrease bone resorption [R]. Aside from Ostarine, LGD-4033 is the closest SARM to making it through clinical trials and being approved. LGD-4033 Clinical Trials LGD-4033 (VK5211) Pipeline Preclinical LGD-4033 has undergone extensive testing in a number of preclinical animal models. Preclinical Rat Models The data revealed a greater than 500-fold selectivity of muscle tissue to prostate in rats. A greater than 500:1 anabolic to androgenic selectivity would make LGD-4033 the most selective SARM to date, even more so than BMS-564,929, which has a selectivity of 160:1, and may have had its overall potency in muscle tissue exaggerated in its preclinical findings [R]. In the preclinical studies castrated rats that were given LGD-4033 experienced increased muscle size, and in a rat model of osteoporosis, the rats experienced increased bone mineral density. To exhibit tissue selectivity in rats, they were castrated and left untreated for 14 days to provide ample time for muscle and prostate atrophy. Following which, the rats were administered varying dosages of LGD-4033 for the next 14 days. The following graph illustrates the data derived from the preclinical studies which exhibits how much LGD-4033 stimulated muscle growth relative to prostate growth in comparison to Testosterone.    LGD-4033 Selectivity For Muscle To Prostate Compared To Testosterone According to Viking, Testosterone shows no tissue selectivity in the data, which isn't exactly true, as it does exhibit a 2:1 selectivity up to a certain point. Any anabolic agent will become more androgenic:anabolic the higher the dosages are pushed, as a diminishing returns effect sets in with the anabolic component. The goal of SARMs is simply to replicate the therapeutic benefits of Testosterone though, not to create a super hormone that can dose dependently build muscle with limitless capabilities while simultaneously having 0 androgenic effects at all dosages, as that would be unreasonable and impossible to develop (for now). LGD-4033 stacked up against Testosterone very well in the preclinical models with a greater than 500x tissue selectivity of muscle to prostate. In the preclinical rat model of osteoporosis, ovariectomized female rats were allowed to develop osteopenia for eight weeks before once-daily oral treatment with LGD-4033 for 12 weeks. LGD-4033 successfully increased lumbar spine bone mineral density as effectively as Estradiol and Testosterone (graph on the left), and also significantly decreased trabecular bone turnover compared to placebo (graph on the right).     Preclinical Primate Model In a preclinical primate model, Cynomolgus monkeys were orally administered Ligandrol once per day at dosages of 0, 0.6, 3, 15, or 75 mg/kg for 13 weeks. Ligandrol treatment resulted in a dramatic increase in lean muscle mass compared to the placebo group. The results showed a significant increase in body weight in both male and female monkeys during the study. Body weight increase was measured in % gained (y-axis of the graphs).  After 13 weeks of once per day dosing, there was a significant increase in body weight for all monkeys except the untreated group. The 75 mg/kg dosing was stopped after 48 days due to signs of toxicity. This isn't very relevant to Viking's Phase 2 clinical trial though, as human dosages did not exceed 2 mg per day. More than than 70% of the mass gained was retained after a four-week recovery period when the weight of the monkeys was checked again.  The preclinical data suggests that Ligandrol is highly selective for muscle tissue, and could potentially perform with a much improved therapeutic profile in a clinical setting relative to testosterone. Phase 1 Three Phase 1 studies on LGD-4033 were successfully accomplished. The Phase 1 trials are the first stage of testing in human subjects designed to assess safety, side effects, best dosage, and formulation method for the drug. The takeaway from all Phase 1 human trials was that LGD-4033 exhibits a very encouraging safety profile and tolerability at dosages that provide significant improvements in lean muscle mass, and positive trends in strength and performance measurements. Single Ascending Dose Study The first Phase 1 trial involving LGD-4033 was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial conducted in 2009 on 48 healthy male volunteers. The volunteers were divided into six cohorts and received an escalating daily dosage of LGD-4033 ranging from 0.1 mg per day to 22 mg per day. All doses of LGD-4033 tested in humans (even the 22 mg per day dosage) were shown to be safe and well-tolerated, with predictable pharmacokinetics. The pharmacodynamics results showed dose-dependent reductions in total serum testosterone levels, sex-hormone binding protein (SHBG), and fasting serum HDL, which is consistent with the mechanism of action of SARMs (and all anabolic agents). 21 Day Multiple Ascending Dose Study In Healthy Young Men The second Phase 1 trial involving LGD-4033 was a placebo-controlled study conducted on 76 healthy men (21–50 years). They were randomized to placebo or 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 mg LGD-4033 daily for 21 days. Blood counts, chemistries, lipids, prostate-specific antigen, electrocardiogram, hormones, lean and fat mass, and muscle strength were measured during and for 5 weeks after intervention. LGD-4033 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated [R]. There was a dose-dependent suppression of total testosterone, SHBG, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. FSH and free testosterone only showed significant suppression at the 1 mg per day dosage. Lean muscle mass increased significantly in a dose dependent manner, with minimal changes in fat mass [R]. Hormone and lipid profiles all returned to baseline after treatment discontinuation. There were no drug related serious adverse events, no liver toxicity, no negative effect on electrocardiogram results, and no adverse effects on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels [R]. There was a dose proportional increase in drug concentration on days 1 and 21, suggesting that accumulation occurs upon multiple dosing, which is very important to note. If someone took the same dose every 24 hours, LGD-4033 would eventually accumulate to extremely high levels in the blood. It would be wiser to assume the half life is closer to 36 hours based on the clinical data in this study. Change In Lean Body Mass – LGD-4033 Phase 1 Trial LGD-4033 increased lean body mass on average 1.21 kg (2.67 pounds) at the 1 mg dosage [R]. The increase in lean body mass was dose-dependent, and can be assumed will increase more as the dosage increases. The capability of LGD-4033 to increase lean muscle mass in such a short time span without negatively affecting PSA levels bolds well for its efficacy and safety profile moving forward. 7 Day Study In Elderly Men And Women The third Phase 1 trial involving LGD-4033 was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics properties of LGD-4033 in elderly subjects. This study is assumed to be the most representative of the hip fracture population, which is the main clinical application Viking seeks approval for with LGD-4033. The end goal is to receive approval to treat patients who have suffered a hip fracture by slowing or prevent the loss of their lean body mass or bone mineral density. LGD-4033 had predictable pharmacokinetics (similar to those reported in younger male subjects) and was shown to be safe and well-tolerated at all doses evaluated with no serious adverse events observed. Phase 2 In Phase 2, the scope of treatment applications for LGD-4033 narrows as there needs to be a specific condition that the SARM is meant to treat in order to receive approval. In this trial, the efficacy and safety profile of LGD-4033 in the maintenance or improvement of lean body mass, bone mineral density, and function in patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery is assessed. Negative Changes In Body Composition Following A Hip Fracture Hip fracture is associated with a number of morbidities, most of which are a consequence of lean muscle loss and bone degradation following hip fracture surgery. Within the first year after a hip fracture, body fat levels increase by up to 7% on average, while lean muscle mass decreases by up to 11% [R, R]. Typically, healthy older females without hip fractures would only lose approximately 1% of their lean tissue per year and gain 1.7% body fat [R]. Bone mineral density also severely declines in hip fracture patients. The negative changes in body composition following a hip fracture are represented in the following graphs [R]. Lean Muscle Loss After Hip Fracture Bone Mineral Density Loss After Hip Fracture The ability to slow or prevent the loss of lean body mass or bone mineral density would likely have a profound impact on patient recovery following hip fracture. LGD-4033 Phase 2 Trial Results The first LGD-4033 phase 2 trial started October 30th in 2015 and completed in March, 2018 [R]. The clinical trial was 12 weeks long and involved 108 patients (83 women and 25 men) who were at least 65 years old and had suffered a hip fracture within the past three to seven weeks. Subjects were administered placebo, or 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, or 2.0 mg of LGD-4033 once-daily for 12 weeks. The primary goal of the trial was to assess changes in lean body mass, with secondary and exploratory endpoints including assessments of patient quality of life, functional status, change in appendicular lean mass, total lean body mass, bone mineral density and activities of daily living.  LGD-4033 produced significant increases in lean body mass and appendicular lean mass following 12 weeks of daily dosing in all subjects. A consistent dose response was observed across all primary and secondary efficacy measures. LGD-4033 exhibited encouraging safety and tolerability, and there were no drug-related serious adverse events in the study. Is LGD-4033 As Strong As Steroids? It is typically not a relevant comparison to make between Ligandrol and most steroids because the dosages that are compared are so much different. For example, 10 mg of Equipoise (Boldenone) per day would not equate to nearly as much muscle growth as 10 mg of LGD-4033 per day. I believe LGD-4033 is absolutely as potent of a muscle builder as moderate dosages of Primobolan, Turinabol, Boldenone, Anavar, and several other anabolic steroids. I have yet to see data on a steroid exhibiting a lean muscle gain of 2.67 pounds using only 1 mg per day. At therapeutic dosages, milligram for milligram LGD-4033 will outperform Anavar, Turinabol, Primobolan, Equipoise, and many other traditional anabolic steroids, with a favorable selectivity for anabolic:androgenic activity. LGD-4033 is significantly more potent than many very well known testosterone analogs [R]. LGD-4033 Vs Nandrolone In an assessment of change in lean body mass at 6 months in hip fracture patients, LGD-4033 significantly outperformed Nandrolone in muscle gain. Nandrolone is one of the few anabolic steroids that was approved for clinical use in humans, and remains a very popular steroid for performance enhancement to this day. More commonly known as “Deca” (Nandrolone with the Decanoate ester) or “NPP” (Nandrolone with the phenylpropionate ester).  LGD-4033 Vs Nandrolone LGD-4033 Vs Anavar 10 mg of LGD-4033 vastly outperforms Anavar in all efficacy measures. Lean muscle gains and strength gains are significantly more pronounced with LGD-4033, and it is just as well tolerated by both men and women. I personally know over 10 women who've tried both on separate occasions for performance enhancing purposes. Every single one reported far better results from LGD-4033. How LGD-4033 Compares To Other SARMs LGD-4033 has a competitive effect on total lean body mass relative to other clinical-stage SARMs, and is more potent on muscle compared with myostatin-targeting approaches. LGD-4033 Vs Ostarine While Ostarine also has an encouraging efficacy profile and is clearly very selective for muscle tissue relative to prostate (and other androgen affected tissues), in comparison to LGD-4033 it is weaker in almost all facets. Milligram:Milligram Ligandrol (VK5211) outperforms Ostarine (Enobosarm) with greater increases in lean muscle mass and strength.  However, Ostarine is less suppressive than LGD-4033, which can be important for recovering baseline hormone levels as quickly as possible after discontinuation. LGD-4033 Vs RAD140 (Testolone) RAD140 is commonly compared to LGD-4033 as a “bulking” compound. RAD140 is reported to be a dryer compound, with the potential to increase strength even more so than LGD-4033. Some individuals seem to respond better to one or the other, with impressive gains in strength being consistent with either of their use. When it comes to hypertrophy, LGD-4033 seems to outperform RAD140 in most instances (not always the case), making it the candidate of choice for most for sheer lean muscle size gains. It should be noted that RAD140 is still in the preclinical stage, meaning it had no current human trials to use as referential data, and those conclusions are drawn purely off of anecdotal logs. Granted, there are thousands of anecdotal logs (on humans) now to reference, which are quite insightful, but they are certainly no replacement for approved clinical trials. LGD-4033 Vs S23 S23 is a SARM in the preclinical stage being developed by GTx, Inc as a potential male hormonal contraceptive (the same company that created Ostarine). It binds to the androgen receptor harder than its predecessors (like Andarine) and has an extremely potent effect in muscle, with a high level of selectivity. Comparing LGD to S23 head to head there are many who would argue that S23 is the strongest SARM in development right now, and they could be right, however, its still in the preclinical stages, and it is extremely suppressive. This is why it is being developed as a potential male contraceptive right now, it is far more suppressive than LGD-4033. In the preclinical rat model, S23 suppressed LH levels by more than 50% after only 14 days with doses as low as 0.1 mg per day [R]. There are also reports of aggression with S23, as well as some strange side effects like dehydration and increased body temperature. While some hardcore recreational biohackers may opt to experiment with S23 because of all of the positive anecdotal experiences that can be found online, LGD-4033 is the more promising SARM at the moment overall. LGD-4033 Vs LGD-3303 LGD-3303 was hyped up as a superior alternative to LGD-4033, and in its preclinical model appeared to have some encouraging results. While it appears to still be in the preclinical stage, it is unclear if any developments have taken place since that first study, as it was completed over a decade ago in 2008. Anecdotally, LGD-4033 appears to be the candidate of choice among recreational users, with it consistently outperforming LGD-3303 mg:mg in lean muscle gains and strength gains. Some users swear by the efficacy of LGD-3303, so it shouldn't be written off entirely, but there is simply an overwhelming amount more evidence to support LGD-4033 as the superior SARM of the two. LGD-4033 Results (Anecdotal/Recreational Use) As shown in the clinical trials, LGD-4033 can increase lean muscle mass by 2.67 pounds within three weeks (on average) in young men at a dosage of 1 mg per day [R]. Predictably, LGD-4033 became a popular addition to athlete's regimens who were seeking performance enhancement. I have personally seen several very impressive transformations accomplished using only SARMs. Muscle Gains Gains upwards of 5-10 pounds of lean muscle mass are commonly reported among recreational users within a 4-8 week cycle. LGD-4033 is often referred to as the best mass building SARM, as it seems to exhibit greater muscle building potential than all other first-generation SARMs. Typically, it is incorporated into bulking phases where LGD-4033 is used to enhance strength and hypertrophy in conjunction with a calorie surplus. Users report some water retention with Ligandrol usage, however, I believe that this has more to do with body composition, daily water/potassium/sodium intake, caloric intake, cardio regimen (or lack thereof), and overall diet choices. However, predicting how much muscle an individual will gain from LGD-4033, or any anabolic agent for that matter, can vary wildly depending on a variety of factors. Strength Gains Substantial increases in strength are commonplace among recreational users as well. A handful of users have reported increases in strength of their flat barbell bench press, squat, and/or deadlift by as much as 100 pounds in a focused bulking phase. If a diet comprised of enough macronutrients, micronutrients and overall calories is adhered to for the duration of a LGD-4033 cycle, anecdotal reports suggest that gains of muscle upwards of 10 pounds and strength gains of 50-100 pounds on compound exercises are realistic. My LGD-4033 Review I've used LGD-4033 a handful of times, and my experience was fairly consistent with other anecdotal reports, but to a much lesser extreme. By the time I tried it, I already had several cycles of anabolic steroids under my belt, so I didn't expect it to really blow me away. My experience is less useful to reference as my body is already above and beyond my genetic limit via years of previous anabolics usage, however, I do believe that of all the SARMs, I feel that LGD-4033 had the greatest overall effect with the best side effect profile for me personally. I also didn't lose any hair from it, which to me is the number one draw of an anabolic agent. Once more data comes out on Ligandrol, I may start titrating my TRT down a bit more and start incorporating it in some capacity into a long-term regimen, as opposed to the way I've used it to date which is in intermittent “blast” phases. The only other compound I believe is formidable to LGD-4033 in regards to overall size and strength gains is S23, which is still in the preclinical stages and hasn't been trialed in humans yet. LGD-4033 Dosage Milligram : Milligram, LGD-4033 induces substantially more anabolic activity than any other viable SARM alternative, and even outperforms most anabolic steroids. The first Phase 1 study conducted on LGD-4033 established safety and tolerability of LGD-4033 up to dosages of 22 mg per day in humans. It is very unlikely that 22 mg per day will be necessary to replicate the anabolic properties of Testosterone to prevent the loss of lean muscle or bone mineral density in hip fracture patients, however, it is useful to know that it has established a fairly encouraging safety profile even at dosages as high as 22 mg. LGD-4033 produced dose-dependent effects on primary and all secondary measures of lean body mass, with significant increases in lean body mass and appendicular lean mass following 12 weeks of daily dosing. The highest dosage utilized in Phase 2 clinical trials was 2 mg per day for therapeutic purposes [R]. In a recreational capacity, it is quite common for men seeking performance enhancement to report using 10 – 20 mg of LGD-4033 per day, with women using 5 – 10 mg per day. These dosages were determined by recreational users based upon anecdotal logs and personal experimentation, and are not concrete guidelines that dictate correct or incorrect use. Side Effects While LGD-4033 was generally regarded as safe in human trials using dosages as high as 22 mg per day, that doesn't mean it had no negative side effects. These were some of the negative side effects reported in the clinical data, as well as anecdotally among recreational users. Decreased Good Cholesterol (HDL) The clinical data shows dose-dependent suppression of HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels with LGD-4033 usage [R]. A negative effect on HDL levels is consistently noted as a common side effect of all traditional anabolic steroids, and other SARMs. Despite SARMs ability to be selective about how they exert anabolic activity in the body, they evidently do not differ much from anabolic steroids in regards to their effects on lipid profiles. Testosterone Suppression SARMs have shown to suppress luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, thus decreasing testosterone in a dose-dependent manner [R]. Ligandrol suppressed Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) and total testosterone levels in clinical trials in a dose-dependent manner. Serum free testosterone and FSH levels were only suppressed in the subjects treated with 1 mg of Ligandrol [R]. There was no LH suppression in subjects treated with Ligandrol during the 21 day clinical trial conducted on healthy young men. However, the treated groups were only administered either 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, or 1.0 mg for three weeks, which are relatively low dosages and is also a short time frame. Based on the overwhelming supporting data on anabolic agents collected over the past 50 years, I believe it's safe to say that LGD-4033 will show blatant reductions in all of these hormone markers in a dose dependent manner, and the dosages in the studies just weren't high enough to consistently yield this data. At higher dosages (above 1 mg), I am sure serum free testosterone levels would drop considerably as the dose was titrated up, and other markers would decrease in parallel. Elevated Estrogen Or Decreased Estrogen LGD-4033 does not aromatize into Estrogen, however, by suppressing natural Testosterone levels it can create an unfavorable balance between Testosterone and Estrogen in the body. By occupying the androgen receptor with such a high affinity, LGD-4033 can divert a significant amount of Testosterone to aromatize into Estrogen that wouldn't have otherwise. The consequence of this is a systemic elevation of Estrogen levels in the body, which is commonly misinterpreted as prohormone laced SARMs. Common symptoms of high estrogen include:  Acne, oily skin Erectile dysfunction Low libido Lethargy Gynecomastia (man boobs) Irritability Depression Water retention High blood pressure Enlarged prostate Shrunken testicles Sugar cravings  While LGD-4033 can cause Estrogen levels to rise via the increased aromatization of circulating Testosterone, long-term use, or high dosages of LGD-4033 can cause an opposite effect, where the body has such a low level of circulating Testosterone via endocrine suppression that the body no longer has enough aromatization occurring to satisfy Estrogen fulfilled physiological functions. Low Estrogen levels can lead to a variety of health problems. Common symptoms of low estrogen include:  Dull weak orgasms Dry skin and lips Dehydration Erectile dysfunction Low libido Irritability Mood swings Loss of appetite Fatigue Lethargy Decreased bone mass and strength  Applications In Alternative Hormone Replacement Therapy In Men As Ligandrol does not aromatize into Estrogen, it would automatically be disqualified as a viable standalone hormone replacement therapy treatment for men. Estrogen serves several important functions in the male body, and those functions rely on a sufficient amount of Estrogen being produced via the aromatization of endogenous Estrogen. Low Estrogen side effects can be just as deleterious as high Estrogen side effects. In a hypothetical scenario where Ligandrol would be considered as a potential long-term HRT treatment, it would very likely need to be used in conjunction with exogenous Estrogen to maintain healthy blood serum concentrations that would have otherwise been achieved via adequate Testosterone to Estrogen aromatization. Androgenic Activity LGD-4033 exhibits a dose dependent increase in androgen activity in the body. While it is extremely selective for muscle tissue and bone relative to androgen affected tissues, all SARMs (LGD-4033 included) result in systemic increases in androgen activity, therefore there will still be some potential for androgenic side effects. The extent to which this will occur is just far less. As LGD-4033 has an anabolic:androgenic ratio of greater than 500:1, the therapeutic dose necessary to yield the desired level of muscle and bone mineral density retention in hip fracture patients would very likely not be high enough where any notable androgenic activity could occur. In a performance enhancement context, very high dosages would likely result in some notable androgenic side effects in the body. Hair Loss All androgens can cause hair follicle miniaturization, the extent to which they do this is dependent on their individual selectivity, binding affinity, and the dosage used. In general, therapeutic dosages of LGD-4033 should not cause any notable androgenic alopecia. However, this does not exclude temporary shedding (acute telogen effluvium) which can be triggered by a hormonal fluctuation. Any substantial shift in a man's hormone profile can cause hair roots to be pushed prematurely into the resting state. Any hormonal fluctuation, stressor, autoimmune response, deficiency or chemical imbalance can potentially cause a temporary shed. This is not to be confused with androgenic alopecia, which is permanent hair loss caused by androgen induced follicular miniaturization. Liver Toxicity LGD-4033 did not result in any significant changes in AST or ALT levels in human trials [R]. However, it should be noted that in a relevant clinical trial conducted on Ostarine (a SARM with an identical mechanism of action), short-lived increases in ALT to above the upper limit of normal were observed in eight subjects [R]. Taking this into consideration, it's entirely possible that LGD-4033 could potentially also exhibit some degree of liver toxicity at dosages higher than the 1 mg trialed where they assessed those health markers. At therapeutic dosages, there appears to be a strong safety profile and the data suggests a complete absence of liver toxicity. Lack Of Aromatization And 5-Alpha Reduction SARMs are resistant to metabolism by 5α-reductase and aromatase. The most potent androgen in the prostate is dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is formed by 5α-reduction of testosterone. 5α-reductase is expressed in high levels in the prostate, and very low levels in muscle tissue. A study that assessed how much of a role endogenous DHT plays when it comes to building muscle discovered that it literally does nothing for gains in muscle mass, and that the conversion of testosterone to DHT is not essential for mediating its anabolic effects on muscle [R]. This is contrary to what many people assumed, as DHT on is such a potent androgen. However, the fact that DHT is expressed in high levels in the prostate, but in low levels in muscle and bone, coupled with the data from that study, exhibits the true significance of DHT in prostate and testosterone in muscle and bone. Ligandrol does not undergo 5α-reduction, which is speculated to contribute to its sparing effect on the prostate and other androgen affected tissues. This is not the case though, as there are several androgens that do not undergo conversion to a more androgenic compound when undergo 5α-reduction. One of the most notable being MENT (Trestolone). Some androgens exhibit higher levels of androgenicity prior to 5α-reduction, and actually cause more androgenic side effects in the body when they are inhibited by 5α-reductase inhibitors. A prime example of this is the anabolic androgenic steroid Nandrolone.  Ligandrol is inherently selective for the androgen receptor, and its selectivity for muscle tissue and bone relative to prostate is not a result of its inability to be altered by 5α-reductase. Half-Life LGD-4033 displayed a prolonged elimination half-life (24–36 hours), linear pharmacokinetics, and predictable accumulation with multiple dosing [R].  There was a dose-proportional increase in LGD-4033 concentrations on days 1 and 21 because of its long half-life. Despite being reported to have a half-life of 24-36 hours, it would be wise for users to err on the side of caution and take into consideration that serum concentrations were nearly threefold higher on day 21 than on day 1 in the second Phase 1 trial. This means that once daily dosing will result in concentration build up of the compound over time, as 24 hours is not enough clearance time to assume that once daily dosing will equate to stable blood serum concentration levels [R]. PCT (Post Cycle Therapy) LGD-4033 will suppress natural Testosterone levels in a dose-dependent manner. I believe it is essential to complete a PCT phase (post-cycle therapy) after a LGD-4033 cycle. Due to the half-life of LGD-4033, PCT should be started the day after the last dosage was taken. Forgoing PCT may greatly increase the risk of muscle loss, fat gain, among all of the other standard side effects associated with Testosterone suppression. How much time off you should take after your PCT should be dictated by a variety of individual specific factors and blood work. I would not advise following the standard “time on = time off” equation.  Disclaimer: The information included in this article is intended for entertainment and informational purposes only.

Cardarine is purported by many recreational users to be the most effective endurance boosting chemical on the planet right now.

Cardarine, also known as GW501516, is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) agonist. Cardarine is commonly lumped into the same category as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) like Ostarine, but it is not a SARM at all. SARMs, like Ostarine, are androgen receptor ligands that stimulate androgen receptors in a selective way, whereby they induce a significantly greater amount of anabolic activity in the body relative to androgenic activity [R]. Cardarine was designed by Ligand Pharmaceuticals and GlaxoSmithKline in the 90's. It was initially intended as a potential treatment for metabolic diseases and cardiovascular diseases, but was ultimately abandoned in 2007 when animal testing revealed that it was either directly or indirectly related to the rapid development of cancerous tumors in multiple organs in both mice and rats [R]. Despite Cardarine's abandonment due to safety concerns, impressive performance enhancing benefits were noted in data that emerged from the tests. The results were widely discussed in popular media, which caught the attention of many athletes.  Individuals seeking a competitive edge started to use Cardarine to improve their endurance.  Recognizing this, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) developed a detection test for GW501516 and other related PPARδ modulators, and shortly thereafter in 2009 it was added to their prohibited substance list [R, R].  Cardarine Potential Clinical Applications Prior to 2007 (when Cardarine was abandoned), Cardarine was being investigated for its potential applications in treating metabolic diseases and cardiovascular diseases. After undergoing preclinical trials and examining Cardarine's efficacy, the scope of its potential therapeutic applications narrowed as targets were set for phase 1 clinical trials. The first target set was the treatment of hyperlipidemia, as Cardarine exhibited a profoundly positive reduction of triglycerides, fatty acids, VLDL, LDL, with a simultaneous increase in HDL (“good cholesterol”). Other studies focused on the treatment of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease occurred after 2003 on the back of positive results found in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials in 2000-2002. Had it not been for the studies revealing cancer development in mice and rats that were administered high doses of Cardarine, this chemical very likely would have progressed into further human trials, and perhaps even been approved for the treatment of a handful of metabolic disorders today. Mechanism Of Action Cardarine is a selective agonist of the PPARδ receptor. It has a high affinity and potency for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta [R].  Cardarine binds to PPARδ and recruits the coactivator PGC-1α. Via activating PPARδ, the liver switches its energy source from glucose to fatty acids, which can in turn reduce blood sugar levels [R]. This in turn upregulates the body's expression of proteins involved in energy expenditure, improves insulin sensitivity and body composition, which can lower the overall incidence of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease [R, R].  Naturally, the first thing people started to associate Cardarine with is “exercise in a pill”. Exercise mimetics would obviously be an extremely attractive alternative for many individuals, and delving further into the GW501516 data supports that the activation of PPARδ can in fact replicate many of the benefits gained from exercise itself. Increased energy, muscle building potential, insulin sensitivity, fat burning potential, endurance, and improved lipid profiles are the most notable benefits that Cardarine has exhibited in testing via its selective activation of PPARδ [R]. Despite the array of blatant health benefits, Cardarine was ultimately dubbed a “failed exercise mimetic” as it was shown to promote cancer cell growth in animal studies [R, R]. Cardarine Clinical Trials Preclinical Rat And Mice Models In rats and mice treated with Cardarine, increased fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle and protection against diet-induced obesity and type II diabetes was observed. In a metabolomic study of Cardarine for enhancing running endurance in Kunming mice, significant improvements were noted in the treated mice. Cardarine treatment enhanced running endurance and the proportion of SDH-positive muscle fibres in both trained and untrained mice [R]. The effects of GW501516 on SDH-positive fibres in skeletal muscle of sedentary and trained KM mice The increased running performance in Kunming (KM) mice occurred regardless of training, and the magnitude of improvement between both trained and sedentary treated mice was surprisingly high [R]. Running distance nearly doubled in the mice treated with Cardarine. The effects of GW501516 on running performance in sedentary and trained KM mice. Forced wheel running endurance tests were performed following 3 weeks of treatment. (a) shows the total distance ran by mice in each group. Other data further supports that PPARδ activation can regulate muscle fiber specification, and produce profound increases in long-distance endurance [R]. Other preclinical rodent models noted less commonly referred to benefits that should still be noted as they could have significant potential therapeutic applications in a clinical setting.  Cardarine lowered inflammation in mice [R, R, R] Cardrine improved blood flow in mice by increasing nitric oxide levels, which can help prevent blood clots and other detrimental cardiovascular complications, as well as improve wound healing [R, R, R] PPARδ activation via Cardarine may help reverse obesity and diabetes by increasing total oxidative metabolism in white adipose tissue [R, R] Cardarine significantly improved insulin sensitivity in mice, which is one of the main precursors to diabetes, obesity, heart disease and cancer. Improving blood glucose metabolism and preventing insulin resistance is one of the most important factors when it comes to maximizing vitality and longevity [R, R].  Preclinical Primate Model A preclinical trial was conducted on obese rhesus monkeys, as they have a lipid profile that closely matches humans. Cardarine increased HDL cholesterol, lowered LDL cholesterol, and reduced serum insulin levels [R]. No adverse effects were noted, and all health outcomes of this trial were positive. The data in this preclinical model suggests that Cardarine could potentially be a very strong candidate in a clinical setting for lowering the occurrence of heart disease associated with metabolic syndrome [R]. The number 1 killer of humans that can be controlled via diet, exercise and chemical enhancement is heart disease, and any advancements in the niche of cardiovascular disease prevention would likely be a huge benefit for every one. While Cardarine certainly wouldn't have been a complete fix for insulin resistance, inflammation, and arterial plaque build up, the data suggests that it potentially could've given patients a fairly significant edge in recalibrating their bodies to an insulin sensitive state with a more balanced lipid profile [R]. Phase 1 Trials Two early Phase 1 trials in healthy subjects demonstrated the efficacy of Cardarine in reducing Triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, apoB and insulin levels and improving HDL cholesterol and insulin sensitivity [R, R]. First Phase 1 Human Trial The first clinical trial was conducted on 24 healthy men for 2 weeks. Each volunteer was either given placebo, 2.5 mg Cardarine, or 10 mg Cardarine per day. Cardarine significantly improved HDL Cholesterol levels and reduced Triglycerides [R]. These lipid profile improvements are a result of Cardarine's ability to induce the upregulation of human skeletal muscle fat utilization, ABCA1 expression and enhanced serum fat clearance rates. A fat feeding study was conducted where subjects were fed a high-fat breakfast on days 0 and 13 of the study 1 hour after taking their daily Cardarine dosage. Triglyceride analysis was performed to assess how much (if at all) Cardarine would influence how efficiently the body processed those fats and how much nutrient partitioning in general was enhanced. Lipolytic activity was gauged to assess the efficacy of Cardarine relative to placebo and the data revealed that the placebo group's Triglyceride levels went up significantly from high-fat meals, and the 2.5 mg and 10 mg treated groups both respectively lowered Triglyceride levels, even in the presence of the fat dense meals.  Cardarine was shown to be safe and well-tolerated during this trial [R]. Subjects treated with Cardarine did not experience any significant adverse effects, including muscle and liver responses. Liver enzymes and muscle proteins were measured to assess any potentially negative effects deriving from Cardarine. None were found. Second Phase 1 Human Trial Most notably, the second Phase 1 trial found that Cardarine significantly reduced hepatic fat content by 20% [R]. The preclinical rodent models where over-expression of PPARδ was stimulated with Cardarine suggest improvements in metabolic syndrome reversal via enhanced fat oxidation in skeletal muscle. This second phase 1 clinical trial sought out to replicate this result in humans. 10 mg per day was given to six healthy, moderately overweight subjects for 2 weeks. Treatment with Cardarine showed statistically significant reductions in fasting plasma triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, LDL cholesterol, and insulin [R]. HDL cholesterol remained unchanged.  A 20% reduction in liver fat content and a 30% reduction in urinary isoprostanes were also noted [R].   The relative proportion of exhaled Carbon dioxide from the fat content of the meal was increased as a result of Cardarine administration, and skeletal muscle expression of CPT1b was also significantly increased [R].  Cardarine successfully reversed multiple abnormalities associated with metabolic syndrome without increasing oxidative stress (one of the only negative side effects found in mega-dosed preclinical animal studies) [R]. The results of this second phase 1 trial looked very promising for potential therapeutic applications in a clinical setting to treat metabolic syndrome. Phase 2 Trials First Phase 2 Human Trial The first phase 2 trial intended to examine the effect of Cardarine on lipoprotein metabolism. The trial was conducted on 13 dyslipidemic men with central obesity who were administered with placebo or 2.5 mg of Cardarine per day. The results confirmed Cardarine's lipid-modifying effects in dyslipidemic subjects with abdominal obesity, and also provided evidence of its effects in modulating lipoprotein kinetics (increase in catabolism of VLDL and pro- duction of apoA-I and apoA-II; decrease in production of apoC-III and LDL-apoB) [R]. GW501516 was also associated with a decrease in cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity but had no effect on insulin resistance [R]. Mean VLDL, IDL, LDL, and HDL triglyceride (A) and cholesterol (B) content ± SEM during placebo (closed square) and GW501516 (open square). The first phase 2 trial results further supported Cardarine's potential as a treatment of dyslipidemia in obesity [R]. Second Phase 2 Human Trial In the second phase 2 trial, Cardarine or placebo was administered to 268 patients with low HDL cholesterol levels for 12 weeks [R]. Dosages of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg were administered to the treated patients. A second smaller exploratory study in a similar population was conducted on 37 patients using a sequence of 5 and 10 mg dosing for the assessment of lipoprotein particle concentration [R]. Olson et al. reported that Cardarine treatment in this trial was associated with significant improvements in multiple lipid profile components (TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, free fatty acids and apoB, apoA-I and apoA-II) and a shift in LDL particle size from small dense to larger, less dense particles [R]. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response over time by treatment group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) response over time by treatment group. Free fatty acid (FFA) response over time by treatment group. Despite the promising results found in Cardarine's preclinical, phase 1 and phase 2 trials, the further investigation and development of it was discontinued after observations in a couple rodent models found rapid cancer cell growth in the liver, stomach, tongue, skin, bladder, ovaries, womb and testes [R, R].  Cardarine Results (Anecdotal/Recreational Reports) Endurance Cardarine stimulates fatty acid metabolism and suppresses glucose catabolism without negatively affecting mitochondrial content or muscle fiber type. By sparing glucose in the body, Cardarine delays the onset of hypoglycemia during exercise and substantially improves running times and overall endurance. The massive boost in endurance is without a doubt the number one reported benefit of Cardarine, and it isn’t uncommon for users to rave about how their endurance feels like it has gone up 25-30% shortly after taking it. Expectedly, athletes in endurance sports using Cardarine report very favorable outcomes in their performance. Cardarine is unique in that it is one of the few chemicals suited more to enhancing athletic performance in a sports setting, rather than in a bodybuilding capacity.  Athletes commonly report a very substantial increase in their ability to push past endurance plateaus where they would normally gas out. Greater output in the gym, less required rest time, better running times, better hiking times, even better endurance in bed are all things commonly reported by recreational Cardarine users. Fat Burning Greatly accelerated fat loss is a commonly reported benefit of Cardarine, however, I believe it is far less potent than what some articles imply. Anecdotally, I have yet to see any evidence of substantially increased fat loss derived solely from Cardarine. By stimulating fatty acid oxidation via increasing glucose uptake, your body will resort majorly to stored fat as its energy source, and in turn improve fat burning potential. This is what Cardarine aims to accomplish, and I believe to some extent it does, however, it is not a game changer in a bodybuilding context. Muscle Growth While Cardarine evidently exhibits some anti-catabolic properties, it does not yield significant hypertrophy in a bodybuilding context. While it likely could be an effective tool for staving off fat gain, I do not believe that Cardarine has any substantial muscle building properties in humans. My Cardarine Review I feel that the fat burning capabilities of Cardarine are exaggerated and are typically only found in articles written by individuals who want to convince you to buy it. Personally, I feel that Cardarine proves most useful as a cardiovascular endurance aid, or a modulator of lipids. For all other purposes (fat loss, muscle growth, etc.) I feel like it falls short of it being worth using when we don't have definitive human data to conclude that it is definitely not going to accelerate cancer cell growth. Do I think it causes cancer at commonly used dosages? Based on what I've learned I think it is unlikely, however, I don't compete in endurance sports, nor do I feel the need to artificially boost my current endurance. I do see very promising potential benefits in regards to its effects on insulin sensitivity and lipids, as chronically low HDL levels are extremely common among bodybuilders, even those on low TRT dosages. With that being said, I still see it as a last resort even when it comes to lipids management. My educated guess is that even synthetic GH usage (commonly used in bodybuilding without considering the implications) would probably be a far more risky cancer causing agent than Cardarine, but obviously the less things that can potentially cause cancer cell proliferation in your body the better. I do not use Cardarine myself, and probably will not use it unless my HDL levels prove to be a significant detriment to my health long term, in which case I may consider it for lipids modulation. Cardarine Dosage Doses of 2.5 – 10 mg per day were used for up to 12 weeks in clinical trials. Anecdotally, users report improved outcomes at a daily dosage of 10 – 20 mg per day with no serious adverse effects. Half-Life Cardarine's half-life was never revealed in the clinical data, however, in all human trials a once per day dosing frequency was used. Based on that, we can assume that the half-life of Cardarine is ~ 24 hours. Cardarine remains detectable in urine up to 40 days after a single oral dose of 15 mg [R]. Side Effects Does Cardarine Cause Cancer? At the 48th Annual Meeting of the Society of Toxicology in 2009 (2 years after Cardarine's abandonment), data was presented showing that Cardarine caused cancer to develop rapidly in several organs in animal testing [R]. The first thing to note is the fact that the aforementioned study involved administering Cardarine to Han Wistar rats for almost 2 years straight (1.99 years to be exact). Without being administered any chemicals at all, the median life expectancy of Han Wistar rats is between 30 and 33 months for females, and between 33 and 36 months for males. The reason for their short life expectancy is the number of adenocarcinomas that they develop [R]. Prior to even looking at the animal models for Cardarine, we know that these rats are not expected to live longer than 3 years already, irrespective of what they are administered, due to their high probability of developing cancer. The dosages administered to rats over the 2 year study varied widely. The lowest dosage showing cancer cell proliferation in an animal model being 3 mg/kg/day in Han Wistar rats for a period of 104 weeks [R]. The average weight of a Han Wistar rat is 509 grams, or 0.509 kg [R]. Average body weight of male Wistar rats The following equation is used to calculate roughly what that dosage would equate to in humans: HED (mg / kg = Animal NOAEL mg/kg) × (Weightanimal [kg]/Weighthuman [kg])(1–0.67) [R]. Assuming we have an 80 kg man that we are using for this calculation, we get the following result: Human Equivalent Dose = (3) × (0.509/80)(1–0.67) Human Equivalent Dose = (3) x (0.0063625)(0.33) Human Equivalent Dose = 3 x 0.18845044723 Human Equivalent Dose = 0.5653513417 mg/kg Human Equivalent Dose For An 80 Kilogram Man = 45.2281073363 mg Recreationally, the standard dosage is between 10 – 20 mg per day, which is not incredibly far off from the minimum human equivalent dosage to yield accelerated cancer development in the aforementioned rodent model. Anecdotally, Cardarine has been shown to be generally well tolerated. A study examined the effect of ligand activation of PPARβ/δ on cell proliferation, cell cycle kinetics, and target gene expression in human HaCaT keratinocytes using Cardarine and found that ligand activation of PPARβ/δ inhibits keratinocyte proliferation through PPARβ/δ-dependent mechanisms [R]. Keratinocyte carcinoma (skin cancer) is by far the most common cancer in the United States [R]. The ligand activation study provides strong data to support that Cardarine has the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth, rather than accelerate it. In addition, in all of the clinical studies conducted on humans using dosages as high as 10 mg per day for 12 weeks, no serious adverse effects or cancer development was reported [R, R, R]. As of now, there is zero evidence to support that Cardarine use at the dosages used in human trials will cause cancer, however, it is certainly still possible. Potentially Increased Cell Death Reducing oxidative stress may increase protection from cell death, therefore measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels may be a way to track cell death progression, or lack thereof. CCl4-treated hepatocytes incubated with KD3010 (another PPARδ agonist) had reduced levels of ROS, whereas hepatocytes incubated with GW501516 showed more ROS production. Via increasing ROS production, Cardarine increased starvation-induced cell death in cultured hepatocytes and exacerbated liver damage [R]. How Does Cardarine Stack Up To Other Endurance Boosting Chemicals Cardarine Vs SR9009 SR9009 (also known as Stenabolic) is a synthetic Rev-ErbA ligand, not a SARM, although it is very commonly lumped into the SARMs category. SR9009 works by increasing the mitochondria count in the muscles, resulting in a blatant improvement in endurance. It causes no testosterone suppression, and there are no serious adverse events reported to date from SR9009 usage. SR9009 has very poor bioavailability, making it useless in comparison to orally administered Cardarine, however, when SR9009 was injected into mice the results were very promising [R]. Pharmacological activation of Rev-erb-α substantially increased the running capacity and mitochondrial respiration of the mice in the preclinical model [R]. Yielding any performance outcomes with SR9009 would need to be achieved via injection only, as oral administration has proved an extremely low level of bioavailability, and there are no current human trials. Anecdotally, we can only assume that Cardarine has a greater overall efficacy profile than SR9009, however, this may not be the case, as the very few cases of intravenously administered SR9009 have reportedly yielded positive outcomes (do not try this obviously). Cardarine Vs EPO Recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone produced by the interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney that signal for erythropoiesis in bone marrow. One of the main effects of EPO is increased red blood cell production and the elevation of hematocrit levels. EPO became a heavily abused drug by amateur and professional cyclists because of its ability to significantly improve exercise performance [R]. Serious adverse events are reported far more often with EPO than with Cardarine. While there has never been a clinical study comparing its efficacy and safety profile to Cardarine (and there likely never will), EPO is significantly more dangerous in both the short and long term. Arterial hypertension, cerebral convulsion/hypertensive encephalopathy, thrombo-embolism, iron deficiency and influenza-like syndrome have all been commonly reported adverse events occurring with long term EPO usage [R]. To date, there are no adverse events that have been reported in human trials with Cardarine. Keep in mind, the sample size of those human trials is small, and long term evaluations of those individuals have not been made to establish long term cancer risk. In a performance enhancing context, you would be hard-pressed to find someone who believes EPO is a safer alternative to Cardarine. Cardarine Vs Equipoise Equipoise (Boldenone) is an anabolic androgenic steroid that is unique in that it stimulates the release of erythropoietin in the kidneys notably more so than other steroids [R]. Anything that increases red blood cell count and hematocrit will increase the potential for improved endurance during exercise, however, this comes with the risk of a myriad of dangerous cardiovascular outcomes. Equipoise will also shut down natural testosterone production for the duration of its use, which is obviously not ideal for individuals who don't want to trade endocrine shutdown for an endurance boost. Equipoise usage would need to be followed up with a PCT phase, whereas Cardarine and EPO wouldn't as they do not suppress endocrine function. The mechanism of action by which Cardarine improves endurance is completely different than Equipoise, or EPO, and we can surmise has an overall greater safety profile both short term and long term. With that being said, none of these chemicals are without risk. PCT (Post Cycle Therapy) Cardarine does not cause endocrine suppression, it doesn't lower natural testosterone levels, and it doesn't inhibit LH, FSH or SHBG. It does not raise estrogen either, which has an indirect effect on testosterone suppression. As Cardarine doesn't suppress any sex hormones, or increase any antagonizing hormones, there is no hormonal suppression that occurs via Cardarine use, and therefore would not require a PCT phase. If a suppressive anabolic steroid or SARM was used concurrently with Cardarine, then that would require PCT. Cardarine Used With Trenbolone To Offset Loss Of Cardiovascular Endurance Trenbolone is notorious for severely crushing cardiovascular endurance and making it incredibly hard to complete sufficient cardio activity without getting winded extremely easily. Cardarine has become very popular as of recent with Tren users as it is reported to mitigate the Tren cardio side effect, allowing the user to keep their endurance in top form while concurrently running Tren.

If any hair loss occurred as a result of Ibutamoren usage, it would be temporary shedding, not the progression of male pattern baldness. Tingly fingers/hands, elevated blood sugar, intense dreams, some lethargy, water retention, as well as increased appetite is the extent of the side effects I am aware of. Are the gains from Ibutamoren maintainable after coming off of it? Yes, the gains are very maintainable as it has no negative impact on your natural testosterone or natural GH production. Does timing matter when I take the Ibutamoren dose each day? IGF-1 levels will remain elevated for up to 24 hours after taking a single oral dose of Ibutamoren, so once per day dosing is fine. However, after taking MK-677 GH levels will drastically spike, which may cause lethargy. Taking this into consideration, I always opt to use it pre-bed so I'm not lethargic at work or during my day time activities. How does Ibutamoren work? After ingestion, MK-677 signals the pituitary gland to secrete more growth hormone. One common misconception is the assumption that MK-677 causes an increase in the quantity of daily GH pulsations. What actually happens is that it increases the strength of each pulsation of GH from the pituitary gland, consequently increasing the body's total 24 hour GH production amount. GH then stimulates the liver to produce Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1). How does Ibutamoren compare to injectable GH and peptides? I’ve personally seen IGF-1 levels in several different individuals’ blood work (the most accurate method of determining GH levels within the body) taking Ibutamoren reaching the equivalent of at least a 3-4 IU daily dose of growth hormone. These results were achieved at a fraction of the cost of exogenous GH (literally 1/20th of the cost). In contrast to peptides, Ibutamoren gives the same benefits but doesn’t cause pituitary desensitization like other GHRP’s do, doesn’t need to be injected, and is cheaper. In short, Ibutamoren is as strong as injectable GH and peptides, but is much cheaper, doesn’t need to be stored in a fridge to prevent degradation, and doesn’t need to be injected. Of all the various GH elevating compounds at our disposal, Ibutamoren is easily pound for pound the best bang for your buck. Do I need to cycle Ibutamoren? There is no shutdown of natural GH production with Ibutamoren, nor is there a need for PCT, but it should be cycled unless it was being used for the therapeutic treatment of growth hormone deficiency. The first reason being that Ibutamoren will increase blood glucose levels, which can contribute to insulin resistance long-term (just like GH or peptides). The second reason being that Ibutamoren seems to have a diminishing returns effect. There are clinical studies showing a drastic spike in GH and IGF-1 levels up to the end of the first month, with a slow gradual decline in benefit over the next 11 months of the year. There are other studies that exhibit this diminishing returns effect occurring at the 6 month mark, with the same slow gradual decline thereafter. And then there are some studies not showing this diminishing returns effect at all. Despite the limited data, the fact remains that Ibutamoren is a GH secretagogue, meaning the mechanism by which it functions is mediated through the pituitary gland which has a negative feedback loop to prevent the body from secreting too much GH. It is plausible to assume that eventually the body will facilitate counter measures to bring GH and IGF-1 levels back down to baseline. There is also some data that suggests that chronic ghrelin secretion may have a negative effect on stress response pathways in the brain long-term. Although the supporting data is weak, cautious individuals should cycle Ibutamoren regardless. I personally wouldn't use it for more than 6 months straight, and that would be much less if I had issues managing blood sugar. If you're going to use it, get a baseline fasting blood sugar average by checking it upon waking on an empty stomach before consuming anything. If you already have moderately high or high fasting blood glucose levels, I wouldn't even touch Ibutamoren (or GH) until those levels were brought to a more optimal level via lifestyle changes, diet changes, and/or insulin sensitizing agents. If you do use it, monitor blood sugar closely, and if you start noticing that you have chronically high blood sugar, it may be wise to cycle off, or just not use it at all. The number one cause of type 2 Diabetes in bodybuilding is excessive carbohydrate consumption in conjunction with growth hormone abuse. Those individuals likely never monitored their blood sugar levels at all. If you are going to use GH, a secretagogue, peptides, or anything that spikes GH/IGF-1, you should have a blood glucose monitor that you use regularly to ensure you aren't slowly inducing insulin resistance. What can I expect from Ibutamoren results wise? A rapid increase in muscular fullness, size, and improved sleep quality is commonly reported among Ibutamoren users. It isn’t uncommon for individuals to gain up to 10-15 pounds, with almost half of that coming on substantially quickly in the first couple weeks. It is a very dramatic compound and the results are very noticeable. With that being said, do not misinterpret all of this weight as muscle tissue. The main benefit GH has on body composition is improved nutrient partitioning, lipolysis, and increased muscular fullness facilitated via increased nitrogen and intramuscular water retention. Despite the scale jumping up and the mass added looking lean, a very small amount of that (if any) would be literal muscle tissue. A very obvious effect that is fairly typical is that sleep quality dramatically improves and REM sleep is easier to achieve. An improvement of complexion, energy levels and immune system is a commonly reported benefit as well. Can Ibutamoren Suppress Your Natural GH Production? Ibutamoren inherently upregulates natural growth hormone production. Despite it being an exogenous compound, the way it works is by stimulating the pituitary gland to secrete more growth hormone via the same mechanism it naturally would anyways. All secretions of GH that occur with Ibutamoren in the body are natural, they are just amplified in strength. There is no evidence to support that taking Ibutamoren will inhibit natural GH secretion events after discontinuing it. Can Ibutamoren be used for cutting or bulking? While you can cut or bulk on Ibutamoren, I generally advise bulking with it as it definitely has a tendency to drastically increase your appetite, making it extremely hard to cut down without an appetite suppressant. If you want to cut down and get shredded on Ibutamoren I highly suggest you get a potent appetite suppressant as Ibutamoren will almost certainly increase your appetite significantly. Can Ibutamoren counter the catabolic effects of T3? It will absolutely help prevent catabolism caused by t3. I'm not guaranteeing you won't lose any muscle as t3 can be VERY catabolic at high enough doses, but it will definitely help keep a lot of muscle on you you would otherwise lose. There is a study that exhibits how T3 actually completely negated the nitrogen retaining benefits GH provides, so that in itself should exemplify just how catabolic T3 can be. Effects of long-term growth hormone (GH) and triiodothyronine (T3) administration on functional hepatic nitrogen clearance in normal man. Is Ibutamoren A SARM like Ostarine or LGD-4033? No, it is a potent GH Secretagogue. It is non-steroidal, and it is not a SARM either despite popular belief. A GH Secretagogue is a substance that signals the pituitary gland to secrete more growth hormone. Would Taking A SARM With It Increase My Results? Stacking Ibutamoren with a SARM would undoubtedly increase muscle growth potential. While Ibutamoren is a GH Secretagogue stimulating the pituitary gland, SARMs operate exclusively on the androgen receptor. As such, stacking it with a SARM like Ostarine or LGD-4033 would essentially be like stacking HGH with a low dose of Testosterone. As you would expect, more muscle growth potential and a more drastic change in overall body composition could be achieved with a combination of the two, rather than one or the other on their own. How do increased HGH and IGF-1 levels from the MK-677 benefit me? HGH promotes and increases the synthesis of new protein tissues, allowing new muscle to be built. It metabolizes fat incredibly well, improves complexion, has dramatic anti-aging properties, increases hair growth (where you want it). It improves sleeping patterns (making for fewer unintended awakenings and better REM-stage sleep), it produces more energy, it may improve sexual performance, it builds stronger bones and it improves the quality and duration of heart and kidneys. IGF-1 supports cellular division (the only hormone that can actually create brand new muscle cells via muscular cell division), repairs nerve damage, lowers body fat levels, and also exhibits anti-aging properties by tightening up loose skin, healing old injuries, as well as healing bones, tendons and ligaments. How safe is it? Ibutamoren has a promising safety profile based on all of the clinical data to date. A 2 year clinical study of using Ibutamoren every single day at a dose of 25mg concluded that “daily administration of Ibutamoren significantly increased growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor I levels to those of healthy young adults without serious adverse effects. The ghrelin mimetic Ibutamoren enhanced pulsatile growth hormone secretion, significantly increased fat-free mass, and was generally well tolerated” Effects of an oral ghrelin mimetic on body composition and clinical outcomes in healthy older adults: a randomized trial Are there any supplements I need to take with Ibutamoren? Using 200 mcg Huperzine A 3 times per day may enhance the effects of Ibutamoren. There is some data that suggests that Huperzine A may inhibit Somatostatin in the body. Somatostatin is the body's counter measure to prevent HGH levels from getting too high. Sort of like Myostatin's effect on inhibiting muscle growth. Huperzine A may be able to inhibit Somatostatin, consequently freeing up more free/usable HGH. Taking the Huperzine A will keep Somatostatin from inhibiting your pituitary released GH from the Ibutamoren. While the evidence to support this is weak, Huperzine A is a great Nootropic and is very cheap, so I use it daily anyways just in case. It has several benefits in its own right irrelevant to Somatostatin inhibition. Using an insulin sensitizing agent like Berberine to keep blood sugar in check would also be something that could be very beneficial to use with Ibutamoren. How long does Ibutamoren take to start working? Ibutamoren starts working right away as the terminal half-life is 4.7 hours. The drastic increase in GH levels will occur very quickly after ingestion, and usually by the end of the first week there is already a fairly substantial change in body composition due to the quick boost in intramuscular water and nitrogen retention it causes. Do I need to take PCT after taking MK-677? No, there is no PCT necessary as it doesn’t suppress natural testosterone levels, nor does it affect your natural GH production. Does it need to be taken on an empty stomach? No, having food in your stomach won’t affect the absorption at all.

RAD140 is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) currently under development by Radius Health, Inc. for potential use in treating muscle wasting disorders and hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. There are several unofficial slang terms for RAD140 in the fitness community, one of the most popular being “Testolone”. RAD140 has all of the hallmarks of an effective SARM, exhibiting a high affinity for the androgen receptor with tissue selective anabolic effects in muscle in bone, with a relatively minimal effect on prostate, seminal vesicles, and other androgen affected tissues [R]. RAD140 has a high level of oral bioavailability and demonstrated high in vivo tolerability [R]. It is still in the preclinical stages with recruitment occurring right now into its first phase 1 human trial, and has yet to be tested on humans [R]. In addition, it is often referred to as a potential alternative to testosterone replacement therapy in the recreational bodybuilding community. Its potential efficacy in a hormone replacement therapy context is implied in some of the preclinical animal data, but the scientists also acknowledge the potential limitations of RAD140 when considering it being used in this capacity.  Its lack of aromatization is all that is needed to make a definitive judgment on its overall efficacy profile as a hormone replacement therapy alternative, which I will delve into later. Recreational users are quick to label RAD140 as the “safe non-steroidal version of testosterone.”  This is because it doesn't require injections and hasn't exhibited any notable side effects in its preclinical data. Obviously with no human data, it is extremely presumptuous to make a statement like this, and later in the article I will delve further into the limitations of RAD140, and SARMs in general. RAD140 is purported by many to be a very versatile SARM that provides a complete replacement for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), without any of the side effects.  Mechanism Of Action RAD140 doesn’t require any injections as it has a high level of oral bioavailability [R]. After ingestion, RAD140 binds to androgen receptors in different tissues in the body which a high level of selectivity. After binding to the androgen receptors, RAD140 exerts tissue-specific anabolic effects in muscle tissue and bone, and neuroprotective androgen-like effects in the brain, with a relative lack of stimulation in prostate and seminal vesicles [R]. RAD140 is a potent androgen agonist in the levator ani, and is also a much weaker partial antagonist on the seminal vesicles and possibly the prostate. RAD140 demonstrated excellent affinity for the androgen receptor (Ki = 7 nM) [R]. To put this in perspective, the affinity for the androgen receptor for Testosterone in this preclinical model was 29 nM, and 10 nM for DHT. In other words, RAD140 has a greater affinity to bind to the androgen receptor than Testosterone and DHT. RAD140 does not aromatize into Estrogen, and does not undergo 5-alpha reduction into a more androgenic metabolite. One thing that needs to be noted is RAD140's preclinical characterization referring to it as a “partial antagonist” in androgen affected tissues [R]. While this implies it is much less androgenic than all other SARMs, this is not necessarily the case. Most other SARMs are classified as “partial agonists” in androgen affected tissues, and while RAD140 is classified in its preclinical profile as a partial antagonist, partial agonists may also be considered ligands which display both agonistic and antagonistic effects in affected tissues [R]. This is important because at a first glance the majority of readers will assume that RAD140 is the only SARM that has antagonistic effects on the prostate gland, and is therefore the most viable candidate for SARM therapy to date, which is not necessarily the case. All androgen receptor ligands that have extremely selective functions indicative of a SARM have demonstrated partial agonist activity in the prostate gland, RAD140 included, despite what its preclinical profile may imply. RAD140 Effects Increases Muscle Mass RAD140 is very potent at low dosages and exhibited a mean weight gain of more than 10% in 28 days at only 0.1 mg/kg in a preclinical primate model [R].  In a preclinical rodent model assessing the efficacy of RAD140 in comparison to exogenous Testosterone Propionate, RAD140 significantly outperformed Testosterone in myotrophic/androgenic selectivity.  In this study, rats were castrated and either given placebo, 1 mg/kg of Testosterone Propionate or graded dosages of either 0.03 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of RAD140. The “sham” group are untreated rats that weren't castrated that serve as a reference guide for how much anabolic/androgenic activity occurs in a normal healthy rat with normal endogenous Testosterone and DHT levels. After castrating the rats, muscle mass and prostate size decrease because there is no longer sufficient androgen stimulation occurring in the body, as there is no Testosterone or DHT being produced. By using RAD140 or Testosterone, this study exhibits exactly how effective these two compounds are at replicating the anabolic activity necessary to maintain normal amounts of muscle and bone mass, and how much androgenic activity will occur in the prostate relative to that. By referring to the figure above you can see that the lowest dosage of RAD140 capable of maintaining normal levels of anabolic activity in the body was the 0.3 mg/kg treated group. While Testosterone at 1 mg/kg was able to outperform the 0.3 mg/kg RAD140 group in muscle growth, it stimulated prostate growth as well to a much greater extent. For therapeutic purposes, RAD140 exhibits a greater efficacy profile at low dosages than Testosterone, as it's able to maintain normal amounts of muscle mass, but greatly decrease the amount of androgenic activity in the body. The 3 mg/kg RAD140 treated group was able to replicate the same level of muscle tissue growth as the 1 mg/kg Testosterone treated group, with about half of the androgenic activity in the prostate. It would be interesting to see how the same Testosterone treated group would respond if they were given Dutasteride to inhibit the 5-alpha reduction of Testosterone into DHT, and if that group would still exhibit a less favorable selectivity than the RAD140 groups. For all we know, it could be more beneficial to use Testosterone concurrently with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor rather than RAD140, especially considering Testosterone aromatizes into Estrogen, which is a severely limiting flaw of SARMs in general, but that all remains to be seen. In a therapeutic context, RAD140 looks very promising based on the preclinical data given, and it blatantly has the ability to selectively increase muscle tissue, even at supraphysiological levels. Fat Loss No direct fat loss was noted in the preclinical trials conducted on RAD140, however, as a human accrues more muscle mass, their basal metabolic rate will increase in parallel. This is a given, therefore anything that can increase lean muscle mass in a human would theoretically increase total daily energy expenditure. The net result of that would be an increase in the amount of calories expended just by having more muscle tissue via RAD140 usage, and greater overall fat loss. Therefore, it is very likely that RAD140 can indirectly increase fat loss to some extent, dependent on the amount of muscle growth it induces. Increases Bone Mineral Density All SARMs that have reached human trials have shown the ability to inhibit bone turnover, stimulate bone formation, and retain bone mineral density in a state of catabolism [R]. While RAD140 hasn't gone into human testing yet, its tissue selective anabolic effects in bone have been demonstrated in preclinical animal models [R]. As exemplified via other more thoroughly studied SARMs like Ostarine and LGD-4033, these effects will very likely translate in humans just the same in further clinical trials. Reduces Prostate Size RAD140 has proven capable of exhibiting tissue selective anabolic effects in muscle and bone equivalent to that of a therapeutic dosage of Testosterone while simultaneously reducing prostate size by approximately 70% [R]. RAD140 has a much lower level of androgenicity in the body and simultaneously suppresses natural Testosterone production. The net result of this in hypogonadal males would be a fulfilment of Testosterone's important functions, with a lack of androgenic activity. The net result of this in healthy males with normal testosterone levels would be a drastic decrease in prostate size and androgenic activity, in parallel to natural testosterone suppression. The reason being that healthy men still operate with a significant amount of androgenic activity occurring via their natural Testosterone production and its 5-alpha reduction to DHT. When a healthy male has their endocrine system suppressed, they will produce less Testosterone (and consequently DHT as well), which will cause a dose dependent decrease in muscle size, bone mineral density, prostate size and the size of seminal vesicles. This is what makes RAD140 and other SARMs so interesting, as they will suppress the endocrine system and can reduce systemic androgenic activity, while keep anabolic activity exactly the same, or even increasing it to supraphysiological levels, depending on the dosage used. There are a variety of therapeutic applications in which a very selective potent agonist in muscle tissue with a far lower level of androgenic activity would be beneficial in a clinical setting, with just one of those being a potentially viable treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men. Neurodegenerative Disease Protection SARMs target androgen receptors in different areas of the body, and RAD140 has also shown neuroprotective effects in the brain of androgen deficient rats [R]. Endogenous androgens are responsible for several important functions in the body and brain, the majority of which are mediated via androgen receptor activation [R]. In hormonally deficient rats RAD140 activated those androgen receptors in the brain and prevented neurodegenerative disease progression from occurring in the absence of sufficient endogenous androgens. RAD140 was able to activate androgen receptors in the brain, protect hippocampal neurons from cell death, and induce anabolic activity in muscle tissue and bone as effectively as Testosterone, all with a near complete absence of stimulation in androgen affected reproductive tissues [R]. Suppresses Breast Cancer The androgen receptor is frequently expressed in many estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, ER-negative, and triple-negative breast cancers. As RAD140 facilitates its effects via the androgen receptor, assessing its potential clinical applications in this context was worth exploring. In a preclinical study RAD140 significantly suppressed the growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells in in vivo and in vitro models of AR/ER+ breast cancer [R]. RAD140 has a promising preclinical profile, and Radius Health is currently in the process of recruiting 40 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer into its first phase 1 clinical trial on humans [R]. The main goal of the study is to evaluate its safety profile, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic characteristics in hormone receptor positive breast cancer. RAD140 Pipeline RAD140 Clinical Trials Phase 1 One Phase 1 study on RAD140 has been conducted [R]. The Phase 1 trials are the first stage of testing in human subjects designed to assess safety, side effects, best dosage, and formulation method for the drug. Dose Escalation Study In Estrogen Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer The first Phase 1 trial involving RAD140 was a dose escalation study with a 3 + 3 design conducted in 2017 on 16 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The primary objective was to determine its safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose of RAD140. The secondary objectives were to evaluate pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity. The median age of the 16 patients enrolled in the trial was 58 years old. 88% of them had visceral disease and 94% had androgen receptor positive tumors determined via immunohistochemistry. 6 patients were given 50 mg RAD140 orally once per day. 7 patients were given 100 mg RAD140 orally once per day. The other 3 patients were given 150 mg RAD140 orally once per day. The median time on treatment was 8 weeks, with a range of 1-25 weeks for the entire group of patients. Over 30% of patients experienced an elevation of their ALT/AST levels, decreased weight/appetite, and constipation. Dose-limiting toxicities (all grade 3 and reversible) included hypophosphatemia and elevated ALT/AST. 2 patients experienced hypophosphatemia, and they were both in the 150 mg dosage group. 2 patients in the 50 mg and 100 mg dosage groups experienced elevated ALT/AST. No drug-related deaths occurred. There was 1 partial response in the 100 mg dosage group and 2 patients with stable disease for over 12 weeks. The time to partial response was 15.9 weeks and the duration was 8.6+ weeks. SHBG levels decreased in all 12 of the patients evaluated. PSA levels increased in 10 of the 14 patients evaluated, with the most notable increase occurring in the patient with a partial response to RAD140 treatment. That patient remained on the treatment at the 7 month mark. The provisional maximum tolerated dose of RAD140 was determined to be 100 mg dosed once per day orally. Overall, RAD140 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and exhibited preliminary evidence of target engagement and antitumor activity [R]. Is RAD140 As Strong As Steroids? Yes, kind of… RAD140 purportedly (not officially) has an anabolic:androgenic rating of 90:1 and partially antagonizes the negative effects of testosterone on the prostate. The anabolic:androgenic ratio is essentially a ratio which exhibits how much anabolic activity a specific compound will exert in the body, and how much androgenic activity it will exert in the body. Anabolic, meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (virilization), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. The androgenic:anabolic ratio of a compound is a very important factor when determining the potential clinical applications of it. Initial steroid research sought to synthesize a compound which retained a high degree of anabolic activity, coupled with a lack of androgenic activity, the goal being to produce a compound with a high anabolic yet low androgenic effect. Because steroids were intended for medical treatment, patients could include men and women, and even children. The last thing you want to do is give a girl a bunch of testosterone so she can prevent muscle wasting, only to have her end up with a myriad of masculinizing side effects like the deepening of her voice, acne, clitoral enlargement, body hair growth, and all the other negative side effects associated with anabolic androgenic steroids. The androgenic side effects of steroids in men aren't insignificant either. The risk of Gynecomastia (man boobs), endocrine shutdown (infertility), testicle shrinkage, negative effects on cholesterol, increased risk of heart disease, among many other side effects are all very real side effects of anabolic androgenic steroids. I'm not saying that these will absolutely happen at all, but there is a chance of them occurring with steroid use, with some of them still occurring with SARMs to a significant extent. Considering this, it is obviously very important to synthesize compounds that have as low of a risk of any of these side effects occurring, while still maximizing the anabolic efficacy of the treatment given to patients. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to anabolic effects are the drugs of choice in androgen-replacement therapy, but in the context of muscle and bone wasting prevention, compounds with a much higher anabolic/androgenic ratio are exponentially better candidates for treatment. Based on the preclinical data, RAD140 has shown that even with a complete absence of testosterone it can still induce just as much anabolic activity in muscle and bone as testosterone would, with several-fold less androgenic activity. This would consequently eliminate and replace the need for anabolic androgenic steroid use in degenerative musculoskeletal disease treatment. In addition, RAD140 synergistically works alongside testosterone to induce greater amounts of muscle growth in the body if they are used concurrently, while simultaneously decreasing testosterone’s negative side effects on the prostate [R].  Is RAD140 The Strongest SARM To Date? This is debatable as different SARMs act on the androgen receptor in different ways in different individuals. In general, it is undeniable that RAD140 is very strong, and pound for pound it is one of the strongest SARMs on paper with a purported 90:1 anabolic:androgenic ratio. It is formidable to LGD-4033 in terms of strength gains, although LGD-4033 seems to be a more potent overall muscle builder. RAD140 seems to have a muscle hardening effect that isn't commonly reported with LGD-4033. Increased muscular endurance from RAD140 is also reported to be one of its most redeeming traits. The only SARM that seems to outperform RAD140 in terms of muscle building, strength gains, and muscle hardening simultaneously is S23. However, S23 is more suppressive and has some odd side effects that aren't reported with RAD140. RAD140 Reviews (Anecdotal/Recreational Reports) RAD140 is one of the most popular SARMs in the fitness and bodybuilding community in the context of performance enhancement. It is most commonly used to gain muscle mass and increase strength. It is reported to also be very effective at increasing muscular endurance and overall stamina. While other SARMs help with muscular endurance to some degree, RAD140 in particular seems to excel in its ability to increase endurance, stamina and speed. This is not to be confused with Cardarine and SR9009, which are not SARMs. RAD140 is not as effective as Cardarine at increasing cardiovascular endurance. RAD140 is most commonly used for bulking, or in recomposition phases, and is often referred to as a dry gainer. It creates a harder, dryer look similar to SARMs like S4 and S23. Users often report a very noticeable aggression unique to RAD140 that is not notable in any other SARM except S23. This increased aggression has made RAD140 a fairly popular pre-workout alternative in the bodybuilding community. RAD140 Dosage Dosages of 10 – 30 mg per day are commonly used in a recreational context for muscle building purposes. There is no established therapeutic dosage of RAD140. RAD140 Half-Life Pharmacokinetic samples collected for 144 hours after the 100 mg RAD140 single dose showed variable absorption with a half-life of approximately 60 hours [R]. The observed human steady-state pharmacokinetic exposure at 100 mg exceeds the pharmacokinetic exposure of the efficacious dose in mice of 10 mg/kg. RAD140 Side Effects One thing you will often read is how there have been no reported side effects of RAD140. This is not the case, both anecdotally as well as in the limited clinical data. Potential Ventricular Inflammation Unpublished preclinical toxicology studies with RAD140 indicated that it induced focal inflammation of the right ventricle in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats [R]. With that being said, the same side effect was not noted in the male or female cynomolgous monkeys treated with RAD140, and preclinical rat models have some underlying issues in regards to cardiovascular risk. Androgens cause 11beta-hydroxylase inhibition in rat adrenal glands. Inhibiting this in rats causes an increase in the adrenal output of 11-deoxycorticosterone, which can cause cardiac lesions in rat hearts. Also, in another preclinical rodent model, high dosages of RAD140 had a protective effect on the heart. This was the first occurrence of rat cardiotoxicity reported for a SARM. The data supports that the focal inflammation in the rat studies cannot be extrapolated to primates and humans, so it is very unlikely that this same outcome would occur in humans. The fact that it didn't occur in monkeys with dosages as high as 1000 mg/kg/day is very reassuring that this outcome would be less likely to occur in humans, but it is notable nonetheless. Hair Loss While RAD140 exhibits one of the most impressive myotrophic/androgenic preclinical profiles, it cannot be ignored that there was still blatant increasing androgenic activity in a dose dependent manner in all animal models. Albeit limited due to the high level of tissue selectivity, RAD140 still exhibits androgenic activity in the body and will potentially lead to accelerated hair loss. However, it could also potentially reduce hair loss if used at a dosage that suppressed endogenous androgens and/or antagonized endogenous androgens at the androgen receptors enough that the androgen load on the body was lower than baseline, while still fulfilling the anabolic functions that would have otherwise been fulfilled via endogenous Testosterone. This does not exclude temporary shedding (acute telogen effluvium) which can be triggered by a hormonal fluctuation. This is not to be confused with androgenic alopecia, which is caused by follicular miniaturization induced by androgens. Based on the efficacy data comparing S1 to Finasteride, it is likely that RAD140 (if anything) would reduce the progression of hair loss at therapeutic dosages based on its tissue selectivity [R]. Anecdotally, recreational users report hair loss quite fairly frequently with RAD140 usage, however, this is with dosages that likely greatly exceed what the therapeutic dosage will be in a clinical setting. Whether this hair loss in the bodybuilding community is real androgenic alopecia or just temporary shedding is unclear and would require more data. Gynecomastia While the risk is relatively low based on anecdotal reports, it is safe to say that all SARMs can cause gynecomastia (gyno) as they impact the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Testes-Axis. By binding harder to the androgen receptors than endogenous androgens, there can be a diversion of more endogenous Testosterone to aromatize into Estrogen. Also, suppressing Testosterone production in itself can cause an imbalance in the ratio of endogenous androgens relative to endogenous Estrogen in the body, creating a hormone imbalance that encourages gynecomastia development. Estrogen management would be prudent during any usage of SARMs. Lowering Of Lipids Just like any other SARM or anabolic steroid, RAD140 exhibits a dose dependent lowering of lipids (LDL, HDL, triglycerides) [R]. One commonality among all anabolic androgenic compounds is that they will all suppress HDL cholesterol (“good” cholesterol) in a dose dependent manner, and this has been consistently demonstrated in clinical trials conducted on SARMs as well [R, R]. Every single SARM that has been evaluated has exhibited this same dose-dependent suppression of lipids. Testosterone Suppression Just like anabolic steroids, SARMs have all consistently exhibited suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Testes-Axis. The result of this is decreasing natural testosterone production in a dose-dependent manner [R]. Anecdotally, RAD140 is one of the most suppressive SARMs. In a preclinical primate model assessing its effect on endogenous Testosterone production, young monkeys with testosterone levels between 600-800 ng/dL (similar to the average Testosterone level of 25-54 year old human males) were treated with RAD140 for 28 days. In all treated monkeys, Testosterone levels dropped to about 50% of baseline, with the average Testosterone level decreasing to 200-300 ng/dL. This occurred even with dosages as low as 0.01 mg/kg [R]. Increased Estrogen Or Decreased Estrogen RAD140 does not aromatize into Estrogen, but it still has a large impact on the ratio of Testosterone:Estrogen in the body. RAD140 binds to androgen receptors harder than endogenous androgens, and can encourage increased amounts of endogenous aromatization of Testosterone to Estrogen by occupying vacant receptor sites. In addition, dose-dependent suppression of endogenous Testosterone levels can lead to a Testosterone:Estrogen imbalance. The systemic elevation of Estrogen levels in the body is often misinterpreted as the result of prohormone laced SARMs. High Estrogen Symptoms  Acne, oily skin Erectile dysfunction Low libido Lethargy Gynecomastia (man boobs) Irritability Depression Water retention High blood pressure Enlarged prostate Shrunken testicles Sugar cravings  High dosages and/or long-term use of RAD140 can cause a decrease in systemic Estrogen levels. This is facilitated through higher levels of endocrine suppression. Estrogen facilitated physiological functions in the body are mediated through the aromatization of Testosterone into a sufficient amount of Estrogen. If RAD140 usage suppresses endogenous Testosterone levels too low, it can result in Estrogen levels dropping as a consequence of the lack of aromatization occurring in the body in a suppressed state. When Estrogen levels get too low, a new set of side effects can occur. Low Estrogen Symptoms  Dull weak orgasms Dry skin and lips Dehydration Erectile dysfunction Low libido Irritability Mood swings Loss of appetite Fatigue Lethargy  Liver Toxicity Even at dosages 10 times higher than the efficacious dosage required to replicate the therapeutic anabolic benefits of Testosterone, RAD140 did not increase liver enzymes or exhibit any liver toxicity [R]. While this was just a preclinical animal model, it is promising for the development of RAD140 as other SARMs have shown potential liver toxicity concerns, albeit minimal at their therapeutic dosage amounts. Increased Aggression RAD140 users commonly report very blatant increases in aggression. While this is anecdotal, it has occurred consistently enough in the bodybuilding community that it should be considered. The interesting thing about this is that typically increased aggression only occurs when androgen index increases in the body. This is why more androgenic steroids are commonly used pre-workout for a quick boost in aggression before training. The fact that RAD140 is resulting in increased aggression in recreational users could potentially be indicative of some of the following outcomes:  RAD140 isn't as selective for anabolic activity relative to androgenic activity in humans as it was in the preclinical animal studies The dosage humans are using recreationally is far higher than needed Their RAD140 is fake and is another hormone entirely  I believe the second potential outcome is the most likely reason. Potential As A Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) Alternative For Men RAD140 is often labeled in the recreational fitness and bodybuilding community as a potentially safer HRT alternative for men. This has yet to be proven in clinical trials, and there is one massive inherent flaw that prevents RAD140 from being a standalone effective HRT alternative. That is its lack of aromatization into Estrogen. RAD140 does not aromatize into Estrogen, and also greatly suppresses endogenous Testosterone levels. The net result of this is suboptimal Estrogen levels to support basic physiological functions in the male body, and a myriad of low-estrogen side effects with long term use. Even if RAD140 was a viable alternative to Testosterone, it would either need to be used in conjunction with exogenous Testosterone, or Estrogen would need to be administered concurrently with RAD140. RAD140 is not a viable standalone treatment for hormone replacement therapy. While high levels of Estrogen can cause numerous negative side effects, low Estrogen levels can be just as deleterious in men. RAD140 PCT (Post Cycle Therapy) RAD140 is very suppressive and may require a PCT phase (post-cycle therapy) for efficient recovery. The goal of a PCT phase would be to restore natural Testosterone production as quickly as possible. Forgoing PCT may increase the risk of muscle loss, fat gain, among all of the other negative side effects associated with low Testosterone levels. How much time off should be taken after PCT should not be determined with the bro-science “time on = time off” equation, rather it should be dictated by individual specific factors and blood work.

The end result of this could be increased muscle growth potential that would otherwise be impossible to achieve. In this article, I break down exactly what to expect from YK11, how it differs from other “traditional” SARMs, and what potential applications it may have.

YK11 is a steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) and Myostatin inhibitor that was popularized because of its potential to induct supraphysiological levels of Follistatin expression. This SARM never passed the preclinical development stage and has never been tested on animals or humans. While there is a decent amount of anecdotal information to reference due to its popularity in the bodybuilding community, the data itself is fairly limited, as only a minority of individuals are logging their blood work consistently, and even fewer are getting extensive testing done to establish exactly what effects YK11 had on their body. One commonality among the majority of YK11 users are impressive increases in muscle growth, strength gains, improvements in body composition, with temporary natural Testosterone suppression being the most common obvious side effect. Cellular studies conducted on YK11 suggest that it has an anabolic effect on muscle tissue and bone which is mediated through androgen receptor activation, as well as via its induction of Follistatin expression [R, R]. It is unclear if YK11 was abandoned in preclinical development, and if it was, what the reason was. It is a very misunderstood compound which may have some very promising applications we have yet to learn about.  Is YK11 A SARM Or A Steroid? YK11 differs from traditional SARMs like LGD-4033 and Ostarine in that it is classified as both a SARM and a steroid due to its chemical structure. It is classified as a SARM only because of the limited data that suggests it has selective activation of the androgen receptor [R]. SARMs are traditionally non-steroidal, whereas YK11 clearly has a steroidal backbone [R].  Anecdotally, YK11 seems to behave similarly to DHT derived anabolic steroids. The term SARM can be applied relatively loosely in some contexts, and it should be noted that any compound that selectively activates the androgen receptor can technically be classified as a SARM, even if it blatantly belongs to another category of hormones entirely. A good example of this is Trenbolone, which is consistently referred to in animal models for its tissue selective SARM-like effects [R]. YK11 Mechanism Of Action YK11 binds to the androgen receptors in muscle and bone in a similar way to SARMs. After binding to the androgen receptors, it exerts tissue selective anabolic activity. It has a partial agonistic effect on the androgen receptor compared to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) [R]. As a partial agonist, YK11 only partially activates androgen receptors and will compete directly with endogenous Testosterone and DHT for receptor activation. The result of this could theoretically be a decrease in muscle size and strength should YK11 displace endogenous Testosterone. Of course, this would vary based on the dosage of YK11, the amount of endogenous androgens in the body, the amount of synthetic exogenous androgens in the body, and how YK11 actually works on the cellular level. One of the other mechanisms through which YK11 facilitates its effects after binding to the androgen receptor is by inducing greater expression of Follistatin. YK11 induces the muscle cells to produce more Follistatin, consequently inhibiting Myostatin in the body, which could then result in more overall muscle growth. The anabolic capabilities of YK11 could be largely mediated by its induction of increased Follistatin production, and the extent to which this occurs remains unknown. Despite YK11 having a traditional steroidal backbone, YK11 induced Follistatin expression while DHT did not [R]. The anabolic effects of YK11 were reversed with an anti-Follistatin antibody, thereby suggesting that the effect YK11 has on muscle growth is largely mediated via its induction of Follistatin. To date, no other known anabolic hormone is capable of inducing Follistatin production the same way YK11 can. Follistatin And How It Affects Muscle Building Follistatin is a protein that acts as an antagonist to Myostatin in the body, and is arguably one of the most critical factors that will determine how muscular someone can become [R]. While Follistatin is naturally occurring in the body, it is theorized that by increasing these levels you could inhibit more Myostatin, which would consequently remove the limitations your body sets on muscle growth. Myostatin inhibitors have been proposed by many to be the most promising new area of science in a bodybuilding context, as well as potentially better alternative treatment for muscle wasting diseases. Follistatin was first popularized when it was discovered that it quadrupled the muscle size of Myostatin deficient mice [R]. Mice that lack the gene that creates Myostatin have approximately twice as much muscle mass as normal mice. Mice that lack the gene that creates Myostatin and overproduce Follistatin simultaneously have approximately four times as much muscle mass as normal mice [R].  Follistatin increases muscle mass via another pathway as well that does not involve Myostatin inhibition, but what that pathway is remains unclear. 99.9% of Follistatin is fake, so I highly recommend that you DO NOT waste your money buying vials of Follistatin from research chemical websites. It is always bunk, and companies often take advantage of the hype around it by selling it at obscenely high prices. Myostatin And How It Affects Muscle Building Myostatin is a protein in the body that acts as a regulator of skeletal muscle mass, limiting how much muscle the body can grow. Interestingly enough, genetically gifted bodybuilders have been found to have very low levels of Myostatin in their bodies, which we can surmise is the reason why they have such a remarkable ability to pack on muscle. Supposedly, Flex Wheeler in particular (one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time) was a participant in a study conducted in collaboration with the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh involving 62 men.  All of these men made unusually large gains in muscle mass in response to strength training, and is why they were included in the study. When the results came in, Flex Wheeler was revealed to be one of only nine extreme responders that had a very rare Myostatin mutation at the exon 2 position on the gene. This is the rarest myostatin mutation found in humans, and the result of this mutation is a much larger number of muscle fibers than the average male. What Is A Myostatin Inhibitor? As Myostatin keeps your body from growing too much muscle, a Myostatin Inhibitor would be a compound that could inhibit Myostatin from acting on muscle cells, thereby allowing you to greatly surpass your previous muscle-building threshold. YK11 is a Myostatin inhibitor because it induces greater levels of Follistatin expression. In theory, by increasing Follistatin expression YK11 could indirectly inhibit Myostatin and facilitate anabolic effects in the body far greater than would be possible otherwise. YK11 Effects   Muscle Building   There are no animal or human trials to definitively state that YK11 has any effect whatsoever, however, in its cell-based studies and in hundreds of anecdotal logs it has exhibited a fairly substantial anabolic effect on muscle growth [R]. The mechanism by which YK11 facilitates its effects is different than the more mainstream SARMs, Steroids, or HGH. Because of this, it is theorized that YK11 could be added to any performance enhancing cycle for additional muscle growth and anabolic synergy.     Myostatin Inhibition     By facilitating an increase in Follistatin expression, YK11 will inhibit Myostatin, which may allow the user to surpass their genetic limit in regards to the accrual of muscle mass.   Bone Formation   YK11 upregulated osteoblastic proliferation in a cellular study [R]. Osteoblasts are cells that develop bone. By rapidly increasing the number of osteoblasts, YK11 may be able to help prevent and reverse bone wasting diseases. This function makes YK11 a promising SARM for osteoporosis and other androgen deficiency related diseases.   Muscle Hardening   Anecdotally, YK11 seems to produce a hardening effect similar to certain DHT derivatives. YK11 Reviews (Anecdotal/Recreational Reports) YK11 is reported to produce lean, dry gains. With the exception of hair loss, reports of other side effects from YK11 are typically less prevalent than with the more mainstream very suppressive SARMs. YK11’s chemical structure differs greatly from that of SARMs and resembles the chemical structure of an anabolic steroid. It may be more accurate to say that YK11 is a steroidal SARM, rather than to say it is a non-steroidal SARM. Unfortunately, it is pretty unclear exactly what it is as it is very new on the scene, and most of the conclusions being drawn about this compound are just based on personal opinion rather than true science. One thing we do know is that the unique effect YK11 has on Follistatin expression is completely unlike any SARM. Anecdotally, YK11 exhibits a blatant anabolic effect and has muscle building potential, however, it doesn't seem to produce any mind blowing muscle growth that would not be achievable with other far more thoroughly studied anabolic agents. Personally, I have yet to see one person take their physique to a new level solely from YK11, and it certainly has not produced any Flex Wheelers. With that being said, without human trials there is no way to actually assess how much YK11 can inhibit Myostatin in humans (if at all), and if there is a dosage that could equate to the same level of Myostatin inhibition that a genetic anomaly with a gene mutation has. YK11 isn’t necessarily better or worse than any other SARMs, but this is because it operates via a completely separate mechanism of inducing muscle growth. Because YK11 induces muscle growth via a completely separate pathway than other anabolic steroids or SARMs, it would be more productive to figure out what would work best alongside it, or if it is even worth exploring in the first place, rather than if it’s stronger or weaker than other anabolics that induce muscle growth in a totally different manner. YK11 Side Effects   Testosterone Suppression   YK11 suppresses natural testosterone levels in a dose-dependent manner the same way anabolic steroids and SARMs do [R]. This occurs via the suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Testes-Axis. While there have been no studies to test this specifically, anecdotal reports with blood work confirm that YK11 is suppressive.   Liver Toxicity   Anecdotally, YK11 has exhibited transient increases in liver enzymes.   Hair Loss   Anecdotally, reports of hair loss from YK11 are fairly common.   Joint And Tendon Weakness   Anecdotally, some users have reported joint pain while using YK11. Myostatin is expressed in tendons and appears to play an important role in tendon maintenance. Myostatin deficient mice have been found to have weak and brittle tendons [R]. This suggests that YK11 may have a negative effect on tendon strength as a consequence of Myostatin inhibition.   Aggression   Users report blatantly increased levels of aggression on YK11. YK11 Dosage 10 mg per day is the most common YK11 dosage used in a performance enhancing context. Some users report using daily dosages as high as 30 mg per day. The general consensus seems to be that 10 – 15 mg per day can produce desirable outcomes with a relative lack of side effects in men. There is no set in stone dosing protocol for YK11 and all current conclusions about effective dosages have derived entirely from anecdotal reports.  YK11 Half-Life The half-life of YK11 is unknown, so splitting the total daily dosage up into several micro-doses per day would likely yield better outcomes with more stable blood serum concentrations. YK11 PCT (Post Cycle Therapy) YK11 will suppress natural testosterone levels, so a PCT phase may be warranted.

It has an extremely high binding affinity, is very suppressive, and is a very potent muscle builder with a high level of tissue selectivity relative to anabolic androgenic steroids.

S23 is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) currently under development for potential use as a male hormonal contraceptive. It is still in the preclinical stage of development, meaning it has only been tested on animals, not humans. S23 exhibits a high affinity for the androgen receptor with tissue selective anabolic effects in muscle in bone, with relatively less stimulation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and other androgen affected tissues. S23 was created by modifying the structure of an older and less efficacious SARM called C-6 by changing the para-nitro group of C-6 to a cyano group [R]. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that C-6 is 76% orally bioavailable, and by swapping the para-nitro group for a cyano group S23 is able to achieve 96% oral bioavailability [R]. The closer a SARM is to 100% the closer it is to complete absorption after oral dosing. This means that S23 can be administered orally, as opposed to requiring injections to achieve maximal blood serum concentration levels, which is obviously advantageous when it comes to ease of use and adoption. The preclinical data revealed that S23 is the most suppressive SARM in development and resulted in infertility in all rats treated. Expectedly, this raised interest in its potential clinical applications as a form of male birth control. The most obvious drawback of the long-term utilization of SARMs in a hormone replacement context, or as a male hormonal contraceptive in the case of S23, is their lack of aromatization into Estrogen. S23 is no different as it does not aromatize into Estrogen in the body, and would require exogenous Estrogen administration in order to maintain normal sexual behavior, among a myriad of other physiological functions that are facilitated by healthy endogenous Estrogen levels. Contrary to popular belief, this also includes muscle building potential, as a lack of adequate Estrogen in men will not only hinder bone health, it will also severely inhibit the accrual of lean muscle mass. Its potential efficacy in a hormone replacement therapy context is outlined in the preclinical animal data, but the scientists also acknowledge the limitations of S23 monotherapy when considering it in this context. S23 has become increasingly popular in the recreational bodybuilding community for its potent muscle building and body recomposition effects. Recreational users are quick to label S23 as a more potent alternative to S4 (Andarine) without the night vision side effect. S23 has also shown to decrease prostate size in studies, which is the opposite of a very common negative side effect of anabolic steroids (enlargement of the prostate). This data is commonly misinterpreted though, as all SARMs will cause prostate hypertrophy in a dose dependent manner, and this is specifically referred to in the study. S23 in particular was shown to maintain the anabolic activity in muscle tissue equivalent to therapeutic levels of Testosterone at 0.1 mg per day in rats, while only stimulating prostate size up to 30% of an intact control rat (a healthy non-castrated rat with normal Testosterone/DHT levels) [R]. However, at dosages of 1 mg per day S23 maintained the prostate and seminal vesicles at weights equal to or greater than that observed in the intact rats.  Anecdotally, S23 is one of the most side effect ridden SARMs of all due to its high level of androgenic activity relative to other SARMs. Binding Affinity S23 has a very high binding affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) with a Ki of ∼1.7 nM [R]. The structural modification of C-6 didn't just increase S23's oral bioavailability, it also increased its AR binding affinity two times higher than that of C-6, which has a Ki of ∼4.9 nM. To put this in perspective, RAD140 demonstrated excellent affinity for the androgen receptor with a Ki of 7 nM [R]. S23 has a binding affinity over four times higher than RAD140, which was already considered impressive. The binding affinity of Testosterone and DHT remains unclear as each study seems to render significantly different values. In the RAD140 study the affinity for the androgen receptor for Testosterone was 29 nM, and 10 nM for DHT. In the study conducted on S23, DHT was stated to have a Ki of 0.45 nM. The only SARM that has been trialed on humans and isn't still in the preclinical stage that is reported to have a formidable binding affinity to S23 is LGD-4033, which has a Ki of ∼1 nM [R]. Mechanism Of Action S23 has a very high level of bioavailability which means it can be dosed orally without the need for injections or other inconvenient methods of administration. S23 does not require 17 alpha-alkylation to achieve 96% oral bioavailability, making it superior to traditional oral anabolic androgenic steroids in the context of liver toxicity. Oral steroids that feature a methyl or ethyl group at the C17α position are intentionally liver toxic so they are orally bioavailable and won't be destroyed by the liver. S23 and other SARMs appear to largely circumvent this issue, albeit not entirely, as liver enzyme elevations have been noted in the clinical trials conducted on humans using SARMs. After administration, S23 binds to the androgen receptor with a very high affinity, and actively competes with Testosterone and DHT for AR activation. Because of its high binding affinity, it is very effective at outcompeting Testosterone and DHT for receptor sites in muscle tissue and bone. After binding to the androgen receptor, S23 increases bone mineral density, lean mass, and reduces fat mass in a dose-dependent manner [R]. SARMs, like S23, stimulate androgen receptors in a selective way, whereby they induce a significantly greater amount of anabolic activity in the body relative to androgenic activity [R]. The high level of tissue selectivity and competitive binding affinity at the AR may potentially avert some of the risks and side effects that can occur when endogenous Testosterone is 5α-reduced into the more androgenic metabolite DHT. Some of these negative effects include but are not limited to benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate carcinoma, acne breakouts, and expedited male pattern baldness. The relative lack of androgenicity makes S23 a strong candidate for potential clinical applications for both men and women. However, while its tissue selectivity is superior to most FDA approved anabolic steroids, S23 has shown to be a full agonist in androgenic and anabolic tissues [R]. This makes it unique from other SARMs in development that are more prostate-sparing and selective for muscle tissue and bone, and most likely disqualifies its viability as a treatment for anything other than a male hormonal contraceptive. S23 Effects Increases Muscle Mass And Bone Mineral Density During the preclinical profiling of S23, it increased lean mass and bone mineral density [R]. This was not in a dose-dependent manner however, which implies that S23 has a point of diminishing returns in an anabolic context, and dosages higher than that point would just results in higher levels of androgenic activity and HPTA suppression. In another study comparing the efficacy of S23 to Testosterone, S23 attenuated muscle and bone tissue catabolism induced by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone and castration more effectively than Testosterone, with less androgenic activity [R]. The intention of the study was to establish how effective a SARM like S23 would be at preventing musculoskeletal degeneration in two scenarios that are common among men and women. One being musculoskeletal degeneration among hypogonadal men, and the other being musculoskeletal degeneration induced by prolonged use of glucocorticoids. Skeletal muscle wasting currently has no therapy, and the current treatments have all been riddled with severe limitations. Namely the androgenicity of anabolic steroids inducing virilization in women and androgen derived health ramifications in both men and women, as well as severe insulin resistance among those treated with growth hormone. Growth hormone still has yet to prove it has any anabolic effect on muscle tissue whatsoever, and it is illogically prescribed in absurd quantities to AIDS patients. Anecdotally, S23 is reported to be one of the most potent muscle builders among all of the SARMs currently in development. Fat Loss S23 decreases fat mass in a dose-dependent manner [R]. While the preclinical profiling revealed dose-dependent fat loss, I believe this is an indirect effect, rather than the direct mobilization of stored fat. In general, anabolic agents do not burn fat. As a human accrues more muscle mass, their basal metabolic rate will increase in parallel. This is guaranteed, therefore anything that can increase lean muscle mass will also indirectly impact total daily energy expenditure. Via increasing muscle mass S23 will also increase the body's metabolic rate (because it has more muscle tissue burning through more calories), which will indirectly result in increased fat loss in a dose-dependent manner in parallel to muscle mass accrual. It is very likely that S23 can indirectly increase fat loss, and that the amount of fat loss is entirely dependent on how much lean muscle gain is facilitated by the S23. Male Birth Control The preclinical assessment of S23's efficacy as a birth control pill is commonly misinterpreted. S23 showed to be one of the most suppressive SARMs in development, which is what sparked the interest to explore its potential as a form of male birth control. Despite S23 exhibiting a dose-dependent suppression of spermatogenesis, spontaneous recovery was achieved in all treated rats after cessation of treatment [R]. This makes it an ideal candidate as a potential male hormonal contraceptive. However, what is often not mentioned is the fact that infertility could only be achieved when S23 was administered in conjunction with Estradiol Benzoate [R]. To put this in perspective, one of the common ways male to female transgender hormone therapy is facilitated is with the administration of an antiandrogen in conjunction with Estradiol. The reason for this is that Estradiol can lower Testosterone production on its own by as much as 95%, and the antiandrogen is used to clean up the excess androgen receptor activation that would otherwise induce androgenic activity. The Estradiol also maintains physiological functions that are facilitated via healthy Estrogen levels, as having zero Estrogen in the body is not only horrible for women, but it is unhealthy for men as well. Estradiol has a dose dependent increase in Testosterone suppression, and because the serum levels in men have to remain below a certain threshold to prevent feminization, Estradiol monotherapy is not an efficacious treatment for male hormonal contraception. The main purpose exogenous Estradiol serves in a male contraceptive context is filling the void left when Testosterone is severely suppressed by the S23. This alternative method of therapy will require exogenous Estradiol administration to maintain healthy levels in the body, as there will no longer be any endogenous Testosterone aromatizing into sufficient amounts of Estrogen. While antiandrogens pick up the slack for transgender hormone therapy, the minimal dosage of Estradiol in conjunction with S23 picks up the slack in a male contraceptive context by further suppressing LH and FSH levels to 100% infertility levels. Estradiol = suppression of LH and FSH (not enough for complete infertility) S23 = suppression of LH and FSH (not enough for complete infertility) Estradiol + S23 = enough suppression of LH and FSH to achieve 100% infertility (at certain dosages) S23 monotherapy displayed only biphasic effects in the testis and eipdidymides, and Estradiol treatment in conjunction with S23 was necessary to mediate a 100% infertility rate [R]. This infertility rate was inconsistently achieved among the varying dosage groups, and further exemplifies how different bodies will be suppressed to varying degrees, and that complete infertility can likely only be consistently achieved when an exogenous progestin is added to further suppress LH. Personally, I believe that S23 induced suppression of the HPTA is not unique from other SARMs or Steroids, and the SARM is simply more suppressive than most. It is commonly believed that S23 inherently has some unique contraceptive effects, but this is not the case, it is just more suppressive milligram for milligram than other SARMs. Regardless of which androgens are used, eventually the endocrine system will become so taxed from hormone suppression that hormone replacement therapy will become an inevitable practice that will need to be adopted to maintain a high quality of life. Even if exogenous hormones weren't utilized, this would eventually occur for all men simply due to hormonal decline with aging. I also do not think that the ability to bounce back from S23 induced infertility is unique as is often implied. I'm confident that most healthy men will be able to regain fertility regardless of their level of HPTA suppression by utilizing a combination of HMG, HCG and Clomid, and I have yet to find one individual who this hasn't worked for, even among anabolic steroid abusers who have blasted for over a decade straight. I believe the same results found in the S23 study could be achieved with another very suppressive SARM like RAD140 or LGD-4033 in conjunction with oral Estradiol, but this is just speculation. S23 is the most promising option among the current SARMs in development as a potential male hormonal contraceptive simply due to its higher level of suppression, however, it is still not a turnkey solo treatment, and will require Estradiol and Progestin use in conjunction with it to truly be a consistently effective contraceptive. Increased Female Sexual Desire When a woman goes through menopause their ovaries may start producing fewer hormones. Menopause induced suboptimal Testosterone, Estrogen and Progesterone levels can result in a severe drop in sex drive. Estrogen is one of the primary hormones responsible for libido in men and women, and using synthetic Estradiol in menopause to bring levels up to where they should be has shown to alleviate menopausal symptoms in many women. However, for some women this isn't the root of the issue as they may still be androgen deficient. In addition, exogenous Estradiol administration will further suppress endogenous Testosterone production and exacerbate the issue if the root of the libido issue is a deficiency of androgens. This is where therapeutic androgen replacement may become necessary to fill the void left by suboptimal Testosterone production. However, competent doctors who understand this and are knowledgeable enough to treat it properly are few and far between, and often women are left scratching their heads because their doctor doesn't have an answer for them, or they won't prescribe Testosterone to Testosterone deficient women. S23 was evaluated in a preclinical model assessing its effects on sexual motivation. Expectedly, it increased female sexual desire [R]. Anything androgenic will increase libido, and considering the fact that S23 is a full agonist in androgen affected tissues, it is not surprising that it has a positive impact on female libido. The reason this may be advantageous is that the tissue selectivity of S23 is still much better than Testosterone, so it could be a potentially viable treatment for menopause induced androgen deficiency in women. S23 Reviews (Anecdotal/Recreational Reports) Despite S23 being developed as a male hormonal contraceptive, 99% of the anecdotal reports you will find online are in the context of it as a performance enhancer. When S23 first started being adopted into the bodybuilding world, one of my friends was the first to experiment with it and ran S23 for a duration of 8 weeks for the last 2/3 of his 12 week cut. The purpose of using it was to maintain lean muscle, maintain strength, and achieve the same drying out effects he would from DHT compounds he would normally use. He was basing this on the assumption that it would have a similar effect on body composition that Andarine has. He used a dose of 30 mg of S23 per day, spread out throughout the day into three 10 mg doses. The half-life of S23 in rats is 11.9 hours, which is why he split up his daily doses. Granted, this doesn't translate into a human equivalent half-life, but to be cautious, micro-dosing throughout the day will always lead to more stable blood serum concentrations than one single bolus dose per day. Over the course of those 8 weeks, he reported cosmetic enhancing effects formidable to that of the traditional DHT derived compounds he used to rely on (like Winstrol). By the time the cut was finished, he had maintained all of his muscle and strength, and had achieved a dryer look than he would have otherwise. This individual is on TRT, so the most expected side effect was mitigated entirely (suppression). His conclusion was that he would definitely use it again in the future, and that it is a worthwhile compound to research further. S23 is commonly reported to be “a jacked up version of S4”, exerting all of the same benefits to an even greater extent, without the vision side effects. Personally, I think this is blown out of proportion as Andarine is far more tissue selective than S23. One thing that is important to note is that all SARMs don’t work the same, despite exerting anabolic activity in the same manner. Based on what I’ve seen through anecdotal logs and personal friends experiences, S23 essentially falls into the “hardener” category. By this I mean that pre-contest, most bodybuilders utilize DHT derived drugs such as Masteron, Winstrol and Halotestin to harden up and add a level of grainy detail to their physique that would otherwise be unachievable. S23 seems to loosely fall into this category in a performance enhancing context, and it is reported to excel in cutting phases where the goal is to preserve lean muscle mass, strength, and reach a crazy level of muscular detail. I have heard it being compared to a high dose of Winstrol on numerous occasions, or just a souped up version of S4 essentially. 10% body fat on S23 tends to look more grainy and dry than 10% body fat off of S23. The same goes for hormones like Masteron and Winstrol, although S23 is more anabolic milligram to milligram than both of them. DHT derived compounds have a blatant cosmetic effect on the muscle that no other kind of compound can achieve. These kind of compounds are highly androgenic and are ideally reserved for the home stretch of pre-contest cutting phases, as exposure to these hormones can be very unhealthy. Having dry, grainy muscles when you are bulking up isn’t a good recipe for success either as your probability of getting injured will greatly increase. This doesn’t mean that S23 doesn’t have a place in a muscle growth/bulking context at all; I just personally wouldn't use it for that. Most other S23 reviews report similar findings, with the following characteristics being common among S23 cycles.  Impressive lean mass builder Notable increases in strength Improved body composition/fat loss (indirect fat loss via increased muscle mass accrual and thermogenesis) Mitigates catabolism in a calorie deficit Enhanced levels of muscle hardness, dryness, and vascularity similar to DHT derivatives Zero water retention  Despite all of the potential benefits that are typically the focus of S23 reports, the SARM has a handful of common unexpected side effects that have been consistently reported that are unique from most SARMs, and are odd to say the least. S23 Vs Steroids S23 is one of the few SARMs that has shown to replicate results equivalent to that of moderate doses of DHT derived anabolic steroids. Comparisons of S23 to a high dose of Winstrol are very common, and others have also reported it fairing very well in comparison to high doses of Masteron as well. It seems to be consistent across the board that this is a hardener/dry compound that produces a leaner, more conditioned look to the physique. S23 Vs Other SARMs S23 Vs RAD140 S23 has a higher binding affinity than RAD140, is more suppressive, but will also build more muscle and strength. With that being said, S23 is more androgenic than RAD140 and will result in more androgenic side effects. Anecdotally RAD140 is much more androgenic than it appeared to be in its preclinical profile, however, S23 still exceeds it in terms of overall androgenicity. S23 will also dry out the muscle more than RAD140. Whether this is via dehydration or a direct conditioning effect this remains unknown, but pound for pound it is safe to say that S23 is a more potent anabolic and androgenic agent in general than RAD140. S23 Vs S4 (Andarine) S23 is purported by many to be a jacked up version of S4 without the night vision side effect. It is true that S23 does not cause the same vision side effect as S4 and is a more potent muscle builder. However, it also has a less favorable level of tissue selectivity than S4 and will induce far more androgenic activity milligram for milligram. Even at what would be considered recreational high dosages, 30 mg of S23 has shown to be far more androgenic than 100 mg of S4. In a purely bodybuilding context, S23 is the more effective SARM at building muscle, however, when it comes to tissue selectivity and fitting the description of a novel SARM, S4 significantly outperforms S23 as it acts as a full androgen receptor agonist in muscle tissue and only a partial agonist in the prostate [R]. S23 Dosage Dosages of 10 – 30 mg per day are commonly used in a recreational context for muscle building purposes. There is no established therapeutic dosage of S23. Anecdotally, S23 is reported to show diminishing returns at dosages above 30 mg per day. These dosages were determined by recreational users based upon personal experimentation and anecdotal experiences, and are not indicative of correct or incorrect use. S23 Half-Life The mean terminal half-life of S23 in rats is 11.9 hours [R]. The half-life of S23 in humans is unknown, and would require mathematical estimation, or a clinical study (ideally) to determine it. S23 Side Effects Prostate Enlargement Despite S23 being hyped up for decreasing prostate size in rats in its initial preclinical rodent model, it has proven to be a less efficacious SARM due to its inferior tissue selectivity [R, R]. While S23 is still more tissue selective than non-selective androgens like Testosterone, it has shown to be a full agonist in androgenic and anabolic tissues [R]. This means that SARMs like LGD-4033 which are more tissue selective will induce much less androgenic activity at the same level of anabolic activity in muscle/bone. While S23 will greatly suppress endogenous Testosterone production, thereby reducing prostate size, this only proves that it is less androgenic than Testosterone and DHT. The prostate size maintained by S23 is still greater than what SARMs like Andarine and Ostarine would maintain at the dosage required to replicate therapeutic levels of anabolic activity in muscle and bone. S23 is one of the most misunderstood SARMs, and it will increase prostate size in a dose dependent manner, just to a lesser extent than Testosterone, DHT and other non-selective anabolic steroids. Increased Body Temperature A common side effect reported by S23 users is increased body temperature. As a result, S23 increases sweating and increased water intake seems to become necessary with moderate and high dosages of S23.   Night Sweats   Similar to Trenbolone, reports of night sweats from S23 are common. Why this occurs is unknown, however, it is entirely possible that S23 increases the body's metabolic rate, thereby increasing thermogenesis. The increase in body temperature would then cause sweating, and can be very noticeable at night when you're lying under the covers and wake up 8 hours later in a puddle of your own sweat.   Cramping   This is likely derived from the dehydrating effect S23 appears to cause through increased body temperature. The more you sweat, the more electrolytes you lose. The more dehydrated you are, your potential for cramping will increase in parallel. The mechanism behind S23 cramps are likely mediated by this, and may require an increase in water and electrolyte intake. Increased Aggression S23 users commonly report very blatant increases in aggression, similar to that of RAD140 and highly androgenic anabolic steroids. This further solidifies the androgenicity and relative lack of tissue selectivity of S23, as huge increases in aggression are flagship markers of highly androgenic compounds. At the dosages being used recreationally, it is very likely that significant amounts of androgenic activity are being induced in the body. Regardless of the fact that S23 is a SARM on paper, it is not as selective as SARMs like MK-2866. It is a full agonist in androgen affected tissues, and will display a higher incidence of androgenic side effects as a result of that. Typically, increased aggression only occurs when androgen index increases in the body. This is why more androgenic steroids are commonly used pre-workout for a quick boost in aggression before training. Acne Because S23 is a full agonist in androgen affected tissues, acne breakouts from S23 use are far more common than with other more tissue selective SARMs. Androgens stimulate the sebaceous glands and induce greater amounts of sebum production. Sebum is the stuff on your face that causes oily skin. Excessive amounts of sebum can clog the pores, and ultimately result in acne breakouts. In general, the more androgenic a compound is, the greater potential it has for causing acne. Hair Loss Hair loss derives from the androgenicity of S23 as well. Androgens will cause hair follicle miniaturization, which will ultimately cause hair loss. The more androgens you exert on your body, the more hair loss potential you will have. This is commonly misinterpreted by individuals who believe that DHT is the only hormone that can cause hair loss, but the fact is that any androgenic hormone will induce androgenic effects in the body in a dose dependent manner, and S23 is not exempt from that. The severity of how much hair loss an anabolic agent will cause is generally predicated upon its level of androgenicity, hence why DHT is much worse than Testosterone for hair loss. Despite the fact that it is so much worse, it does not make Testosterone hair loss safe at all. Testosterone simply has a lower androgen index than DHT and is more hair safe relative to harsher androgenic metabolites and several DHT derivatives. It definitely isn't “hair safe” though, and S23 certainly isn't either. Compared to other SARMs, S23 is one of the least hair safe SARMs in development. Lowering Of Lipids Expectedly, S23 induces a dose dependent lowering of HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Any anabolic androgenic compound will suppress HDL cholesterol in a dose dependent manner. This has been consistently shown in other clinical trials conducted on other SARMs as well [R, R]. Every single SARM that has been evaluated has shown this same dose-dependent suppression of lipids. Testosterone Suppression Just like anabolic steroids, SARMs have all consistently exhibited suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Testes-Axis. The result of this is decreased natural testosterone production in a dose-dependent manner [R]. S23 is one of the most suppressive SARMs, hence why it is being evaluated as a potential male hormonal contraceptive. In intact male rats treated for 14 days, S23 monotherapy suppressed LH levels by more than 50% at doses greater than 0.1 mg per day [R]. Gynecomastia While the incidence of gyno is low among users, it is certainly possible. One advantage S23 has over other SARMs in this context is that its androgenicity will likely have an antagonizing effect on Estrogen in the body. The more favorable the ratio of androgens to Estrogen is in the body, the less likely the incidence of gyno is, even when Estrogen levels are elevated out of range. While heightened androgenic activity defeats the purpose of SARMs tissue selectivity, it helps prevent gyno, which is a plus. All SARMs can cause gynecomastia as they suppress the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Testes-Axis and can throw off the ratio of androgens to Estrogen in the body. In addition, by binding harder to the androgen receptors than endogenous androgens, more endogenous Testosterone will divert to aromatize into Estrogen. Suppressing Testosterone production in itself can cause an imbalance in the ratio of endogenous androgens relative to endogenous Estrogen in the body, creating a hormone imbalance that encourages gynecomastia development. Estrogen management would be prudent during any usage of SARMs. Based on what we know, S23 has a more favorable preclinical profile than other SARMs when it comes to gynecomastia risk due to its full agonist activity in androgen affected tissues. Liver Toxicity Other SARMs have shown potential liver toxicity concerns, albeit minimal at their therapeutic dosage amounts. There is no preclinical data on the potential liver toxicity of S23, so it would be prudent to assume that at high enough dosages it could present the same limitations of other SARMs when it comes to taxation on the liver. S23 PCT (Post Cycle Therapy) S23 is very suppressive and almost certainly would warrant a PCT phase (post-cycle therapy) for efficient recovery. The goal of a PCT phase is to restore natural Testosterone production and hormonal balance as quickly as possible and prevent low androgen or high Estrogen side effects from occurring. Forgoing PCT will greatly increase the risk of muscle loss, fat gain, among all of the other negative side effects associated with low Testosterone levels. PCT after a cycle of S23 is especially important because of how suppressive it is on the HPTA. How much time off should be taken after PCT should not be determined with the bro-science “time on = time off” equation, rather it should be dictated by individual specific factors and blood work.

My goal of this experiment was to truly evaluate how anabolic injectable SARMs are without any interfering factors. To be more specific, I wanted to find out if injectable LGD-4033 could “replace” a TRT dose of Testosterone entirely in a muscle growth/retention context. If injectable SARMs could replicate the same muscle building potential as traditionally used anabolic steroids with a fraction of the androgenic activity, the potential applications would be endless. LGD-4033 is purported to have a 500:1 anabolic to androgenic ratio. The following graph illustrates the data derived from the preclinical studies which exhibits how much LGD-4033 stimulated muscle growth relative to prostate growth in comparison to Testosterone.    LGD-4033 Selectivity For Muscle To Prostate Compared To Testosterone LGD-4033 stacked up against Testosterone very well in the preclinical models with a greater than 500x tissue selectivity of muscle to prostate. As LGD-4033 is so tissue selective, individuals who are extremely prone to the androgenic side effects of Testosterone may be able to utilize LGD-4033 as a way to build supraphysiological amounts of muscle mass, or retain it, with a relative absence of those same side effects. How I Determined Exactly How Anabolic Injectable LGD-4033 Is By Utilizing Exogenous Estradiol    Most guys using injectable SARMs are using them alongside a Testosterone base at minimum. To truly evaluate the efficacy of injectable LGD-4033 in an anabolism context, all other androgens would need to be removed from the equation. As I just finished a Nandrolone monotherapy experiment prior to starting LGD-4033, my endogenous androgen production was completely shutdown. Estrogen is what has shown to be neuroprotective and not Testosterone (and potentially cardioprotective as well). Estrogen also supports several other functions in the body that would be inhibited if I were to forgo Estrogen replacement during this experiment. These include but are not limited to muscle growth and fat loss. I needed to isolate LGD-4033 and keep myself shut down to accurately assess how anabolic it is, so adding an exogenous aromatizing compound was not an option. The most common solution to insufficient Estrogen would be a Testosterone base, DHEA, HCG, or an aromatizing anabolic steroid like Dianabol or Trestolone to act as a makeshift “Test base”. None of these were viable options as they would add anabolic and androgenic activity to my body and skew my findings. The only option was to utilize exogenous Estradiol at a physiologic dose. This is because exogenous Estradiol would prevent my natural Testosterone production from turning back on (endogenous Testosterone production would also skew my findings), it would activate Estrogen receptors sufficiently to bandaid the issue of insufficient aromatization to fulfill physiologic functions, and it would not elevate androgenic activity in the body at all. In theory, by maintaining a physiologic level of Estrogen in the body I could largely avert the inhibition of anabolic pathways and assess exactly how anabolic LGD-4033 is with no factors interfering. The only potential drawback here is that aromatase is what normally regulates Estrogen production endogenously, and by bypassing this process entirely I could very well be missing out on some downstream anabolic pathways that would otherwise be fulfilled by Testosterone aromatizing into Estrogen. Just one of these being the IGF-1 pathway. The experiment is not perfect, but it is the closest I am going to get to it. Prior to my Nandrolone experiment I was maintaining my physique on 100 mg of Testosterone per week, and I was able to retain the same level of muscle mass and strength during my Nandrolone experiment with no other factors changed. If injectable LGD-4033 proved capable of maintaining my physique with no factors changed in my diet or training, then I would know that it is at least as anabolic as Testosterone and Nandrolone, but with a fraction of the androgenic activity. Oral SARMs Vs. Injectable SARMs Oral SARMs have shown to have a handful of common side effects in a clinical setting, with numerous other side effects cropping up when utilized in a performance enhancing context at higher dosages. The main side effects that are consistently seen both clinically as well as anecdotally with oral SARMs are:  Negative Effect On Lipid Profile Natural Testosterone Suppression Liver Toxicity (less common)   Other less common side effects start to crop up once the dosage used greatly exceeds what has been evaluated on humans clinically. The potential benefits that injectable SARMs have over oral SARMs mainly come down to increased bioavailability and skipping the first pass effect in the body after administration. Bioavailability Many SARMs have undisclosed oral bioavailability and are presumed to be low based on the lack of published data. Obviously this isn't a scientific way to go about determining a SARM's oral bioavailability, but until these pharmaceutical companies start to release more transparent data, researchers will speculate and make assumptions that could be true, or could be way off. Some SARMs have shown to have reasonable levels of oral bioavailability, but we don't have exact figures for the majority of them. The closer a SARM is to 100% the closer it is to complete absorption after oral dosing. With injection, complete bioavailability is guaranteed as we are basically forcing the body to assimilate it into the blood and carry it to target tissues, whereas with oral administration we are giving the body's oral drug metabolism an opportunity to break down the compound however it sees fit. By ensuring complete bioavailability with injection, we may be able to minimize the dosage required to yield a desired effect. In theory, this should result in less side effects and more anabolic activity milligram for milligram. This is the first potential benefit of injectable SARMs over oral SARMs. In some cases, like with SR9009 (not a SARM but is commonly lumped into the “SARMs” category), the body nearly completely breaks it down when it is administered orally, rendering it ineffective. Some oral SARMs are very bioavailable as is and we do have the data to reinforce that. For example, the SARM S23 is 96% orally bioavailable [R]. This means that S23 can be administered orally, as opposed to requiring injections to achieve maximal blood serum concentration levels, which is obviously advantageous when it comes to ease of use and adoption. The First Pass Effect – Drug Metabolism Despite having nearly 100% bioavailability, oral S23 administration may have a completely different effect in the body simply by injecting it. The same could apply for any other SARM too, not just S23. After a drug is swallowed, the digestive system absorbs it and it enters the hepatic portal system. Afterwards, the portal vein carries it into the liver for metabolization, which then essentially regulates how much is filtered out prior to delivery to the circulatory system for delivery to target tissues. Not only can this process greatly reduce how much of a drug actually gets through for utilization, but it can produce a variety of side effects that wouldn't occur with methods of administration that skip the first pass. Methods of administration like transdermal delivery or injection skip the first pass and can avoid the hepatotoxicity often associated with oral drug metabolism, as well as other side effects that can stem from the drug metabolism process itself. More often than not, this is a good thing. However, in the case of anabolic agents, it seems that the first pass can actually be responsbile for the potentiation of certain compounds, rather than the other way around. You can see how this can start to make injectable SARMs vs. oral SARMs murky territory, as we basically need to experiment with it ourselves to see if the increased bioavailability and skipping the first pass improves the anabolic activity relative to the side effect profile of SARMs, or makes it worse. For what it is worth, as of now the results seem promising, with the majority of individuals noting only drastically increased levels of anabolic activity at lower dosages, and less side effects. However, regardless of how promising and exciting this may seem, we need to consider the possibility of negative outcomes and not let the hype around injectable SARMs shroud our judgment. Examples Of How The First Pass Effect Can Greatly Impact Drug Effects The following are two examples of how drastic of a difference just changing the method of administration can have when it comes to a drug's effects on the body. The first shows how injectable and transdermal estradiol was superior to oral estradiol, and the second shows how oral Superdrol was superior to injectable Superdrol (in a tissue selectivity context, not a hepatotoxicity or lipid dysfunction context). Oral Estrogen Vs. Transdermal Or Injectable Estrogen A few of the most notable drawbacks of oral estrogen pills are that they can be somewhat liver toxic, they significantly spike SHBG levels, and they result in the production of clotting factors in the blood that do not develop with forms of administration that skip the first pass. Also, the ratio of Estrone-to-Estradiol is skewed with massive elevations in Estrone with oral Estrogen administration. None of these issues occur with transdermal topical application, or injection. High levels of serum Estrone sulfate (E1S) were found after long-term oral estrogen treatment of commonly prescribed dosages, whereas there was a small increase in E1S levels after transdermal Estradiol (E2) therapy. The mean maximum E1S levels were more than 20-fold higher with oral estradiol (E2) when compared with the 0.05 mg/day transdermal estradiol patch. This is consistent with the 20-fold higher dose of E2 when compared with the transdermal dose [R]. Oral estrogen also has very low bioavailability, thus requiring a much higher dosage to achieve the same effect that could be achieved with a much lower dosage of injectable estrogen. Oral Superdrol Vs. Injectable Superdrol Not only is the side effect profile of oral Superdrol compared to injectable Superdrol substantially different, but even its anabolic to androgenic ratio changes based on the method of administration.   When administered orally, Superdrol was more anabolic than methyltestosterone and several times less androgenic than methyltestosterone. Methyltestosterone has an anabolic to androgenic ratio similar to that of testosterone (close to 1:1). When administered via injection, Superdrol was nearly twice as anabolic as testosterone and twice as androgenic as testosterone. The results of subsequent assays to determine Superdrol's anabolic and androgenic activity found that that Superdrol possessed the oral bioavailability of methyltestosterone while being 400% as anabolic and 20% as androgenic, yielding an anabolic to androgenic ratio of 20:1 [R]. In the case of Superdrol, injecting it actually made it less tissue selective, despite oral administration having the obvious drawback of lower bioavailability and hepatotoxicity.   My Daily Injectable LGD-4033 And Estradiol Dosage As the goal of this experiment was to determine the lowest effective dose of LGD-4033 that could replicate the same anabolic activity as 100 mg of Testosterone per week and 100 mg of Nandrolone per week, my dose was much lower than what most are utilizing in their own experiments. Once I could determine the lowest effective dosage, I could evaluate the side effect profile of that dosage, how my blood work looks on that dose, how I feel, and then make an informed decision about the overall efficacy profile of injectable LGD-4033 based on all of those factors. As injectable LGD-4033 is more bioavailable, the dosage required to replicate the anabolic activity I was shooting for would likely be much lower than you would expect via oral dosing. I spoke to Tony and Trevor about this experiment and asked for their feedback on what dose they think I should start at. They were the two who brought injectable SARMs to my attention in the first place, and nobody else I know had any experience with them at the time. At 7:02 in the following video Tony and Trevor are referring to me, and that is partially what influenced my decision to go with 3 mg per day as my daily dose. https://youtu.be/F2OcSnQZ99Q?t=422 I also applied 2.5 grams of transdermal Estrogel (delivering 1.5 mg Estradiol) per day for the first couple weeks. I got my blood test results back from my Nandrolone experiment a couple weeks into my LGD-4033 experiment which showed that I was absorbing Estrogel very poorly, which prompted me to switch to oral Estradiol pills. My dose was 1 mg per day of Estrofem (oral 17ß-oestradiol). Ideally I would have switched to Estradiol injections, but I did not have any injectable Estradiol on hand, so I was forced to use oral pills if I wanted to maintain an optimal Estradiol level throughout the experiment. Injectable LGD-4033 Half-Life And Dosing Schedule Orally, LGD-4033 displayed a prolonged elimination half-life (24–36 hours), linear pharmacokinetics, and predictable accumulation with multiple dosing [R]. LGD-4033 dose proportional increase in systemic exposure on days 1 and 21. There was a dose-proportional increase in LGD-4033 concentrations on days 1 and 21 because of its long half-life. Serum LGD-4033 concentrations were nearly threefold higher on day 21 than on day 1, reflecting accumulation upon multiple dosing. There is not any human data we can refer to that evaluates the pharmacokinetics of injectable LGD-4033, so any statements made about how often it should be dosed are largely based on speculation and educated guesses. Tony and Trevor believe that injectable LGD-4033 can be dosed every other day and still maintain stable blood serum concentrations. https://youtu.be/1aTQWN3ML3U For the sake of ensuring stability once dose saturation was reached, I maintained a daily dosing schedule from day 1 where I administered 3 mg every 24 hours. Muscle Growth And Strength Levels  How I assess if something is working or not is by comparing it to my previous baseline metrics I have established on a therapeutic dose of TRT. If I suddenly start getting stronger while using the exact same diet and training regimen with the only factor changed being a drug, I can logically conclude that the drug is stronger milligram for milligram than my baseline on TRT. By now, I know exactly how my body responds to 100 mg of Testosterone per week, as well as 100 mg of Nandrolone per week. After swapping to injectable LGD-4033 with no other factors changed, it was very easy to assess if there were any positive or negative changes in my body composition or strength. Other than feeling a bit deflated, I didn't experience any changes in my strength or size. My weight stayed exactly the same, my strength stayed exactly the same, and my body composition stayed the same, with the exception of being a bit flatter. Perhaps the reason I'm flatter is that LGD-4033 has less “off target” activation than something like Testosterone and Nandrolone, whereby they can increase intramuscular fullness via indirect mechanisms. That is just speculation though. At the end of the day, I haven't lost any contractile tissue, which is the most important thing to note. I believe that a relatively low dose of injectable LGD-4033 is at least as anabolic as 100 mg of Testosterone per week or 100 mg of Nandrolone per week. While this is promising for those on TRT or who use “low” dosages of anabolic steroids, the main drawback we have seen in the past with oral SARMs is that the ceiling where diminishing returns starts to set in is far lower than with anabolic steroids. Whether or not injectable LGD-4033 has that same drawback remains to be seen. Anecdotally, other users have reported that the ceiling of diminishing returns is much higher with injectable LGD-4033, but I cannot confirm or deny this myself as that is beyond the scope of my experiment (at least for now). My only hope for this experiment was that I could retain all my muscle with just a SARM, which I did. I may consider a “blast” phase in the future where I titrate the dose up and evaluate how well it can support supraphysiological muscle growth, but that will be dictated by its androgenicity in practical application. Injectable LGD-4033's androgenicity still needs to be explored more via further experimentation, as I did have a few red flags of androgenic activity that have me a bit hesitant to utilize a higher dose. If injectable LGD-4033 is as tissue selective as the clinical data has shown, there are several doors that open up in a bodybuilding and hair loss prevention context. Side Effects Changes In Libido My sex drive went up substantially after swapping Nandrolone out for LGD-4033. Many were quick to comment on my YouTube video about how exogenous Estradiol (E2) is the reason why my libido spiked. I was already on exogenous Estradiol prior to the injectable LGD-4033 for my Nandrolone-only experiment. I have been on the same dose of transdermal E2 for almost 3 months, the only thing that changed was swapping NPP out for LGD. The libido change was from the swap. No other factors were changed. After I switched from transdermal Estradiol to oral Estradiol, my libido was no different either. The change in libido occurred almost overnight after adding LGD-4033 in. Several other individuals have come forward since that video was published reporting that injectable LGD-4033 increased their libido as well. They were all using a dose at least 5-10x higher than I was, but it is still notable nonetheless. As LGD-4033 is supposed to be so tissue selective and have such a lack of androgenicity I was very surprised that my libido spiked. If anything, I was expecting my libido to drop. With a 500:1 anabolic to androgenic ratio, obviously you wouldn't expect one of the biggest red flags of androgenic activity to spike. Keep in mind, 100 mg of Nandrolone per week is not nothing. Despite Nandrolone being one of the least androgenic steroids ever developed (if not the least of the mainstream anabolic steroids), 100 mg per week has shown to be a high enough dose to cause virilization in women. Within 12 weeks, some women will experience virilization on Nandrolone even using only 100 mg every 2 weeks. When duration of use exceeds a year, significant virilization in women is found even at a dosage of only 50 mg every 2 weeks. My libido doubled after switching from NPP to injectable LGD-4033, which is a red flag and should be noted. My libido isn't as high as it is on 100 mg per week of Testosterone, but it is significantly higher than on Nandrolone. Hair Loss I noticed an increase in shedding using injectable LGD-4033. Further experimentation will be needed before I have a concrete conclusion on the androgenicity of injectable LGD-4033. If it ends up being hair safe, there are several applications I have in mind for this compound. Not only would it be a potent androgen receptor agonist for use in a bodybuilding context, but it could also be utilized during a hair recovery phase. For example, if you have any androgenic alopecia, periodically switching to SARMs with exogenous Estradiol (or an Estrogen precursor) in cycles could be a way to maintain muscle built via supraphysiological steroid use in the past, while reducing the androgen load on the scalp significantly enough to allow for regrowth. Or, if you don't use steroids, it could serve as a means of recovering hair lost via endogenous androgen induced miniaturization by reducing androgenicity below baseline periodically throughout the year. Basically like a makeshift anti-androgen that won't strip the muscle off your body. These are hypothetical examples, but these are just a few of the potential applications I see for SARMs in the future. *Update February 26th, 2020* I do not believe injectable LGD-4033 at the dosage I used is hair safe, and it may be even worse than some traditional AAS (see my blood work results video below for more elaborate details). Changes In Body Hair Growth This one was a metric I should have kept a closer eye on, but I usually manscape every single week so it wasn't something I originally planned on evaluating. A few weeks into my LGD-4033 experiment I noticed that my body hair seemed to be growing a bit faster than usual. Whether this was in my head or not, I'm not positive as I was not even planning on using this as a metric, but I got backlogged on work throughout the holidays and ended up skipping my weekly manscaping sessions. While it may not be fair to say for certain that LGD-4033 increased my rate of body hair growth, I can confidently say that at the absolute least, it did not reduce my body hair growth. This is notable as well because I had no androgens in my body. If I only had Estrogen in my system and no androgens I would notice a drastic reduction in body hair growth and libido, just like transgenders who transition from male to female. The only anabolic compound in my body throughout this entire experiment was injectable LGD-4033, and I didn't notice a reduction in androgenic activity via body hair growth either. When I crushed my DHT levels to 0 with Dutasteride, I noticed a significant reduction in back hair growth. On injectable LGD-4033, I did not notice a reduction in body hair growth at all. However, on Nandrolone I did not experience a significant reduction in body hair growth either, despite it dramatically reducing my libido. While this metric isn't a scientific way to assess androgenic activity, in general, the body can tell you pretty accurately when androgenic activity is high or low when sufficient Estrogen is present to support erections. Increase the androgenic activity in your body and you will likely experience an increase in libido, an increase in scalp hair loss, and an increase in body hair growth (in general). Decrease the androgenic activity in your body and you will likely experience a decrease in libido, a decrease in scalp hair loss, and a decrease in body hair growth (in general). Changes In Blood Pressure  My blood pressure on injectable LGD-4033 is identical to what it is normally on TRT. My blood pressure on injectable LGD-4033 and TRT is far better than it is on Nandrolone. For whatever reason, Nandrolone has a unique negative impact on systolic blood pressure, making it difficult to maintain healthy levels. On only 100 mg of NPP per week my systolic blood pressure was consistently 125-128 eating the exact same diet I was on TRT and LGD-4033. So far so good in regards to blood pressure on injectable LGD-4033 though. Changes In Resting Heart Rate  My resting heart rate did not increase on injectable LGD-4033 and is no different than what it is on TRT. Potential In Preventing Or Reversing Cardiovascular Issues Caused By Steroid Use Even if injectable LGD-4033 does not end up being as purely anabolic as we hoped, there is another very promising application I see for injectable SARMs that is largely overlooked. That is the potential lack of heart stimulation. Anecdotally, many users have reported far better outcomes using SARMs than anabolic steroids in a cardiovascular health context. One example is a friend of mine, Alek Mitrevski. He used 100 mg of oral S4 (Andarine) with 0.5 mg oral Estradiol per day for over a year straight. During that time he did not experience any cardiac hypertrophy, LVH, or any kind of deleterious effect on his cardiovascular system. At the start of 2019 Alek ran a high dose Deca only cycle with Anadrol intermittently added in.  Within 9 months, he experienced significant thickening and enlargement of his heart. He switched back to SARMs only to try and reverse this damage while maintaining the muscle he built with the Deca + Anadrol blast. Although the reports are obscure and not well documented, I have seen a handful of individuals report the reversal of cardiomyopathy and LVH after switching to SARMs only. SARMs are supposed to be tissue selective, whereas anabolic steroids have shown to significantly impair cardiac health. The potential applications this may have for athletes seeking supraphysiological muscle growth with a minimization of cardiac hypertrophy, LVH, etc. makes injectable SARMs worth further exploration in itself. Athletes seeking to reverse cardiovascular issues as a result of past AAS abuse while maintaining most (or all) of their hard earned muscle mass would also be strong candidates for benefiting from injectable SARMs if the hype around them turns out to be justified. My Blood Test Results *Update February 26th, 2020*  I got my blood test results and I am adding them to the article now here:  My commentary is also available in the video, but to put it simply, the blood test results were disappointing and I will be ending the experiment now. Reviews From Other Users I have curated all of the injectable LGD-4033 reviews I could find and included them here for your reference as well.           https://youtu.be/rJFmwpPvBfQ  The following comments weren't reviews about injectable LGD-4033 specifically, but they were relevant to include nonetheless:    Conclusion Some of the classic signs of androgenic activity are red flags worth keeping an eye on. But other than that, so far so good. I feel good, I am not depressed and have not experienced any negative mental or physical side effects so far despite the near complete absence of Testosterone and DHT in my body. The fact that injectable LGD-4033 has proved capable of maintaining the same amount of muscle and strength that I could maintain on 100 mg of Testosterone per week and 100 mg of Nandrolone per week is a good sign. I was hoping for that outcome, and expecting more than that is wishful thinking. If a relatively low dose of injectable SARMs can replicate the same anabolic activity of traditionally used steroids, then it is absolutely worth further experimentation. I'm going to continue digging into injectable SARMs, and I look forward to seeing more data come from other researchers in the community as well. This is a very promising area of research, and I hope that more individuals start to come forward with their personal findings too. I'll keep you guys updated, but that is where we're at with my injectable SARMs experiment so far. *Update February 26th 2020* My blood test results came back, and I have some concluding thoughts on this experiment I highly recommend you listen to thoroughly prior to any experimentation of your own.

    "content": "Deca Only For HRT – A Comprehensive Overview And My Personal Blood Work     There's been a growing amount of hype around the “Deca only cycle”. While it is most commonly referred to as the Deca only cycle, it is actually based on the compound Nandrolone being used on its own. The decanoate ester being abbreviated as “Deca” has just become synonymous nowadays in the bodybuilding community with Nandrolone itself. Seeing the potential merits of Nandrolone as a makeshift hormone replacement therapy alternative to Testosterone, I stopped using Testosterone and instead started using Nandrolone on its own with exogenous Estradiol for 3 months and paid over $1000 for an elaborate blood panel to assess how it affected my health markers.

In reality, it's a lot more nuanced than that. The reason why I found this experiment worth pursuing is the lack of androgenicity of Nandrolone in the body. Nandrolone 5α-reduces in tissues that express 5α-reductase to the much less androgenic metabolite Dihydronandrolone (DHN). Nandrolone is basically the only anabolic steroid that is going to maintain 100% anabolic activity of the Nandrolone in muscle tissue where you want it, but also be converted into a much less androgenic metabolite with a lower binding affinity in certain areas of the body where you wouldn't want Nandrolone to bind. The two areas of concern for most individuals being hair follicles and skin. By converting to DHN in these areas, Nandrolone (and by extension DHN) causes less hair loss and acne than Testosterone (and by extension DHT). In addition, some men are genetically predisposed to high levels of aromatization and estrogen receptor expression and can't even use TRT doses of Testosterone without experiencing estrogenic side effects. Nandrolone is not a potent substrate for aromatase, and mainly converts to a weaker estrogen called Estrone (Estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than Estrone). Nandrolone is also mildly estrogenic on its own via its ability to act as an estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) agonist [R]. Overall, Nandrolone is much less androgenic and estrogenic than Testosterone, and may provide symptom relief in those seeking a viable hormone replacement therapy alternative. In this context, Nandrolone may also have great potential as an efficacious alternative to Testosterone as an anabolic agent for some individuals who are prone to androgenic and/or estrogenic side effects. The Neurotoxicity And Cardiotoxicity Of Nandrolone Based on the limited data available, Nandrolone has shown to be more deleterious to cardiovascular and neurological health than testosterone.  By extrapolating the data, we start to get a clearer picture as to why this likely is. Nandrolone is mildly estrogenic on its own, and it does not aromatize nearly enough to create as much Estradiol as Testosterone does. Comparing the effect of testosterone with that of 19-nortestosterone (Nandrolone) and Stanozolol (Winstrol) on neurotoxicity we can clearly see that Estrogen is what protects neurons in the brain, not Testosterone itself. In this study, a physiologic dosage of Testosterone was neuroprotective [R]. Testosterone only amplified neurotoxicity at supraphysiological dosages. The neuroprotective effect of a physiologic dosage of Testosterone was completely eliminated when the aromatase inhibitor Anastrozole (Arimidex) was co-administered, suggesting that the intrinsic toxicity of Testosterone as an androgen is only counterbalanced by its aromatization into 17β-estradiol.  As opposed to testosterone, Nandrolone does not appear to aromatize sufficiently into estrogen. As you would expect, Nandrolone was neurotoxic at every single dose evaluated regardless of Arimidex being co-administered or not. If Nandrolone was inherently able to provide enough estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activation to balance out its androgenicity without even requiring aromatization (it acts as an estrogen on its own to some extent), we would see a neuroprotective effect at equivalent dosages to a physiologic concentration of Testosterone when no AI is used, but that does not appear to be the case either.  The anti-androgen flutamide attenuated the neurotoxicity of all three androgens, thus further reinforcing that physiologic dosages of androgens without a sufficient amount of opposing estrogens, or supraphysiological dosages of androgens may facilitate neuronal death. I suspect that the same applies for the inherent cardiotoxicity of Nandrolone as well.  Just because you can get your Estradiol levels up to 15 pg/mL with a gram of Deca only, that ratio of androgens to estrogen in the body is way off of what would otherwise be optimal for health based on what I've seen. This is reinforced by the fact that Flutamide (an anti-androgen) was able to attenuate the neurotoxicity of Nandrolone. By preventing Nandrolone from binding to androgen receptors, it is no longer able to transcribe its effects in tissues. Hair loss and acne are one thing, cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity are another thing and should ultimately take precedence obviously. However, just because Nandrolone monotherapy cannot produce a sufficient ratio of androgens to estrogens, that doesn't mean that there isn't a potential loophole. That loophole is exogenous Estradiol administration. Exogenous Estradiol Use With Nandrolone Only Cycles As we've seen, Estrogen produced via aromatase is what provides neuroprotection from the androgenicity of Testosterone, not the Testosterone itself. We also know that Nandrolone is not able to produce enough estrogenic activity in the body to facilitate this same level of neuroprotection. I theorize that Nandrolone in conjunction with exogenous Estradiol to replace this otherwise missing component could attenuate a significant amount of the deleterious impact Nandrolone has on the heart and brain. In addition, by providing a sufficient amount of exogenous estrogen, libido, muscle growth, fat loss, and several other aspects of health and performance should be more optimized. It isn't a coincidence that cardiovascular disease rates skyrocket once women hit menopause and stop producing Estrogen properly. The same negative effects will apply in men with low Estrogen levels. The lack of sufficient Estrogen is often addressed in Deca only cycles by adding an adjunct anabolic steroid that aromatizes into Estrogen or Estrogen analogs. Obviously for those seeking to minimize androgenic side effects, the ideal way to go about achieving sufficient Estrogen receptor activation is probably not going to be by adding more steroids to their protocol. This is where exogenous Estradiol comes into play, and I believe the majority of Deca only cycles would be more sustainable from a health perspective, and successful in a bodybuilding context as well with its inclusion. I have yet to see one person on a Deca only cycle achieve a sufficient Estradiol level relative to their Nandrolone dosage via a sensitive assay Estradiol blood test. The following blood test result was submitted by an individual on over 1000 mg per week of Deca only.  Over a gram of androgens relative to a 19.2 pg/mL Estradiol level is far from ideal in my opinion. I had a good conversation with Vigorous Steve as well about his Deca only cycle experience. He told me that his Estradiol was 12 pg/mL on 1000 mg of Deca per week after 4 weeks, and he ended up adding 25 mg DHEA per day just to bring it up to 25 pg/mL. When it comes to Nandrolone use on its own, most would benefit from more Estrogen in my opinion. My Weekly Nandrolone And Estradiol Dosage For “HRT” Most guys doing Deca only cycles are evaluating Nandrolone at dosages of 600 mg or higher per week for short blasts. My experiment was based on its potential as an alternative long term HRT option for those prone to androgenic side effects. Or alternatively, its potential as a compound to swap to periodically throughout the year from TRT to reverse some of the androgenic side effects of Testosterone and DHT while still maintaining the same amount of muscle mass. Every blood test I've seen of Deca only cycle users was on high doses of Nandrolone without a sufficient amount of Estrogen. I wanted to see how Nandrolone on its own at a “therapeutic dose” would affect my blood work if I had a sufficient amount of Estrogen provided through exogenous Estradiol. Long-term, the only way Nandrolone monotherapy could be even relatively safe in a cardiovascular context would be with exogenous Estradiol supplementation from what I've seen. And even then, I'm sure it has major drawbacks that will likely accumulate over the years. With that being said, it is still something I wanted to explore nonetheless, as it is one of the few compounds that can actually support supraphysiological muscle growth with a relatively minimal impact on androgenic alopecia. Oral micronized Estradiol tablets have quite a few drawbacks. A few of the most notable drawbacks are that oral Estrogen pills can be somewhat liver toxic, they spike SHBG through the roof, and they result in the production of clotting factors in the blood that do not develop with forms of administration that skip the first pass. The two most viable methods of administration that skip the first pass are transdermal topical application, or injection. I chose to topically apply transdermal Estradiol gel (Estrogel) for this experiment.  I used 100 mg of Nandrolone phenylpropionate (NPP) per week split into daily injections using an insulin pin rotating between my glutes and ventroglutes. I also applied 2.5 grams of transdermal Estrogel (delivering 1.5 mg Estradiol) to my inner thighs every day for over 3 months straight. Blood Pressure Changes On Nandrolone One of the first things I noticed was that it was a struggle to keep my blood pressure in check on NPP, even at the mild dose I was using. What that was caused by exactly, I'm not sure. I assumed it was Aldosterone prior to this blood work. When I'm on Testosterone, even when I was using TRT as high as 200 mg per week, I could keep my blood pressure at 110/70 with ease. Even if I ate terribly, I could still hold 115/75 without even trying on Testosterone. Within the first week of switching to NPP it became way harder to control my systolic blood pressure. My diastolic blood pressure was fine for the entire 3 months, but my systolic blood pressure would consistently be around 125-128. That is not normal for me, and is borderline stage 1 hypertension. The fact that I even had to try to lower my blood pressure showed to me that Nandrolone is a lot harder to manage in this regard. This is consistent with almost every single person I know who has blasted high doses of Deca. They all had significant issues with blood pressure. Most of the guys who thought they had normal blood pressure were actually stage 1 hypertensive and didn't even realize that their results were indicative of cardiovascular stress. My 125-128 systolic occurred without being in a calorie surplus, without any weight changes, and on what I would consider a very low dose of NPP. The exact same diet, weight, lifestyle, etc. would have me at 110/70 on TRT. Muscle Growth And Strength On Nandrolone I maintained my muscle and do not feel that there was a substantial difference between the anabolic potency of Nandrolone compared to Testosterone. At the very least, the anabolic activity of Nandrolone is comparable to Testosterone, but the androgenic activity is far less than that of Testosterone. In certain contexts for certain individuals, Nandrolone will be the desirable alternative because of this. Reduced Libido On Nandrolone – Deca Dick? My libido was extremely subdued on NPP. That's one of the most obvious things I noticed during my experiment. I had a libido and would still want to have sex, but my libido was much lower than it is on regular TRT. On TRT I can barely go one day without sex before it starts to consume my mind.  On Nandrolone only, I can easily go a couple days barely even thinking about it. However, when it came time to get the job done, I could still get the job done and stay hard the entire time without any issues in erection quality. It was a bit harder to reach orgasm though. On top of the lack of androgenicity causing a reduction in libido, Nandrolone also has progestogenic activity and binds to the Progesterone receptor. Excessive Progesterone is notorious for killing libido and causing erectile dysfunction, and it seems that Nandrolone has similar effects in many individuals via this pathway in conjunction with its 5α-reduction into DHN. My drive was also lower, and I felt less aggressive overall. In many individuals Testosterone and DHT levels will strongly influence libido, drive, aggression, motivation and productivity. Personally, even if I have that support via DHT or DHT derivatives, the increased motivation and drive is actually more counterproductive in a work productivity context because my libido gets way too high. Even when I had high testosterone levels and 0 DHT in my body I still had sex on my mind far more than I would like. When that happens, I can barely get anything done, and then I end up depleting myself of energy for the day through excessive sex. The subdued and normalized libido on Nandrolone is welcomed for me because of this. I don't think this is necessarily just because I'm a good responder to Nandrolone, I think it has more so to do with the fact that I was using exogenous Estrogen during this experiment with the Nandrolone. Despite androgens driving aggression and drive, libido and erection quality is largely dictated by adequate Estrogen levels. With all that being said, DHT (with sufficient Estrogen via Testosterone aromatization) is blatantly better for sexual support than Nandrolone, and testosterone itself, even if you completely inhibited 5α-reductase and nuked DHT, still provides better libido and erection quality than Nandrolone does at equivalent “therapeutic” doses for the majority of people. My Blood Work Results On A Deca Only Cycle For HRT I don't like taking shots in the dark when it comes to something that I see potential in. There is a lot of theory thrown back and forth in the community on Deca only cycles, and I needed to see for myself how Nandrolone in conjunction with exogenous Estradiol would impact my personal blood work. I wanted to check markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, kidney function, Aldosterone, Prolactin, hormone levels via sensitive assay testing, and an array of other health markers that are often debated about but very infrequently actually tested for to reinforce statements made. Expectedly, high dose Deca only cycle blasts will almost always result in low HDL levels, subpar Estradiol levels, and an array of other out of range values that are less common and are more individual dependent. To date I have yet to see someone get their blood work checked with exogenous Estradiol being used in conjunction with Nandrolone at a “therapeutic” dose. This is what I wanted to evaluate. Complete Blood Count with Differential/Platelets I was actually expecting far worse from my blood test results. At a “therapeutic” dose, it doesn't seem like my hematology was negatively affected at all.   Comprehensive Metabolic Panel In my metabolic panel, nothing was really off to the point that would cause concern. My BUN being high is likely just the result of being muscular and having a high protein diet.  Lipid Panel Going into the lipid panel, we can see the number one most common blood test result among steroid users.  My HDL is low. LDL is also borderline high, but not overly concerning when I can see that my Triglycerides are pretty low. The reason why my HDL was too low was that my Estrogen levels were too low. Again, this just reinforces the fact that Nandrolone does not sufficiently aromatize into Estrogen. I will get into my Estrogen level and why it was still too low even with Estrogel administration later once we get to that part of the blood test results, but my HDL could have been in range if my Estrogen level was in check. If I didn't use the Estrogel my HDL likely would have been in the single digits. I know I can get my HDL into the reference range if my estradiol levels were doubled, which I have the leeway to do. Iron And Total Iron Binding Capacity Getting into Iron and TIBC we can see that everything looks pretty normal here.  Total Testosterone And Free Testosterone Expectedly, by assessing my Total Testosterone level via liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) and my Free Testosterone level via equilibrium ultrafiltration, we can see that my Testosterone levels were crashed. Both the total and the free were lower than a healthy female.  This is what you should see in your blood work if you’re on just Nandrolone. The only Testosterone being produced in my body was indirectly via the trace amounts of androgens produced in my adrenal cortex, which is why the value wasn't completely bottomed out at 0. I've mentioned many times the importance of getting high sensitivity testing done for hormone levels and how Nandrolone will register as Testosterone in primitive garbage blood tests. This is another great example of this. In addition to high sensitivity testing, I had the same blood tested using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) for my Total Testosterone level, and direct analog enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for my Free Testosterone level. These were the test results using the exact same blood sample with the terrible default assays that doctors will use to determine how to treat you, and that labs will give you in the majority of your blood work panels. According to ECLIA and EIA, I have a normal Total Testosterone and Free Testosterone level. Hilarious. This just one example of why getting accurate hormone testing is critical. My Testosterone levels are actually in the gutter, but the stupid primitive tests that doctors and labs give out as defaults for people is so f*cking stupid that it can't even tell the difference between Testosterone and 19-nortestosterone in my blood. Renin Activity and Aldosterone My renin activity and Aldosterone appeared to be normal.  This is one of the main things I wanted to check because there's a lot of speculation around the effect Nandrolone is going to have on Aldosterone levels. When it comes to the Deca only cycle, there's something going on that throws off homeostatic mechanisms that regulate blood pressure that does not appear to be Estrogen related or Aldosterone related. At least based on my blood work, my Aldosterone was definitely not at a level that could imply any kind of negative effect on blood pressure. My Aldosterone level was low if anything. Granted, some markers in the serum can be relatively worthless when compared to actual tissue concentrations, but at least based on my blood work, Aldosterone does not appear to be the culprit. The first thing many jump to when explaining blood pressure regulation is the effect Nandrolone supposedly has on spiking Aldosterone through the roof, but it just doesn't appear to be the case in my experience as you can see yourself here. Vitamin B12 and Folate My B12 and Folate levels were normal.  Pregnenolone Pregnenolone appeared to be normal and within the reference range for men which is notable, as many assume that Nandrolone will shut down the production of precursor steroids. That does not appear to be the case either. I assumed precursor hormone levels like Pregnenolone would be less affected than many seem to think as most circulating Pregnenolone is derived from the adrenal cortex.  Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) Expectedly, my DHT was very low. This is because I have almost no Testosterone being produced to 5α-reduce into DHT. If my Testosterone is low, my DHT will be low as well.  DHT Backdoor Pathway Contrary to popular belief, there is a backdoor pathway via Pregnenolone that can create DHT as well, which contributes to the chunk of DHT I have in my blood.  Hemoglobin A1c Hemoglobin A1c appeared to be normal at 5.1%.  Thyroxine (T4) My Free T4 was 1.28 ng/dL, which is acceptable.  DHEA-Sulfate My DHEA was in range and actually on the high end of normal. Being on exogenous Nandrolone or Testosterone does not shut down DHEA production.  Cortisol Cortisol was “normal” apparently, although it looks a bit high to me. I believe this result was mostly sleep hygiene related rather than entirely Nandrolone related.  Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) My TSH is too high. I've never had a TSH this high before. I have had a TSH in the 2's before, this isn't the first time, but never this high.  However, based on my resting heart rate and my morning waking temperature and my mid-day temperature, my metabolic rate seems to be the same as it usually is on TRT, and I have had no standout hypothyroidism symptoms. Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Expectedly, LH and FSH were undetectable.  Prolactin My Prolactin was on the low end of normal.  This was another interesting health marker to see on Nandrolone, as many will often jump to assuming that Nandrolone spikes Prolactin levels through the roof. That does not appear to be the case though. Prostate-Apecific Antigen (PSA) My PSA level was normal, and did not change from my previous blood work on Testosterone for TRT.  D-Dimer My D-Dimer was normal.  A friend of mine had a very high D-Dimer level on a Deca only cycle and he wanted me to check mine to see if there was a pattern. It looks like the elevated D-Dimer was case-specific for him and was probably caused by something completely unrelated, as my D-Dimer is normal. C-Reactive Protein C-Reactive Protein is one of the primary markers we have for assessing inflammation in the body. A C-Reactive Protein level of 0.34 mg/L is not overly concerning, although I would like to see it below 0.3 mg/L.  I had undetectable C-Reactive Protein levels in the past on TRT, and on Nandrolone it jumped up to 0.34, which is notable. Estradiol, Sensitive My Estradiol (E2) level determined via LC/MS-MS was only 15.4 pg/mL, despite administering 2.5 grams of Estrogel per day.  This was disappointing, as I would have liked to see my E2 at least around 30 pg/mL based on the amount of Estrogel I was applying daily. Evidently, my inner thigh was not absorbing the Estrogel very well. This is one of the recommended areas of application, but my results were not even close to in line with the average blood levels found in the Estrogel pharmacokinetics studies. With daily administration of 2.5 g or 5 g Estrogel (corresponding to 1.5 mg or 3 mg estradiol, respectively), mean serum estradiol concentrations of approximately 80 pg/ml (294 pmol/L) and 150 pg/ml (551 pmol/L), respectively, are maintained. Administration of Estrogel also results in increased serum estrone concentrations, producing a physiological estradiol/estrone ratio of approximately one. Therefore, serum concentrations of both estradiol and estrone and the serum estradiol/estrone ratio provided by ESTROGEL® are consistent with physiological levels observed during the follicular phase of the normal menstrual cycle. My inner thigh isn't very hairy at all as I manscape fairly regularly, so I expected at least a 40 pg/mL E2 based on the amount of Estrogel I was applying. I was overly generous with my dose based on the off chance that I would encounter an absorption issue, and my E2 was still way below where I expected it to be. Based on the pharmacokinetics outlined by Merck, 80 pg/mL is the average E2 level for someone applying 2.5 grams of Estrogel per day. There's no way I could have predicted that I would have an absorption issue so problematic that it would result in five times lower absorption than the average. If my E2 was closer to 30 pg/mL, I expect that my HDL would have been pushed into the reference range, and all Estradiol driven physiologic functions likely would have been more optimized. To me, this just reinforced further that Nandrolone is a subpar source of Estradiol as I was using a high dose of transdermal E2 and still could barely reach a satisfactory E2 level. To increase my E2 levels for similar future experiments I will either have to find a better application area, add some DMSO to my Estrogel to increase absorption, or consider Estradiol injections instead. Homocysteine My Homocysteine level was higher than I would like.  Normally my Homocysteine is closer to 8-8.5 umol/L. Earlier in the year when I did a shorter Nandrolone experiment for a month using 200 mg per week (double the dose I used for this experiment) I had a Homocysteine level around 8.5, so I doubt this spike was Nandrolone related. This is one of the main markers I always have my eye on because I am homozygous for the C667T polymorphism. Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) My GGT looked good.  I was worried that this would be cranked through the roof as it is a marker of oxidative stress. Magnesium My magnesium level looked okay.  Copper and Zinc My zinc level looked okay. My copper level may be a bit low, which I am now addressing by eating an ounce of beef liver every day.  Progesterone My Progesterone was normal, which is notable as it is another precursor hormone that many assume drops to zero when exogenous anabolic steroids are present in the body.  Insulin My insulin level was good.  Estrone Expectedly, my Estrone was a bit high.  This can be a major problem with exogenous Estradiol and Nandrolone unfortunately. Estrone Level Increase From Exogenous Estradiol The ratio of Estrone-to-Estradiol is skewed with massive elevations in Estrone with oral Estrogen administration. Fortunately, this unhealthy ratio can be avoided for the most part with transdermal Estradiol administration. High levels of serum Estrone sulfate (E1S) were found after long-term oral estrogen treatment of commonly prescribed dosages, whereas there was a small increase in E1S levels after transdermal Estradiol (E2) therapy. The mean maximum E1S levels were more than 20-fold higher with oral estradiol (E2) when compared with the 0.05 mg/day transdermal estradiol patch. This is consistent with the 20-fold higher dose of E2 when compared with the transdermal dose [R].   Estrone Level Increase From Nandrolone Nandrolone also significantly elevates concentrations of Estrone in plasma [R].  During a pilot study evaluating the possible beneficial effect of Nandrolone Decanoate (ND) on bone metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis there was a significant increase in the serum levels of Estrone [R]. Despite the fact that Estrone can convert to Estradiol, we can clearly see that the amount this actually happens in the body is minimal based on the consistently skewed ratios of androgens to Estradiol in the blood test results of Deca only users (or Nandrolone in general). Ferritin My Ferritin level is too low.  This is likely the result of phlebotomizing too frequently in 2019. Estriol My Estriol level was undetectable, which was expected.  Triiodothyronine (T3) My Free T3 level was 2.7 pg/mL.  It's not low enough for me to be overly concerned, however, it is suboptimal and should be in the low 3's at least. This is something I will need to address moving forward. With that being said, I like to look at my resting heart rate as well as my body temperature for a more accurate assessment of my metabolism, and both are where I want them to be. My waking temperature has consistently been 98 degrees Fahrenheit, and my midday temperature has consistently been 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin Expectedly, my sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was low.  While this isn't as relevant for a Nandrolone only user as Nandrolone has a very low affinity for SHBG, this is a value I would still like to see in the reference range, especially if I was on TRT. If I had the Estradiol level I was shooting for, I'm confident that my SHBG would have been in the reference range. My Overall Experience On Nandrolone And Exogenous Estrogen For HRT I was expecting to see a bunch of red flags in my blood work, but nothing really stood out as a major concern to me except for the spike in systolic blood pressure, and the high Estrone level. A before and after echocardiogram and calcium scoring would have been nice to see, but unfortunately I can only afford to do so much in these experiments, and the blood work was expensive enough as is. I felt good throughout the entire experiment, I maintained my physique, my libido and penis were functional, and my blood work looked pretty good considering that each issue was something more so related to my Estradiol administration than the Nandrolone itself. Estrone being out of range is a concern, as I would need to use even more exogenous Estradiol to achieve what I would consider a more therapeutic E2 level, which would likely push my Estrone up even higher. The difficulty in controlling the blood pressure spike is also a huge concern and could be a deal breaker. If I gave this experiment more time, it is entirely possible that certain things would have become problematic that appeared to be fine during my three month assessment, like my libido or sense of well-being. It is also possible that despite maintaining a healthy Estrogen level, the same neurological and cardiovascular issues we see in a significant amount of the Nandrolone data could still accumulate over time. In addition, healthy looking serum levels of Estradiol may not necessarily reflect adequate localized Estrogen receptor activation in each tissue. With Testosterone, there is a regulated amount of aromatization occurring in each tissue to satisfy however much Estrogen receptor (ER) activation we need. In the context of Deca only cycles, or Nandrolone monotherapy, there's nothing else I can refer to other than serum levels, my libido, sense of well-being, other cardiovascular health markers, etc. In other words, just because you feel good and your Estrogen levels look good on paper, that doesn't mean that an exogenously administered source of Estrogen is providing the same therapeutic ER activation in all tissues like it would if it were regulated via aromatase. With that being said, you could also argue the opposite as adequate receptor activation via exogenous hormone therapy is essentially all HRT boils down to to begin with in the context of any hormone. More than 95% of our endogenous Testosterone is produced in the testes. Testosterone is supplied to target tissues in the blood, just like most other hormones in the body. If you inject exogenous Testosterone, it then goes into the blood and is supplied to target tissues. If you inject anything it goes into the blood and then is carried to the areas that it is needed. Estrogen replacement has been deemed satisfactory for fulfilling the same functions as endogenously produced Estrogen in women for years, and synthetic Estrogen analogs are handed out like candy to millions of young girls (including teenagers). Is it healthy? Estrogen analogs like Ethinyl Estradiol probably aren't ideal for regulating Estrogen dependent functions, and they definitely aren't ideal for developing women who haven't fully matured. However, there is tons of data to support the fact that exogenous Estradiol is well-tolerated, has a strong safety profile, and can still fulfill physiologic functions sufficiently. In an ideal world, this would be a regulated process in the body in each tissue (aromatization). My experiments do not necessarily reflect what I believe are best practice with these hormones, which should be noted. This was an experiment, and not something that I would recommend someone else do. Using an exogenous progestogen with estrogel certainly isn't what I would consider an optimal HRT protocol, or what is indicative of an ideal means of providing androgenic and estrogenic support in tissues. With that being said, I don't see a better way to go about utilizing Nandrolone on its own for HRT. Should it even be considered as an HRT alternative though? That's the question, and I believe it is largely going to be individual dependent, with a significant amount of users having poor outcomes in one aspect or another. I do believe there are a minority of individuals who are very prone to androgenic and/or estrogenic side effects from exogenous Testosterone use that may benefit from exploring Nandrolone though, and it should not be discarded as a potentially viable alternative simply because it is not the primary bioidentical hormone that men produce.

    "content": "Testosterone Is NOT Neuroprotective, Estrogen Is – Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Neurotoxicity     Testosterone is not neuroprotective, estrogen is. A common myth circulating in the bodybuilding and TRT community is that testosterone is inherently neuroprotective and is unique from all other anabolic steroids in that regard. The reason why testosterone is neuroprotective is simply because it aromatizes at a rate that provides a sufficient amount of estradiol to balance out the androgenicity in the body. Data in rodent models using cortical cells suggests this very convincingly by showing how the aromatase inhibitor Anastrozole (Arimidex) completely eliminated the neuroprotective effects of testosterone [R].

There have been tons of studies published suggesting how much worse synthetic anabolic steroids are in contrast to testosterone for cardiovascular disease, neurotoxicity, and a myriad of other deleterious outcomes.  I believe that a significant amount of this data is exaggerated based on the fact that exogenous estrogen is never co-administered in these studies. At the end of the day, testosterone is the safest androgen at physiologic dosages.  However, I theorize that many synthetic anabolic steroids are not as dangerous as we are led to believe.  My theory is that some compounds are not inherently significantly more dangerous than testosterone, rather, it is their lack of aromatization, 5-alpha reduction, or differing affinity for off-target receptors that makes them more dangerous. The effect on estrogen receptors and how potent of a substrate an anabolic steroid is for aromatase is the main factor that impacts how viable a hormone is for consideration in a monotherapy context. DHT derivatives cannot be converted by the enzyme aromatase into an estrogen like estradiol. Nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and its derivatives (19-nors) each have their own individual affinity (or lack thereof) for estrogen receptors and interaction with aromatase, often resulting in subpar estrogen levels (exceptions to this exist such as Trestolone/MENT). Basically, I believe that some steroids may show to be significantly more cardiotoxic and neurotoxic in the data because they are always used on their own with an insufficient amount of estrogen to balance out the androgenicity in the body. The Importance Of Sufficient Estrogen Levels Healthy estrogen levels are needed for libido, erection quality, vasodilation, cardiovascular health, brain health, bone health and several other critical functions. In women the risk of cardiovascular disease spikes significantly after menopause. It isn't a coincidence that the majority of women who develop heart disease have it occur after their estrogen production has dropped to sub-male levels. If you don't have a sufficient amount of estrogen relative to androgen levels in the body, cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity levels will be significantly higher than they would be if healthy estrogen levels were sustained. From a bodybuilding perspective, estrogen is needed to optimize muscle growth, fat loss, as well as IGF-1 and growth factor production/cellular signaling. This is why heavily aromatizing steroids may indirectly result in greater growth potential and are often classified as “bulking” compounds. Anecdotally, many bodybuilders report that the most they've ever grown was during off-season mass building phases when their estrogen levels were through the roof. The Point Of A Testosterone Base Testosterone is not tissue selective and is actually a poor muscle builder milligram for milligram when compared to other synthetic anabolic steroids developed in the years following its discovery.  When it comes to nitrogen retention, on paper it is not superior to many anabolic steroids. However, it aromatizes into estradiol at a very tightly regulated rate, it is bioidentical, and our body knows exactly what to do with it. In addition, our body knows how much testosterone to bind up with SHBG, how much to free up and make available to tissues, as well as how much DHT to 5-alpha reduce to antagonize estrogen receptor activation should it get out of control. From a bodybuilding perspective, testosterone is subpar in many aspects. However, in an overall health, longevity AND bodybuilding context, testosterone cannot be beat at therapeutic dosages. By using a testosterone base or a source of sufficient estrogen the shortcomings of other anabolic agents can be attenuated to some extent, hence why testosterone is the base of most steroid cycles. The Balancing Act Of Testosterone, DHT and Estrogen Steroidogenesis in the body is carried out like a massive orchestra to regulate countless functions.  It's far more elaborate than simply testosterone, estrogen and DHT production. Even at a snapshot view, the balancing act of androgens and estrogens in the body is tightly regulated and is carried out to ensure health remains optimized. This balancing act gets more and more dysfunctional with age, poor lifestyle, poor diet, poor sleep hygiene and numerous other factors. However, the body still knows exactly what to do with testosterone, how to create an optimal opposing amount of estrogens, and how much testosterone to 5-alpha reduce into DHT to oppose excessive estrogens and support male secondary sex characteristics. When you compare clinical data on a synthetic anabolic steroid to testosterone in a monotherapy context, you have to consider that these studies are utilizing that synthetic steroid on their own, not with exogenous estrogen or any supplementary hormones that may be needed to balance out its androgenicity, lack of estrogenic activity and/or interaction with aromatase. Obviously if you take a compound that doesn't aromatize sufficiently to estrogen and compare it head to head with the bioidentical androgen that our body knows how to aromatize and 5-alpha reduce at a perfectly balanced rate, you can just imagine which is going to come out on top in a cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity context. Does this mean that a synthetic anabolic steroid compared to testosterone would not potentially be more efficacious than testosterone should those other backend pathways be supplemented to fill the gaps though? Synthetic Anabolic Steroids With Exogenous Estradiol For HRT Some individuals have underlying genetic polymorphisms and defects in sex hormone metabolism that may throw off the tightly regulated steroidogenesis pathway in a way that skews too heavily in favor of estrogen, or too heavily in favor of androgens. There are many cases in which synthetic anabolic steroids may beat out testosterone, despite testosterone on paper being the candidate of choice for most men at therapeutic dosages, and still the candidate of choice for many men at supraphysiological dosages too in a bodybuilding context. Nandrolone is a great compound to exemplify this in my opinion. It has a much lower level of androgenicity in the body due to its 5-alpha reduction into DHN, and it is also far less estrogenic than testosterone. Those who are prone to gyno, hair loss, acne or other common testosterone related side effects typically prefer nandrolone for this reason. This is why many female oral contraceptives are nandrolone analogs as well. Unfortunately, your heart and brain don't care if you have hair loss, acne, or gyno, so there can be deleterious outcomes as a result of androgen use without a sufficient amount of unopposed estrogens, or an estrogen excess without sufficient androgen opposition. In regards to nandrolone, I don't believe it has a sufficient amount of opposing estrogen to balance out its androgenicity. It activates estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) a bit via its inherent estrogenicity and it can aromatize to estrone, which can then convert to estradiol, but the amount of overall estrogenic activity it provides does not appear to be sufficient to offset its neurotoxicity or cardiotoxicity. I believe this is why most of the data found in nandrolone studies shows how horrible it is for the brain and the heart. Nandrolone is always evaluated on its own without a sufficient amount of estrogen present to provide cardiovascular and neurological support. If you shut down your natural endogenous testosterone production with an exogenous steroid, you will also shut down your natural endogenous estrogen production. Any estrogen production (or lack thereof) would then be derived from whatever exogenous steroids are being administered. This is why some synthetic steroids may not necessarily be as dangerous as we once thought, as the data we use to review their safety profiles are skewed by their lack of estrogenic support in the tissues that would otherwise be supported by testosterone aromatizing into estradiol. In the presence of sufficient estrogen, it is entirely possible that the deleterious effects of certain synthetic steroids in the body may be attenuated to some extent. The Neurotoxicity Of Testosterone, Nandrolone And Winstrol    Comparing the effect of testosterone with that of 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone) and stanozolol (Winstrol) on neurotoxicity we can clearly see that estrogen is what protects neurons in the brain, not testosterone itself. In this study, a physiologic dosage of testosterone was neuroprotective [R]. Testosterone only amplified neurotoxicity at supraphysiological dosages. The neuroprotective effect of a physiologic dosage of testosterone was completely eliminated when the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (Arimidex) was co-administered, suggesting that the intrinsic toxicity of testosterone as an androgen is only counterbalanced by its aromatization into 17β-estradiol. As opposed to testosterone, nandrolone does not appear to aromatize sufficiently into estrogen, and Winstrol does not interact with aromatase at all. As you would expect, nandrolone and Winstrol were both neurotoxic at every single dose evaluated regardless of Arimidex being co-administered or not. The anti-androgen flutamide was able to attenuate the neurotoxicity of all three androgens, thus further reinforcing that physiologic dosages of androgens without a sufficient amount of opposing estrogens, or supraphysiological dosages of androgens may facilitate neuronal death. None of the anabolic androgenic steroids in this study were toxic in the absence of NMDA, therefore suggesting that the mechanism by which unopposed androgens facilitate neuronal death is by increased vulnerability to excitotoxic insults.    Testosterone Neuroprotective Effect Of Testosterone At Physiologic Dosages Without Arimidex At physiologic dosages without an aromatase inhibitor present, testosterone has shown to have a neuroprotective effect.  Neuroprotective Effect Of Testosterone At Physiologic Dosages Is Eliminated By Arimidex It is often assumed that the androgen itself (testosterone) is what protects the brain. However, the aromatase inhibitor Arimidex completely eliminated all neuroprotective effects of testosterone at that same physiologic dosage. Arimidex (anastrozole) exacerbated neurotoxicity at every single testosterone dosage when it was co-administered.  This suggests that testosterone is not a unique androgen that is more neuroprotective than all other steroids, rather, it is its aromatization into estrogen that is neuroprotective. Neurotoxicity Of Testosterone At Suraphysiological Dosages With And Without Arimidex At supraphysiological dosages, testosterone has shown to exacerbate neurotoxicity. While its aromatization into estrogen still prevents a significant amount of neuronal death, we can clearly see that supraphysiological testosterone concentrations exacerbate neurotoxicity regardless, and supraphysiological estrogen levels will not provide dose-dependent increases in neuroprotection.  What is the takeaway from this? The data suggests that physiologic concentrations of testosterone facilitate neuroprotection in the brain via aromatization into estrogen, but there is a threshold to that neuroprotection, and supraphysiological concentrations will still be unhealthy. Nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) Neurotoxicity Of Nandrolone Regardless Of Arimidex Use Nandrolone exacerbated neurotoxicity at all dosages, regardless if it was a low concentration or a high concentration being evaluated. In addition, co-administering Arimidex had no impact on how neurotoxic nandrolone was in this model at any dosage. This suggests that nandrolone does not aromatize into a sufficient amount of estrogen, or activate estrogen receptors on its own at an amount satisfactory to provide the neuroprotective effects of healthy estrogen levels. A source of estrogen would likely be necessary to co-administer with nandrolone for it to be considered a viable monotherapy alternative in a HRT context, or as a “healthy” cycle.  Winstrol (Stanozolol) Neurotoxicity Of Winstrol Regardless Of Arimidex Use Winstrol exacerbated neurotoxicity at all dosages, regardless if it was a low concentration or a high concentration being evaluated. In addition, co-administering Arimidex had no impact on how neurotoxic Winstrol was in this model at any dosage. We already know that Winstrol does not aromatize into estrogen at all. This data suggests that a source of estrogen would be necessary to co-administer with Winstrol for it to even be considered as a viable monotherapy alternative in a HRT context, or as a “healthy” cycle.  Anti-Androgens Attenuate The Neurotoxicity Of Anabolic Androgenic Steroids Unopposed androgens with an insufficient amount of estrogen present will be cardiotoxic and neurotoxic. This is why Flutamide (an anti-androgen) was able to eliminate the neurotoxicity of nandrolone and Winstrol.   Anti-androgens have a dose-dependent response just like anabolic androgenic steroids, so there will be androgen receptor (AR) competition occurring between anti-androgens and androgens for AR binding and activation. Anti-androgens will act as competitive antagonists for AR, or as makeshift synthetic steroids themselves, albeit with significantly reduced androgenicity. Basically, depending on the anti-androgen used, they will work either by suppressing endogenous androgen production, and/or by competing for androgen receptors. How effective the anti-androgen will be at inhibiting androgens from binding to AR will be based on binding affinity, binding constant, half-life, the dosage used, and a myriad of other factors. Flutamide is non-steroidal and acts as a selective, competitive, silent antagonist of the AR. It is a primitive and subpar anti-androgen relative to more recent developments in medicine, however, it is still effective at preventing androgens from binding to androgen receptors. This is why flutamide was able to eliminate all of the neurotoxicity of nandrolone and Winstrol at all dosages. By preventing nandrolone and Winstrol from binding to androgen receptors, they are no longer able to transcribe their effects in tissues. The flutamide and Arimidex data reinforces the fact that nandrolone does not produce enough estrogen to provide the neuroprotection needed to stave off neuronal death. With or without an aromatase inhibitor, nandrolone exacerbates neurotoxicity just the same. Without an aromatase inhibitor but with an anti-androgen, the neurotoxicity of Nandrolone is eliminated entirely. I suspect that the same applies for the inherent cardiotoxicity of nandrolone as well. Expectedly, the same applies for Winstrol as it is not a substrate for aromatase at all. This is where all the studies showing how terrible nandrolone is for the heart and brain come into question, as those negative outcomes found in the data may not have been so drastic if an exogenous source of estrogen was co-administered. The same dosage of flutamide was unable to fully offset the neurotoxicity of testosterone at supraphysiological dosages without Arimidex present.  Once testosterone dosages exceed physiologic concentrations, the vulnerability to neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity skyrockets. Too much of anything in the body is going to be bad, and testosterone is not exempt from this just because its the bioidentical hormone we naturally produce and aromatize into estrogen. The Aromatization Of Androgens Into Estrogen Is What Regulates Neurotoxicity Reflecting on the data with and without an aromatase inhibitor we can see quite clearly that estrogen is what facilitates neuroprotection, not testosterone. Many assume that testosterone is a unique androgen that binds to AR in some special way that's going to protect the brain and other steroids are going to destroy the brain. I don't think it's as cut and dry as that. I think it's pretty clear in the data that with anastrozole co-administered the neuroprotective effect is wiped out, and without anastrozole there is a neuroprotective effect.  What is the difference between aromatase being inhibited and aromatase not being inhibited? It is the estrogen level in the body. If you have a sufficient amount of estrogen to balance out androgens in the body, you get a good stable level of neuroprotection, which is reflected in how our body regulates endogenous androgen aromatization as is. But, if you have a supraphysiological level of androgens, or inhibit aromatase from providing the estrogen needed to carry out necessary functions in the body, neurotoxicity spikes up regardless of the fact that it is testosterone being evaluated, not a non-bioidentical synthetic anabolic steroid. This all circles back to the rationale behind using a testosterone base on cycle, or having a sufficient source of exogenous estrogen if you are deficient. It also reinforces that aromatase inhibitors are horrible for you if used unnecessarily. My Stance On Aromatase Inhibitors You would be well served by doing whatever you can to avoid using aromatase inhibitors. If you even need an aromatase inhibitor in the first place you're likely either using too much testosterone to begin with (or other aromatizing steroids), you're too fat (more fat = more aromatase), your diet sucks, your lifestyle choices are poor, or you're injecting too infrequently. Or you might have a genetic polymorphism that results in subpar sex hormone metabolism. At the end of the day, the likelihood that you would need an AI to handle a truly therapeutic dose of testosterone if you've optimized everything is extremely low. In a bodybuilding context at supraphysiological dosages, I also think that in most cases using an AI just so you can use “too high” of a testosterone dose is a poor strategy. Should You Take Exogenous Estrogen To Prevent Neurotoxicity And Cardiotoxicity Just because estrogen is what provides neuroprotection, not testosterone, it absolutely does not mean that you should start popping your girlfriend's birth control pills like candy. Unopposed estrogen in the body is carcinogenic. There is a reason why the first go to treatments for breast cancer are SERMs and aromatase inhibitors. Also, estrogen does not provide neuroprotection in a dose dependent manner. There is a sweet spot for everything in the body, and too much of anything is going to be bad. A 4-day pretreatment with low concentrations 0.01 μM (10 nM) of 17β-estradiol was substantially neuroprotective against NMDA toxicity.  However, you can clearly see that there was not a dose dependent decrease in neurotoxicity in this study. Neuroprotection was significantly lower with 1 μM 17β-estradiol than with the much lower dosage of 0.01 μM 17β-estradiol.  More is not better with anything in the body. The body has a tightly regulated system in place whereby a certain amount of estrogen is needed for physiologic functions. Too much estrogen without enough androgens can result in cancer development, gynecomastia (gyno), and a myriad of other issues. Too little estrogen and excessive androgens can result in cardiovascular disease, neuronal death, and a myriad of other issues. So, if you are using an androgen without a sufficient amount of opposing estrogen to balance it out, you will not only be inhibiting muscle growth and fat loss, but you will be putting your body in an even more quickly deteriorating state of health than you would have already been in regardless simply as a result of supraphysiological androgen levels. If you are using a TRT dose of testosterone, you would be best served by not unnecessarily inhibiting aromatase. Also, if you are using an anabolic steroid that is not a potent substrate for aromatase, you would be best served by adding a testosterone base or a source of adequate estrogen to your cycle. The interesting thing to evaluate would be whether all of the anabolic steroids previously described by the literature as horrendous for the heart and brain would still be described as such if an adequate dosage of exogenous estrogen was used in conjunction with them in the corresponding studies. It certainly opens the mind up to potential hormone replacement therapy alternatives, hence my experimentation in the past with Trestolone monotherapy, low dose Nandrolone with exogenous estradiol, and SARMs with exogenous estradiol.

    "content": "Kevin Levrone’s Steroid Cycles And How Much Muscle He Gained From Each     Kevin Levrone is among professional bodybuilders like Dorian Yates who have opened up about their steroid cycles and dosages. In an interview with Muscular Development Kevin Levrone outlined his first and second steroid cycles with specific details, which gives us great insight into what kind of compounds and dosages he used to build his physique up. Levrone went through only a handful of cycles before he ended up on the Olympia stage. It's insane to think that within just a couple years of steroid use Kevin was already standing on stage beside Dorian Yates placing 2nd at the 1992 Mr. Olympia. Kevin Levrone story is one of the best examples in history of elite genetic response to steroids.  Kevin Levrone's First Steroid Cycle Kevin Levrone started his first steroid cycle at 24 years old, six weeks out of his first competition (the 1990 NPC Maryland State Championship). Kevin first steroid cycle was comprised of:  Testosterone Cypionate – 400 mg per week  During that went from 198 pounds up to 206 pounds six weeks later while simultaneously burning fat.  Although we are only able to have a glimpse of what his physique looks like after that first cycle due to the limited number of available photos, we can get a fair idea of the kind of musculature he was displaying at that first show.  When it comes to testosterone use (and steroids in general), an increase in fat-free mass doesn't necessarily mean that the body weight is comprised of only contractile tissue. This is often overlooked and is evidently exaggerated in the clinical data on graded dose response to testosterone in healthy young men. Because of this, we need to speculate a bit on how much weight Kevin actually gained during this first cycle of actual pure muscle. Based on an 8 pound gain, the simultaneous drop in body fat, and Kevin's body composition he showed on stage at that first show, we can surmise that he probably gained around 10 pounds of muscle during that 6 week cycle. Kevin Levrone's Second Steroid Cycle After winning the 1990 NPC Maryland State Championship, Kevin had some time to eat in a calorie surplus and actually have a full off-season before his next pro qualifier show. Kevin's second steroid cycle is far more indicative of his genetic response to anabolics as his first cycle was only six weeks long and didn't have as much leniency in regards to his calorie allotment. Kevin's second steroid cycle was comprised of:  Testosterone Cypionate – 600 mg per week Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca) – 400 mg per week Anadrol – 100 mg per day  That comes to 1700 mg per AAS per week for his second cycle. Despite that being a fairly aggressive second cycle, Kevin claims he has never experienced negative side effects throughout his entire career. This second cycle is what allowed Kevin to pack on 30 pounds of fat-free mass between 1990 and nationals in 1991. Kevin Levrone's Contest Prep Cycle For contest prep Kevin would add in androgenic hardening agents and let the more water retensive drugs work out of his system. At the start of contest prep Kevin added in four amps of Winstrol per week, split into twice weekly administration (2 amps administered twice per week). Winstrol V came in 50-milligram amps, so his weekly Winstrol dosage was 200 milligrams. At four weeks out, Kevin dropped the Testosterone, Nandrolone and Anadrol. At two weeks out Kevin added in 20 milligrams per day of Halotestin tabs, and would go into shows on Winstrol and Halo only. Between 1990 and 1991, Kevin's stage weight increased from 206 pounds to 236 pounds. A 10 pound stage weight increase per year I would consider a VERY successful off-season.   Kevin managed to put on 30 during his first off-season, and found himself on the Olympia stage placing second to Dorian Yates within 2 years of his first steroid cycle.

    "content": "Reacting To And Analyzing Dorian Yates’ First Steroid Cycle     As more and more IFBB pros and past Mr. Olympia winners like Dorian Yates start to open up over social media about their steroid use, we have started to get incredibly detailed insight into things like their genetic response to their first steroid cycle. From a very early age, it was pretty obvious that Dorian Yates was different from the rest and had a hyper-response to training and anabolics. A lot of people look to Dorian Yates as the pinnacle example of “hard work beats talent” and how “genetics aren't everything”. A bit of delusion has been created stemming from Dorian's training philosophies whereby many have truly started to believe that you can just grind harder than the next guy in the gym and completely make up for lacklustre genetics. The reality is that Dorian actually has some of the most insane bodybuilding genetics of all time. His biceps were a bit average compared to the rest of him, but other than that there was literally nothing wrong with his genetics at all, and the reason he became Mr. Olympia in the first place was his incredibly superior genetics. This is what Dorian looked like prior to training. Dorian Yates After 6 Months Of Natural Training Dorian stepped on stage for his first bodybuilding event only 6 months after starting training at 21 years old. This event was at the Temple Hotel across the street from the gym that he worked out at. This is a picture of him posing at that event at the Temple Hotel Birmingham in 1984.  According to him, this is after 6 months of natural training. 6 MONTHS! He's already bigger than almost every single person you would see at your local gym who have been training years. After 9 Months of Natural Training After only 9 months of natural training, Dorian already looked like a bodybuilder and had surpassed 99.9% of the population who has been working out for years. I see guys on gear constantly who look much worse than this that have been cranking for years.  This is not something that can be attributed solely to “hard work beats talent”. Dorian Yates' Progress From His First Steroid Cycle Moving forward to 1985, Dorian did his first steroid cycle to prepare for his first official bodybuilding competition, the Novice West Coast (England). This is what he looked like at that first show.  At the Novice West Coast Dorian placed first and shortly thereafter went to the World Games in London and placed 7th. This is after his first cycle, which was only 18 months after starting training. Within a year and a half, Dorian had already packed on what appears to be upwards of 40-50 pounds of pure muscle. Dorian Yates' First Steroid Cycle Quoting Dorian from an interview he did on his steroid use, his first cycle was as follows:  It was 1985. I was 23 years old and had decided to enter my first competition after a year and a half of training, in which I had made excellent progress. I knew the others who would be competing would be using gear, and I wanted to even the playing field. It was a very deliberate decision that I didn’t take lightly, and I did as much reading as I could first. At 23, I feel I was old enough. At that age, you are fully matured physically, you’ve reached your full adult height, and so on. Even though I hadn’t been training terribly long, I had already managed to develop my physique to a decent level. Looking back, I may have been able to win that contest without using anything. I did one six-week “building” cycle of 20 milligrams of Dianabol a day, which took me from 215 at 5’11” to 235. Those were the most dramatic results I ever saw from steroids. I took six weeks off the gear, then at eight weeks out from my contest I began using 15 milligrams of Anavar per day, as well as one shot of Primobolan a week, which was 200 milligrams. I competed at around 210-215 and won that contest. EFBB [Britain’s equivalent of the NPC] officials were there and convinced me to represent the United Kingdom the following weekend as our heavyweight at the IFBB World Games. I placed seventh, and competed with men like Berry de Mey and Matt Mendenhall, both of whom were the top amateur heavyweights in their respective nations at that time. – Dorian Yates  Dorian Yates Rate Of Muscle Growth At the 1985 show, we see Dorian displaying an insane level of progression relative to what he looked like in the Temple Gym photoshoot in 1984. There's a reason he became Mr. Olympia in the first place, and anyone who wants to argue that his training intensity, workout split, and training past failure is the reason he made such ridiculous progress is delusional in my opinion. Dorian gained upwards of what looks to be 20-30 pounds of stage weight per year until he won the Olympia. Even on what many would consider baby dosages of gear, he still easily swept high level bodybuilding shows and gained muscle at an incredibly fast rate. You can't attribute that progress to just “he trained harder than everyone else”.

As you probably already know, Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are a class of androgen receptor ligands that bind to androgen receptors and exert tissue selective anabolic effects with a relative lack of androgenicity when compared to traditional anabolic steroids. The end goal of their continued development is more or less to create the ultimate anabolic agent that can completely offset tissue loss as a result of musculoskeletal degenerative diseases, with a complete absence of androgenic activity in the body. While certain SARMs are closer to reaching this goal than others, the perfect SARM has yet to be developed. However, that doesn't mean that the SARMs currently developed cannot be leveraged in some capacity for a variety of potential applications. As alternatives to oral SARMs, topical SARMs may be a promising area of research in the fight against hair loss. This article highlights the reasons why I believe there is such therapeutic promise in topical SARMs for hair loss prevention.

However, the effects of exogenous androgens on the human body will inevitably vary between individuals due to several dependant factors in this cascade. As a rule of thumb, raising androgen levels via exogenous androgens will generally initiate or accelerate hair loss for someone who is hair loss prone. Unfortunately, anabolic steroids will unavoidably bring along some degree of concurrent androgenic activity. Our natural endogenously produced steroids are not an exception to this, and the androgen load in the body needs to be addressed in some capacity to attenuate, or even reverse hair loss. Standard Treatments For Hair Loss: Finasteride And Dutasteride Finasteride and Dutasteride are medications designed to treat hair loss by inhibiting the enzymatic process responsible for DHT production. This means that they are not anti-androgens that bind to androgen receptors, but rather they prevent the body from converting testosterone into the much more androgenic metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by inhibiting the enzyme 5-alpha reductase. A 5 mg dose of Finasteride per day will inhibit approximately 70 percent of the body's systemic DHT, in comparison to 0.5 mg Dutasteride; which inhibits 90 to 99 percent of the body's systemic DHT. For most individuals, androgenic activity caused by DHT will be minimized after Dutasteride serum concentrations have peaked in the body, as there will simply be barely any DHT left. However, even with a high dose of Dutasteride, scalp DHT levels may not be diminished enough to completely deprive the tissues of DHT, and there is a substantial concurrent spike in scalp testosterone levels as a result of the blockade created at 5-alpha reductase. Not only is there potential for residual scalp DHT, but you if you rely on a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor as a form of hair loss prevention monotherapy you will still have a significant amount of testosterone unaccounted for in your body that still has its own inherent androgenic activity. I've posted a video on this before, where I review my over one year long experiment with Dutasteride where I lowered my DHT to undetectable levels and increased my testosterone levels into borderline supraphysiological territory.  The inherent androgenicity of testosterone was still substantial enough to progress my androgenic alopecia. In fact, I still had all the characteristics of androgenic activity:  facial hair growth body hair growth (albeit notably reduced, which is to be expected) high libido morning wood and good erectile quality hair loss  In contrast to 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, a compound that reduces androgenic activity in the scalp by effectively targeting the androgen receptors would be more efficacious in staving off further hair loss progression. This is what prompted the development of anti-androgens. Transgender Hormone Therapy (Male-To-Female) For Hair Loss Prevention During the process of male-to-female gender transitioning, one of the first things doctors would do is prescribe estrogen or an estrogen analog to crush endogenous testosterone levels while increasing feminine hormones. They may also introduce anti-androgens to the protocol to further reduce the amount of androgenic activity in the body. One of the side effects of gender transitioning via anti-androgen and estrogen therapy is significant scalp hair regrowth, and complete reversal in even some of the most extreme cases. In some instances, men with nearly slick bald heads have grown back pre-puberty heads of hair via this kind of protocol. While this is clearly the most extreme method of reversing androgenic alopecia, you can't argue with the results it produces in individuals who feel the risk/reward is worth it, or simply desire to become more feminine. Certain non-steroidal anti-androgens that interact with androgen receptors are designed to compete with testosterone and DHT for androgen receptor binding, while other steroidal anti-androgens work through slightly different mechanisms, albeit still working around the biological target of endogenous androgens (the androgen receptor). For the sake of not overcomplicating this section with too much scientific jargon, I'm going briefly summarize the pharmacodynamics of the two most commonly used anti-androgens in the hair loss prevention community, and elaborate on how SARMs may stack up to them. Bicalutamide Bicalutamide is a non-steroidal anti-androgen that is recognized for its affinity to androgen receptors, thus preventing testosterone and DHT from binding and transcribing their effects in tissues. Bicalutamide is a highly selective competitive silent antagonist of the androgen receptor, and is often utilized in androgen deprivation protocols, both clinically and experimentally. A common feature of pure anti-androgens, such as Hydroxyflutamide and Casodex (Bicalutamide), is their relatively weak binding affinity for the androgen receptor, 50–100 times less than that of Testosterone [R]. On paper, it doesn't seem like Bicalutamide would be very effective at preventing hair loss because of its weak binding affinity. However, the typical prescribed dosages of Bicalutamide are high enough that so much of the drug gets into the system that it essentially overpowers testosterone and DHT for androgen receptor binding. The logic behind this protocol is basically that the drug is poor at what it is designed to do, and for it to work it needs to be dosed extremely high until there is just so much of it circulating in the body that it overpowers testosterone and DHT by sheer volume. The half-life of Bicalutamide is 5-10 days as well (depending on single vs. continuous dosing), consequently allowing serum concentrations of the drug to accumulate far more over time. By creating a blockade of the androgen receptor, bicalutamide prevents the negative feedback androgens would normally create via the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) in men. As a result of this, luteinizing hormone (LH) spikes in the body as the body recognizes a need to produce more androgens. After LH spikes, the gonads produce more testosterone, and more of that testosterone 5-alpha reduces into DHT, as well as aromatizes into estrogen. 150 mg Bicalutamide per day in men has shown to increase testosterone levels by 59-97%, increase estrogen levels by 65-146%, as well as increase DHT, SHBG and prolactin to a less significant degree. This significant spike in estrogen will often lead to estrogenic side effects during Bicalutamide monotherapy. Gynecomastia is a very common occurrence during Bicalutamide monotherapy. Cyproterone Acetate In contrast to the non-steroidal anti-androgen Bicalutamide, the steroidal anti-androgen Cyproterone acetate works by suppressing testosterone production directly, as well as competing for androgen receptors. Cyproterone acetate is one of the first anti-androgens developed, but it is still one of the most effective to date for hair loss prevention. With that being said, it has also shown to be one of the most side effect ridden compounds used for this purpose. Cyproterone acetate was originally clinically deployed to “treat” hypersexuality and sexual deviation. It was also used to delay precocious puberty. When puberty begins before age 8 in girls and before age 9 in boys, it is considered “precocious puberty”. As cyproterone acetate was used both in full grown men as well as pre-pubescent children, the conflicting findings in its pharmacodynamics have led to differing conclusions on how it works in the body, but for the sake of this article being about full grown men preventing hair loss, we will obviously be evaluating the clinical data on full grown men. Cyproterone acetate causes a prompt drop in LH and FSH levels, and consequently a massive drop in testosterone levels. In a study conducted on healthy male sexual offenders, dosing 50 mg cyproterone acetate twice daily caused testosterone levels to fall to subnormal levels within 1 week [R].  Cyproterone acetate has the highest anti-androgenic activity of any other clinically used progestin. Despite it having a fairly weak binding affinity when compared to DHT and testosterone, Cyproterone acetate works similarly to Bicalutamide in that it accumulates during daily dosing because of its 1.6–4.3 day half-life, and also is dosed high enough clinically to increase serum concentrations high enough to a point whereby it can effectively compete for AR via sheer volume. In addition, because Cyproterone acetate significantly reduces testosterone production (and by extension DHT production) via its progestogenic activity, there are less endogenous androgens for Cyproterone acetate to compete with for AR as it accumulates, consequently making it very effective at displacing androgens at AR and inducing systemic anti-androgen activity. Cyproterone Acetate Vs. Bicalutamide Steroidal anti-androgens have largely been replaced now by non-steroidal anti-androgens clinically, but cyproterone acetate and spironolactone are still commonly used in the management of feminizing hormone therapy. Cyproterone acetate is more effective at reversing hair loss than Bicalutamide anecdotally, but also comes with a significantly elevated risk profile associated with its use. Maintaining Masculinity Vs. Your Hair While oral anti-androgens certainly work to reduce androgenic activity in the scalp, they also will often cause a variety of undesired side effects. Aside from the actual health concerns in regards to hepatotoxicity, musculoskeletal degeneration, and more, the main thing we are going to focus on is the effect anti-androgens have on your literal manhood. Expectedly, anti-androgens can cause feminization, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, as well as muscle and bone loss. Now, like I mentioned, non-steroidal anti-androgens like Bicalutamide are substantially better in this regard, whereby they will not cause musculoskeletal degeneration, will maintain relatively normal sex hormone levels, and do not have many of the drawbacks of steroidal anti-androgens [R]. However, that doesn't mean that they are ideal, as they can still throw off the balance of androgens to estrogens in the body and prevent you from improving your body composition. Anything inhibiting testosterone from binding to androgen receptors in muscle and bone and transcribing anabolic effects will get in the way of your body composition goals at the end of the day. Inhibiting DHT and testosterone from binding to androgen receptors systemically will also impede countless physiologic processes that are facilitated via endogenous androgens in the body. This isn't a flaw of the drug necessarily, as it is doing exactly what it was designed to do. However, androgen deprivation does not complement most of our goals as men, nor does it complement our health and quality of life. We want androgen deprivation in the scalp only, with no alteration of our systemic hormones or health markers. Obviously this is easier said than done, or else we would already have a topical anti-androgen available that stays localized, has a higher binding affinity than DHT, and has no systemic absorption. This compound does not exist, so we have to make do with our current pharmacology and understanding of pharmacodynamics. Oral Anti-Androgens Vs. Topical Anti-Androgens Many would question why we don't just use Cyproterone acetate or Bicalutamide topically to achieve this. The reason why these fall short as topical treatments essentially boils down to the fact that their binding affinity is poor, and their success as anti-androgens is largely achieved via their accumulation in the body systemically. When it comes to topical treatments, we don't want something with a week long half-life, as it will start to accumulate in the body and cause systemic anti-androgen effects. The ideal compound would be something that has a short half-life, a high binding affinity for androgen receptors, and acts as a highly selective competitive silent antagonist in the scalp exclusively. The closest we have come to this so far is RU58841, with CB-03-01 showing therapeutic promise as well despite having a much lower binding affinity.  A compound that does not convert to deleterious metabolites systemically is also advantageous, as there will unavoidably be some level of systemic absorption with any molecule that is small enough to penetrate the stratum corneum after topical application. While current topical anti-androgens commercially available do work for some individuals, there are limitations to each which I have delved into before. There is no perfect treatment at the moment, but in this article I elaborate on something I feel is worth further exploration when it comes to creating a strong localized androgen receptor blockade with as minimal of a systemic impact as possible. How Anti-Androgens Are Related To SARMs For Hair Loss At the end of the day, how does this all intertwine with SARMs? The bodybuilding community, the hair loss prevention community, and the research between them actually intersects in many ways that are commonly overlooked. I first realized the therapeutic promise of SARMs in a hair loss prevention capacity when I saw someone stop their hair loss cold turkey with the SARM S4 and exogenous Estradiol. What many don't realize is that non-steroidal SARMs like S4 were synthesized using the chemical structure of traditional anti-androgens like Bicalutamide as their backbone. The most promising SARMs exhibit binding affinities several times higher than these anti-androgens, and I feel are an extremely promising area of untapped research for hair loss prevention.  Some SARMs at certain dosages have shown to be as anti-androgenic as compounds like Bicalutamide and Hydroxyflutamide, more anti-androgenic than Finasteride, but with the benefit of actual tissue selective anabolic activity in muscle and bone.  Basically, some SARMs can prevent hair loss better than Finasteride, as well as traditional anti-androgens, all while allowing supraphysiological muscle growth. The reason this is possible is that most SARMs have much higher binding affinities than traditional anti-androgens and can be far more effective at competing with endogenous androgens for AR binding and activation. In addition, because they are tissue selective, once they bind to androgen receptors, they induce anabolic activity in muscle and bone with a relative lack of androgenicity in other tissues like the prostate and scalp. I detail how this works further in one of my older articles called “Do SARMs Cause Hair Loss? | Can SARMs Prevent Hair Loss“. Oral SARMs also lower SHBG and can have a suppressive effect on endogenous androgen production at high enough dosages (and even low dosages with some SARMs). Through this suppression, SARMs can lower the androgen load in the body even further. With long-term use, certain SARMs may suppress endogenous testosterone production enough that the use of estrogen alongside the SARM becomes a necessity if aromatization is no longer satisfactory to maintain healthy estradiol levels. This presents an interesting scenario whereby androgen levels can be crushed to nearly undetectable levels via a non-steroidal SARM, and the additional negative feedback provided by the exogenous estradiol being added to the protocol to maintain therapeutic estrogen levels. The end result of this is essentially a heavy duty anti-androgen protocol that can maintain significantly more muscle mass than what is possible via traditional androgen deprivation therapy. However, oral SARMs obviously have their limitations as suppression of endogenous androgens is going to result in decreased libido, drive, and overall masculinity. While many who use traditional anti-androgens don't care about this as they simply want the most efficacious way to nuke their hair loss, there are going to be many individuals who want to minimize the systemic impact of any treatment they deploy to keep their hair. This is where I believe there is therapeutic promise in topical SARMs. Difference Between Topical SARMs For Hair Loss And Topical Anti-Androgens SARMs and anti-androgens are both effective at inhibiting gene transcription via androgen receptor competition. By competing against endogenous androgens for androgen receptor binding, topical anti-androgens like RU58841 and CB-03-01 are effective at preventing hair loss completely for some individuals with mild hair loss, and moderately effective at providing at least a decent foundation of protection for some individuals with more aggressive hair loss. One limitation of topical anti-androgens is that they work in a dose-dependent manner, but can wreak havoc if they get systemic. As I showed earlier with Bicalutamide, the higher volume of drug present, the more difficult it is for testosterone and DHT to bind to vacant androgen receptors. With anti-androgens its not as simple as increasing the dose until it works though, as topical solutions will go systemic to some extent, and the more drug you introduce to your system, the more anti-androgen activity you will get systemically. For someone with aggressive hair loss, chasing the volume approach with topical anti-androgens to overwhelm the endogenous androgens present in the scalp may lead to significant systemic side effects before adequate androgen receptor competition to prevent hair loss is even achieved. SARMs on the other hand will have a negligible impact on endogenous androgen production when trickling into the system in trace amounts, and will not induce anti-androgen activity in muscle and bone even if a substantial amount of it does get into the bloodstream.     SARMs Anti-Androgens   Comparable Binding Affinity To Testosterone For Androgen Receptors SOME SOME   Transcription Of Anabolic Affects YES NO   Transcription Of Androgenic Affects MINIMIZED NO   Side Effects To Systemic Introduction MINOR MAJOR    How SARMs May Complement Finasteride Or Dutasteride As DHT has a binding affinity higher than all SARMs, and significantly higher than all anti-androgens, if sufficient AR competition could not be achieved locally via a SARM or anti-androgen to stave off androgenic alopecia, then a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor could then be looked at as a potential adjunct treatment to use concurrently. By dropping systemic DHT levels via 5-alpha reductase inhibition, competing for AR becomes significantly easier for us as we have compounds at our disposal that are actually comparable to testosterone in binding affinity. The 500 Dalton Rule For The Skin Penetration Of Chemical Compounds And Drugs The molecular weight of a compound must be under 500 Dalton to allow skin absorption [R]. Larger molecules cannot pass the corneal layer. The Dalton is used as a unit of molar mass, especially in biochemistry. 1 Da (dalton) = 1 g/mol. The Most Promising SARMs For Hair Loss Prevention Taking S4 (Andarine) as an example, you can see that the molecular weight is 441.4 g/mol [R]. Because S4 has a molecular weight of 441.4 daltons, it can pass the corneal layer and work to some extent topically. I'm using S4 as an example simply because it seems to be the most hair safe SARM of all to date via oral administration, and is also the only SARM I have seen used topically so far. It is also the only SARM I've seen used orally in conjunction with exogenous estradiol for over a year straight so far with great success and no notable deleterious effects to liver enzymes or other health markers that are commonly impaired with high dosages of oral SARMs. With that being said, S4 isn't without its potential issues itself. SARMs are still uncharted waters, but there are several that have been well tolerated in a clinical setting at dosages several times higher than what we would be using for hair loss prevention, or even for muscle growth in a bodybuilding context in a few token scenarios. While S4 has shown to be the most promising SARM in a hair loss prevention context to date, I am confident that other alternatives with improved binding affinities, high tissue selectivity, and high tolerability clinically in actual human subjects would likely result in similar positive outcomes if the dosing was nailed down. For example, LGD-4033 has a molecular weight of 338.25 daltons and has shown to be well tolerated in humans at dosages as high as 22 mg per day orally [R]. It has also binds to the androgen receptor with an extremely high affinity (Ki of ~1 nM), which is superior to every other SARM tested on humans with comparable tissue selectivity. In addition, a preclinical rodent model showed that it has greater than 500-fold selectivity of muscle tissue to prostate when compared to testosterone. LGD-4033 Selectivity For Muscle To Prostate Compared To Testosterone A greater than 500:1 anabolic to androgenic selectivity would make LGD-4033 the most tissue selective SARM to date. However, in practical application, LGD-4033 seems several times more androgenic than S4, although it is also several times more anabolic milligram for milligram. Some individuals even report hair loss with LGD-4033 use. Context is key here though, as the individuals reporting hair loss are using dosages 10x higher than the dosage being evaluated in humans clinically, and it is not clear whether this is telogen effluvium or actual androgenic alopecia progression even in these mega-dosing cases. This is what I mean by the dosing needs to be nailed down with these compounds, as haphazard overdosing could easily lead to unexpected androgenic activity, or induce telogen effluvium via a significant shift in endogenous hormones. There is no SARM that is completely devoid of androgenic activity, so dose response needs to be carefully assessed when experimentation is done with these compounds. Anabolism as a Systemic Effect of Topical SARMs for Hair Loss One of the limitations of anti-androgens is that when they go systemic they can induce anti-androgenic activity in other tissues. SARMs on the other hand bind to androgen receptors and induce tissue selective anabolic activity. So, the theory here is that we can potentially use a lower dose of a SARM topically than we would need with an anti-androgen, and achieve a substantial anti-androgenic effect via a much lower dosage, and even if it were to go systemic to some extent, then the worst that happens is we get some anabolic activity in muscle and bone. In theory, it sounds great, but SARMs will still suppress endogenous androgen production to some extent, lower SHBG, and potentially induce some hepatic stress when systemic. However, the degree to which this occurs should be much lower than what occurs with traditional anti-androgens. This is all theoretical at the end of the day, as SARMs may not even compete for AR activation in the scalp. However, anecdotally via oral administration it seems fairly obvious that they do in all tissues in the body, despite having “selective” action. If a topical anti-androgen works, then a topical SARM should work in a similar way. SARMs are essentially just chemically modified anti-androgens with better binding affinity and anabolic activity after all. Efficacy Profile Of Topical SARMs For Men Wanting To Retain Masculinity For many men, hair is a huge part of their identity and plays a massive role in looking good. Unfortunately, we've been put in a position biologically where the more androgens in our body, the more expedited our hair loss progression will be, and all effective anabolic agents have some level of androgenicity. So, in a perfect world, we would be able to utilize SARMs (or something like SARMs) to selectively occupy androgen receptors in the scalp, and leave the rest of the body alone. Topical SARMs For Hair Loss Prevention: A Viable Long-term Strategy? While SARMs are still very new, there are already SARMs with comparable binding affinities to testosterone that have shown to have no virilizing effects in women at fairly high dosages orally. Topically, we may be able to achieve more localized action on androgen receptors and minimize the systemic impact in the body. I believe there are better ways to manage hair loss than blindly crushing androgen levels with primitive medications. SARMs may or may not be the answer, but they are certainly a step forward and could very likely be used effectively as a form of monotherapy in some users, or as an adjunct treatment alongside tried and true compounds that do a significant amount of the heavy lifting, and then let a SARM clean up the mess leftover. Are SARMs perfect? No, they aren't. However, some of the SARMs currently developed may already have more therapeutic promise for some individuals than traditional anti-androgens used for hair loss prevention. At the very least, they are worth exploring more in this context, and I believe are potentially a more progressive way to go about handling excessive androgenic activity via AR activation in the scalp. In addition, injectable SARMs are a new area I'm researching that may also have therapeutic promise as well. How To Create A Topical SARM The ideal scenario would be that we mix a SARM into a topical solution that has shown to not only be very tissue selective with a high binding affinity, but has also shown to be well-tolerated in humans in a clinical setting with no deleterious outcomes, and then apply that solution topically to bind locally to androgen receptors and compete with testosterone and DHT for AR activation. Standard vehicles (the carrier solution you mix the compound in for topical application) should work similarly to anti-androgens. My guess is that a 70% ethanol/30% propylene glycol vehicle would suffice. A PEG 400 mixture may be a useful alternative vehicle for those with intolerance to propylene glycol, or those with vehicle-dependent contact allergy to SARMs in either propylene or hexylene glycol [R]. Adding a bit of DMSO or daily microneedling with a short length pretreatment may need to be incorporated for absorption for those with less permeable skin. What concentration the solution should be remains up in the air and will need to be determined via experimentation. Following the dosage outlines used in a therapeutic setting, we can get a well-tolerated starting point. For example, with LGD-4033, orally it has a tissue selective anabolic effect at dosages as low as 0.1 mg per day, and has shown to be well-tolerated as high as 22 mg per day. The most notable clinical trial on LGD-4033 utilized 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg orally for 12 weeks. LGD-4033 exhibited encouraging safety and tolerability, and there were no drug-related serious adverse events in the study [R]. A good starting point would be 0.5 mg LGD-4033 per day topically, with the dosage titrated up accordingly based on dose-response. The only SARM I've seen used topically to date is S4. As S4 does not have any human data, we had to design the protocol based around anecdotal findings and extrapolated clinical data on rodent models. Anecdotally, orally administered S4 does not induce night vision side effects until around 30-50 mg per day. A topically administered dosage of 25 mg per day produced a very quick reduction in sebum in the scalp, which is a very obvious marker of reduced androgenic activity. Scalp itch was also severely decreased, with no notable side effects. Notably, the individual who I oversaw who did this experiment gets horrible side effects from every single hair loss prevention compound he has tried. He's one of the unfortunate ones who gets brutal 5-alpha reductase inhibitor side effects, systemic anti-androgen side effects with topical anti-androgen use, and even severely impaired sleep with PGD2 inhibitors. The fact that he had no issues with topical S4 was very promising, and piqued my interest in the area even more (which is partially what has led me to my current injectable SARMs experiment I am conducting on myself). Does that mean this is a viable long-term strategy? That remains to be seen with further experimentation. To be clear, this is still a theoretical approach to topical hair loss prevention, and is geared mostly towards individuals who have experienced negative side effects with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, RU58841 and CB-03-01.

    "content": "The Only Steroids Finasteride Will Prevent Hair Loss From     There's a misconception that Finasteride is a reliable source of remedy for hair loss prevention caused by the intake of all anabolic steroids. For anyone who has reviewed the downstream mechanisms of Finasteride in the body, it is clear that this is not true. Below are the details to a realistic set of expectations from Finasteride use with anabolic steroids.   Table of Contents ToggleNot All Steroids Convert to DHT via 5-Alpha ReductaseTestosterone vs. Other Anabolic Steroids as a Catalyst for Hair LossAnabolic Steroid Interaction With 5-Alpha ReductaseFinasteride Only Prevents DHT Derived Hair LossThe Steroids Finasteride Or Dutasteride Can Protect Your Hair FromRelated Not All Steroids Convert to DHT via 5-Alpha Reductase An assumption that must be ruled out is the idea that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) will always be the by-product of metabolic reactions between 5-alpha reductase and an anabolic steroid. 5-alpha reductase is an enzyme involved in steroid metabolism that can create androgenic metabolites (e.g. DHT) via a process called “5-alpha reduction”. While several studies indeed support the idea that DHT is an influencer for hair-loss and that anabolic steroids all have a certain tendency to interact with 5-alpha reductase, most of the steroids used for bodybuilding and powerlifting are not potent substrates for 5-alpha reductase, if they interact at all. Testosterone is the only anabolic steroid that is converted to DHT via 5-alpha reductase, which is contrary to the common misconception that all other anabolic steroids would also be converted to DHT. Other steroids that are substrates for 5-alpha reductase are converted to unique metabolites with their own individual anabolic and androgenic potency. For example, Boldenone (Equipoise) can be converted to dihydroboldenone (DHB) via 5-alpha reductase. Nandrolone can be converted to dihydronandrolone (DHN) via 5-alpha reductase. The two metabolites DHB and DHN each have their own unique anabolic and androgenic potency and will not be equal to one another, nor will they be equal to DHT. Testosterone vs. Other Anabolic Steroids as a Catalyst for Hair Loss Excessive intake of testosterone can definitely result in an increased susceptibility to hair loss due to its interaction with 5-alpha reductase to produce DHT, as well as via its inherent anabolic activity, albeit to a much lesser extent. Meanwhile, certain synthetic anabolic steroids such as Primobolan are designed to maximize the anabolic activity in the body with a lower incidence of androgenic activity and do not interact with 5-alpha reductase at all.  However, just because a steroid does not interact with 5-alpha reductase that does not mean that the parent hormone is hair safe whatsoever. There are several other steroids that do not interact with 5-alpha reductase that will still cause hair loss. The overarching concept that needs to be remembered is that all steroids have their own individual level of anabolism and androgenicity in tissues. Regardless if a steroid is a 5-alpha reduced metabolite, or a parent hormone, they are all still steroids at the end of the day with their own anabolic and androgenic impact on affected tissues in the body, and they need to all be accounted for. Anabolic Steroid Interaction With 5-Alpha Reductase Finasteride is essentially a downstream androgen synthesis inhibitor. This particular medication reduces the formation of the potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), from its precursor testosterone by successfully inhibiting the 5-alpha reductase enzyme. Since DHT is several times more androgenic than testosterone, this would significantly decrease the amount of androgenic influence on the body. An important aspect to take into consideration is that the parent hormones themselves are inherently androgenic to a significant extent. In fact, with some steroids, the metabolites could be far less androgenic than the parent hormone, in which case 5-alpha reduction could actually be more hair loss sparing.  Nandrolone is an example of this, where the parent hormone (nandrolone) is more androgenic than its metabolite produced via 5-alpha reduction (DHN); subsequently making concurrent Finasteride use an accelerant of androgenic alopecia. Finasteride Only Prevents DHT Derived Hair Loss To sum up, Finasteride may meaningfully prevent hair loss only if the cause is due to excess DHT. This is because DHT is more several times more androgenic than testosterone. DHT exhibits such poor anabolic tissue selectivity that it is one of the few steroids that actually features an androgenic rating several times higher than its anabolic rating. In short, DHT sucks at building muscle. In a study conducted to determine whether the intake of Dutasteride would affect muscle mass accrual, those treated with the medication had similar results to the untreated control group; meaning that the decreased DHT level had no significant anabolic impact on muscle growth.  Even by nearly wiping out the participants' DHT levels with Dutasteride, they did not experience hindered muscle growth at all in response to graded testosterone doses [R]. In fact, an argument can be made that inhibiting 5-alpha reductase can mediate supraphysiological muscle growth due to a higher ratio of testosterone to DHT. This is apparent in pseudohermaphrodites who are inherently 5-alpha reductase-deficient due to genetic mutations [R]. In this particular study involving brothers with different DHT levels, the male with 5-alpha reductase deficiency experienced reduced sexual development throughout puberty, but also gained more muscle mass than his brother. In the image below, the man on the left has a 5-alpha reductase deficiency, and his brother on the right doesn't have a deficiency. The man on the left has a higher testosterone level, is more muscular, and has less androgenic alopecia than his brother on the right who has normal DHT levels.  The Steroids Finasteride Or Dutasteride Can Protect Your Hair From Finasteride and Dutasteride do not occupy or inhibit androgen receptors, but rather they inhibit the 5-alpha reductase enzyme primarily responsible for converting testosterone to DHT. These medications are extremely effective at reducing DHT levels, hence why natural athletes and those on mild doses of exogenous testosterone typically experience the attenuation of hair loss progression with it, or at least some degree of slow down (dependent on the individual's androgen receptor density, sensitivity, residual DHT levels, free testosterone levels, and a myriad of other less relevant factors). Those who blast Trenbolone, or any other anabolic steroid, will not be protected from the androgenic activity of those hormones on the scalp. It is essential to thoroughly understand the mechanism of action of everything going into your body prior to haphazardly popping pills in attempts to blindly remedy a side effect like hair loss, as you may be wasting your time, or even potentially make the situation worse.

    "content": "Flex Wheeler Myostatin Deficiency | Genetics Study Conducted On Mr. Olympia Bodybuilders     It’s theorized in the bodybuilding community that the reason Flex Wheeler and other top Olympia caliber bodybuilders are able to build such incredible physiques is due to Myostatin deficiency. Other popular theories circulate around that include ideas as vastly different as androgen receptor sensitivity is higher in top bodybuilders, to the complete opposite side of the spectrum where some believe that training past a certain pain threshold is what separates champions from the rest and that genetics are just a small factor in determining bodybuilding success. In this article I delve into Myostatin gene mutations, claims about top Mr. Olympia bodybuilders' DNA, and outline what kind of potential impact Myostatin has shown to have in the clinical data. In addition, I take a deep dive into the actual study conducted on Flex Wheeler and a handful of other Mr. Olympia contenders and show what was revealed about their DNA, as well as how it compared to average individuals.

The MSTN gene is a gene that makes instructions for producing the protein myostatin. Myostatin regulates skeletal muscle growth by restraining it when necessary. In turn, it prevents the body from gaining too much muscle. Current research that surrounds myostatin is based around its treatment for musculoskeletal degenerative diseases. Coincidentally, animals that have mutations in the encoding gene MSTN show greater muscle mass, strength, and in some circumstances reduced body fat as well. Examples of Myostatin deficiencies are found in lab based rodent models, as well as in the farming industry with myostatin deficient cattle. Myostatin Knockout Mice Mice that lack the gene that creates myostatin have approximately twice as much muscle mass as normal mice [R]. Myostatin inhibitors have been proposed by many to be the most promising new area of science in a bodybuilding context, as well as potentially better alternative treatment for muscle wasting diseases.  Belgian Blue Double-Muscled Cattle The Belgian Blue has a myostatin gene mutation, consequently preventing its feedback loop of muscle growth inhibition from working correctly. This mutation interferes with fat deposition and can lead to accelerated lean muscle growth. The acceleration of muscle growth in Belgian Blues is due primarily to physiological changes in the animal's muscle cells (fibers) from hypertrophy to a hyperplasia mode of growth. This growth occurs in the fetus and results in a calf being born with two times the number of muscle fibers as a calf without a myostatin gene mutation [R].  Myostatin Elevates In Response To Androgens While there are likely other counterregulatory mechanisms in the body that inhibit excessive muscle growth, the main factor appears to be myostatin elevation. Myostatin increases to prevent you from gaining unhealthy amounts of muscle. In the following study, the effects of exogenous testosterone and trenbolone on myostatin levels was evaluated [R]. This study showed that after 29 days of administration of either testosterone or trenbolone, myostatin protein levels were 197% higher in the castrated and testosterone group, and 209% higher in the castrated and trenbolone group when compared to the placebo.  There's a reason why this mechanism is in place in our bodies and we can't grow linearly. Too much of anything is not going to be good, and when you try to push your body to a place that isn't healthy, homeostatic mechanisms in the body will try to stop you. The human body is a big balancing act. More Androgens = More Myostatin = More Muscle Growth Inhibition As previously outlined, myostatin is a growth inhibitor that elevates in the presence of androgens. Based on the current research it appears that the higher your dose of exogenous anabolics, the greater muscle growth potential you have, and consequently the higher your myostatin will elevate in parallel to inhibit absurd rates of muscle growth. In a study evaluating the effect graded doses of testosterone have on myostatin levels in young and older men, myostatin levels were significantly higher on day 56 than baseline in both groups [R]. The myostatin hypothesis isn't air tight and has some holes in the data contradicting its muscle growth inhibiting effects. However, based on what we know to date, the research suggests that its more than likely the main regulatory mechanism involved in muscle growth response relative to androgen receptor activation. Myostatin is well known to negatively regulate muscle mass in mice, cattle, dogs and humans [R]. Myostatin Is Elevated In HIV Positive Individuals Myostatin is detectable in human skeletal muscle, and its expression is increased in the muscles of HIV-infected men with muscle wasting compared to that in normal men [R].  Does this mean that the muscle wasting that occurs with disease is caused in part by myostatin elevation? Maybe, and the relationship between the two is definitely notable. Studies Measuring How Much Myostatin Gene Mutations Can Affect Bodybuilding Progress A small study was conducted to discover if the mutations in the SNP rs1805086 have any impact on the male bodybuilding population from a muscle hypertrophy and muscle performance standpoint [R]. The secondary aim was to speculate if rare mutations are more prevalent in those who decide to choose a sport such as bodybuilding, as research indicates that mutations in MSTN can illicit larger muscle mass gains and a reduction in body fat. The Lys(K)153Arg(R) polymorphism in exon 2 (rs1805086, 2379 A>G replacement) of the myostatin (MSTN) gene is a candidate to influence skeletal muscle phenotypes and is listed on SNPedia as the top risk genotype for causing myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy [R, R]. 17% of the subject group had one mutation (AG), 83% had the common outcome (AA) and 0% (0) had two mutations (GG). Those with the AG genotype had an average arm circumference of 46.37 cm compared with AA which had an average of 42.02 cm. Those with the AG genotype had an average pull-up max score of 21 compared with AA with an average of 12. Those with the AG genotype had an average push-up max of 61 compared with AA with an average of 40. The study clearly shows that those with a mutation are rare, however the mutation does appear to give the subject a performance and size advantage over those with the common outcome.  Another study had similar findings when evaluating A55T and K153R polymorphisms [R]. Our results indicated that individuals with AT + TT genotype of the A55T polymorphism showed a significant increase in the thickness of biceps (0.292 ± 0.210 cm, P = 0.03), but not quadriceps (0.254 ± 0.198 cm, P = 0.07), compared to carriers of AA genotype. For the K153R polymorphism, the increases in the thicknesses of both biceps (0.300 ± 0.131 cm) and quadriceps (0.421 ± 0.281 cm) were significantly higher among individuals with KR than those with KK genotypes (P < 0.01 for both muscles). The results obtained therefore suggested a possible association between the two polymorphisms and the strength training-induced muscle hypertrophy among men of Han Chinese ethnicity. The K153R polymorphism is the same Lys(K)153Arg(R) polymorphism in exon 2 (rs1805086, 2379 A>G replacement) of the myostatin (MSTN) gene evaluated in the first study mentioned. SNPs Found To Influence Myostatin-Related Muscle Hypertrophy According to SNPedia, these 3 SNPs definitely relate to myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy:     Max Magnitude Chromosome position Summary RiskGeno NormalGeno     rs1805086 0 190,060,351  Rs1805086(G;G)    rs35781413 0 190,060,319  Rs35781413(A;A)    rs3791782 0 190,055,926  Rs3791782(C;C)      The rs1805086 SNP in particular is the one most commonly looked at in relation to bodybuilding outcomes. It is often referred to during discussions of the “bodybuilder gene”. The rs1805086 SNP genotype AA is seen as the commonly occurring one, with the risk alleles being the rs1805086 GG genotype. The disease literally listed as a potential outcome of having this risk genotype is myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy.  Just having one G allele is rare to begin with, and being homozygous for it is very rare. In my first video, I was basing my conclusion of Flex Wheeler's genetic significance solely off the extrapolation of Victor Conte's broad statement in his letter.  I assumed that Flex probably had the rarest GG genotype for the rs1805086 SNP. However, after digging into the study conducted on Flex Wheeler itself, we are led to what is likely a much different conclusion, and is what I will delve into next. Flex Wheeler Myostatin Deficiency Supposedly, Flex Wheeler was a participant in a study conducted in collaboration with the department of human genetics at the university of Pittsburgh involving 62 men. During this study, Flex was purportedly found to have a very rare myostatin mutation at the exon 2 position on the gene. In theory, this supposed gene mutation prevented his body from producing normal amounts of myostatin, consequently resulting in a much larger number of muscle fibers than the average male.

DNA of a CHAMPION! ??‍♂️? – Full video to be uploaded to my YouTube Account very soon, stay tuned! – #bodybuildingmotivation #fitness #thelegend #gainz #sultanofsymmetry #aesthetic #flex #ironman A post shared by  IFBB LEGEND FLEX WHEELER (@officialflexwheeler) on Jun 24, 2018 at 3:50pm PDT   \n\n Animals and humans with inhibited myostatin levels have consistently shown to have much greater levels of musculature relative to their non-inhibited counterparts, and based on this it isn't crazy to assume that genetic freaks in bodybuilding developed their physiques as a result of a similar gene mutation. In theory, someone with low myostatin levels could continue to progress at rates that would be impossible for someone with normal myostatin levels. The end result of chronically low myostatin levels could potentially be substantially greater levels of muscle gain from the exact same diet, training and drugs. Victor Conte's Letter About Flex Wheeler Victor Conte is one of the individuals associated with the myostatin mutation study conducted on Flex Wheeler and an assortment of other IFBB pro bodybuilders. 99% of those in the bodybuilding community who discuss Flex's myostatin deficiency are referencing a letter written in October, 1998 by Victor Conte. Whether this letter is legitimate and unaltered is unclear, but for what it is worth, we will assume it is legit as it is what has circulated around our community for years. October 1, 1998 Re: Flex Wheeler To whom it may concern: I am writing this letter per the request of Flex Wheeler. I would first like to briefly provide you with some background information regarding BALCO Laboratories. BALCO has been working with elite Olympic and professional athletes for over fifteen years. BALCO has provided testing and consultation for over 250 NFL players including the entire 1998 Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos team and the entire Miami Dolphins team. BALCO works with professional athletes in many sports including tennis (Michael Chang, Jim Courier, etc.), hockey, bodybuilding (10 of the 16 1998 Mr. Olympia contestants), track and field, soccer and basketball (Seattle SuperSonics). BALCO Laboratories has been testing and monitoring Flex on a routine basis during the last year. We have performed tests including blood chemistry (SMAC), complete blood count (CBC), PSA, anabolic hormone levels, genotyping as well as comprehensive testing for nutritional elements. Flex's test results have been compared to twenty-four other professional bodybuilders and overall he has one of the healthiest profiles. Basically, Flex is in excellent health and has demonstrated the discipline necessary to maintain a peak level of conditioning. Flex was a participant in a study we recently conducted in collaboration with the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh involving 62 men who made unusually large gains in muscle mass in response to strength training (extreme responders). Flex was one of only nine extreme responders that had the very rare “myostatin mutation.” Myostatin is the gene that “limits muscle growth.” Specifically, Flex had the rarest form of myostatin mutation at the “exon 2” position on the gene. This simply means Flex has a much larger number of muscle fibers compared to the other subjects or the normal population. We believe that these are the very first myostatin mutation findings in humans and the results of this landmark study have already been submitted for publication. Flex was also found to have a very unusual type of the IGF-1 gene. In fact, Flex was the only participant in the study that did not have a “match.” All of the other extreme responders had at least three other subjects with a matching IGF-1 gene. Based upon Flex's very unique genetic profile, we plan to expeditiously publish a scientific paper that reveals his complete genotype in specific detail. The publication of his remarkable genetic data should generate an enormous amount of media exposure. Hope this information will be helpful and please call if I can be of assistance. Sincerely, /s/ Victor Conte Victor Conte President BALCO Laboratories, Inc. The Myostatin Mutation Study Conducted On Flex Wheeler And Other IFBB Pros This study is commonly referenced but I have yet to see someone actually dig it up and cross reference the data in it with the statements made in Victor Conte's letter. I did some digging and found it. The study is called “frequent sequence variation in the human myostatin (GDF8) gene as a marker for analysis of muscle-related phenotypes” [R]. Based on what Victor stated in his letter, there were nine extreme responders with a very rare myostatin mutation. Supposedly Flex Wheeler had the rarest mutation of all at the exon 2 position on the gene, making him unique from all other individuals in the study.  Subjects In The Study Sequencing of selected regions of the myostatin gene and genotyping of common variants were carried out in a comparison sample of 96 randomly selected Caucasian and 96 African American subjects from the general population. An additional 72 individuals were screened for a common exon 2 variant. One hundred fifty-three subjects, including 127 men (32 African American, 91 Caucasian, and 4 Asian) and 26 women (9 African American, 16 Caucasian, and 1 Asian), were categorized by the magnitude of increases in muscle mass they experienced from strength training. The subjects consisted of:  18 world-class bodybuilders (ranked in the top 100 worldwide)  25 competitive bodybuilders not ranked in the top 100 7 elite power lifters 9 university football players 55 previously untrained subjects who had their quadricep muscle volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging before and after 9 weeks of heavy resistance strength training of the knee extensors 61 nonathletes, who were questioned about their ability to increase their muscle mass in response to intense and prolonged strength training  5 of the 18 world-class bodybuilders were Mr. Olympia contenders ranked in the top 10 worldwide.  https://youtu.be/UupRWgrJ96A A rating of 5 was given to those who were world-class bodybuilders and to those who increased their quadriceps muscle mass by more than 400 cm³ after only 9 weeks of strength training, whereas a rating of 0 was given to those who experienced no noticeable increase in muscle mass after vigorous strength training for at least 6 months. Eighteen subjects received a rating of 5, and 13 subjects received a rating of 0. The ratings of the remaining subjects fell somewhere between these two extremes. 62 subjects who were rated as either 4 or 5 were classified as extreme responders, and were compared to 48 subjects who were rated as either 0 or 1 and were classified as nonresponders. Subjects were also grouped and compared by race. Information on muscle mass changes with strength training from the remaining subjects was obtained through either estimates of fat-free mass assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or hydrodensitometry or in the case of competitive bodybuilders, power lifters, football players, and nonathletes, through questionnaire data on prior success in bodybuilding competition and/or reported changes in muscle mass with strength training. Study Results Without boring you with the less relevant details in the study, the most notable part is the conclusion. The lack of a significant relationship between myostatin genotypes and overall muscle mass response to strength training suggests that response is not significantly influenced by variation at the myostatin locus. However, it is interesting to note that three of the African American nonresponders were homozygous for the less common (Arg) allele at the exon 2 K153R site, while none of the responders were homozygous for this allele. Three of the five mutations causing the double muscle phenotype in cattle occur in exon 2 and are recessive, but two are chain termination mutations and one is a deletion, expected to produce a nonfunctional myostatin protein. Whether variation in the myostatin gene influences muscle phenotypes other than the muscle mass increase in response to strength training requires further exploration. The less common Arg allele that is being referred to in the study conclusion is the mutation that you would expect Flex Wheeler to have. But, it doesn't appear that he has it. Sandwiched in the middle of the study is a mention of what may be highlighting the true root of Flex's genetic superiority. Among the six nucleotide changes, two, P198A and the intron 2 A/G, were observed in a single individual and two, I225T and E164K, were observed in two individuals, always heterozygous with the wildtype allele. The remaining two were present in the general population as common polymorphisms. The (A55T) and (K153R) variants are common in both ethnic groups, with the less frequent allele having a three to four times higher frequency in African Americans. These variable sites have the potential to alter the function of the myostatin gene product and could alter nutrient partitioning in individuals heterozygous or homozygous for the variant allele. What we can presume Flex Wheeler has is two nucleotide changes, P198A and the intron 2 A/G.  That is the only note in the entire publication that distinguishes one individual in the study from the rest. What we can presume to be the nucleotide changes Flex Wheeler has aren't even mentioned on SNPedia's list of related risk genotypes. The only vague reference we have to it is in a study that examined the association between the MSTN exonic variants and ‘explosive’ leg power in 214 male university students [R]. And in that study the only thing mentioned is that no subjects in the study had the MSTN exonic variant P198A. It appears that despite the uncommon (Arg) allele at the exon 2 K153R site being the main focus of most Myostatin papers and being honed in on as the root of the “bodybuilder gene”, it does not seem to have as significant of an impact on muscle growth response to training as many thought at the end of the day. The lack of a significant relationship between myostatin genotypes and overall muscle mass is very notable as this study included 5 Mr. Olympia caliber bodybuilders, and several other top tier IFBB pros. The most interesting thing to note is that three of the African American nonresponders were homozygous for the less common (Arg) allele at the exon 2 K153R site, while none of the responders were homozygous for this allele. Of the identified GDF8 variations in humans, the Lys(K)153Arg(R) polymorphism in exon 2 (rs1805086, 2379 A>G replacement) of the myostatin (MSTN) gene is a candidate to influence skeletal muscle phenotypes [R]. None of the extreme responder bodybuilders were homozygous for this allele though. I had mentioned in the first video that having the AG genotype in general is rare. It was found to have a significant impact on muscle size and muscle strength in the study I outlined earlier in the article. Logically, you would assume that the GG genotype (which is even more uncommon), would result in a lack of myostatin and some insane level of muscle growth. That doesn't seem to be the case though based on this study. 3 of the subjects who had a poor response to training and subpar muscle growth (nonresponders) were the ones who had this rare genotype. Only three individuals had extremely rare nucleotide changes. This includes who I assume to be Flex who has two nucleotide changes, P198A and the intron 2 A/G, and two other individuals having I225T and E164K nucleotide changes, all of which were heterozygous with the wildtype allele. That leaves 2 top tier Mr. Olympia caliber bodybuilders, several other world class IFBB pro bodybuilders, and a lot of other elite athletes, with MSTN genotypes that have shown to have minimal impact on muscle growth response to training in this study. The two other nucleotide changes causing the double muscle phenotype in cattle are the A55T and K153R variants and are present in the general population as common polymorphisms. These variable sites have shown potential to alter the function of the myostatin gene product and could alter nutrient partitioning in individuals heterozygous or homozygous for the variant allele. However, the data in this study shows that there is not a significant relationship between myostatin genotypes and overall muscle mass response to strength training. Inconsistencies In The Clinical Data And Victor Conte Letter I don't know where the statements in the letter Victor wrote are coming from. He claims that Flex Wheeler had the rarest form of myostatin mutation at the exon 2 position on the gene. But when we look at the study itself, it says 3 of the non-responders were homozygous. None of the responders were homozygous. Flex Wheeler would have undoubtedly been categorized as an extreme responder, and yet, he was not one of the individuals with the GDF8 variation in humans we would expect to see in a myostatin deficient individual. Based on this, we can presume he is the individual mentioned in the study with two nucleotide changes, P198A and the intron 2 A/G. Victor also mentioned how “nine extreme responders had the very rare myostatin mutation.” We can see in the data that only three individuals had uncommon nucleotide changes, not nine, and the rest of the subjects had common polymorphisms present in the general population. In addition, of the mutations mentioned, even if more of the top caliber bodybuilders had notable mutations, the study conclusion still states that there is not a significant relationship between myostatin genotypes and overall muscle mass response to strength training. Victor also stated in his letter that Flex is one of the healthiest of his professional bodybuilders he's been monitoring, and that Flex is in excellent health. We have performed tests including blood chemistry (SMAC), complete blood count (CBC), PSA, anabolic hormone levels, genotyping as well as comprehensive testing for nutritional elements. Flex's test results have been compared to twenty-four other professional bodybuilders and overall he has one of the healthiest profiles. Basically, Flex is in excellent health and has demonstrated the discipline necessary to maintain a peak level of conditioning. This was written on October 1, 1998. If you know the history of Flex Wheeler, you'll know that he ended up having to stop competing after discovering in 1999 that he had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (a form of kidney disease), and then retired shortly thereafter. I don't know how something that massive could be overlooked to that extent. It makes me question the legitimacy of this letter in the first place. If Flex was truly on the brink of kidney failure, I don't see how it was determined that he was one of the healthiest bodybuilders being supervised by Victor, and how this extensive testing didn't pick this up. The first thing that comes to my mind is curiosity around whether or not there was some sort of money-making endeavor associated with this. The supplement industry was crazy in the 90's. Steroids were sold legally over the counter, and you could make ridiculous false claims about pretty much whatever you want and then sell products based on that. The false claims are still around today, but now we have the resources at our fingertips to actually see through the garbage being marketed to us, whereas in the 90's nobody knew better and a myostatin inhibiting supplement that can make you as jacked as Flex Wheeler likely would have sold like crazy. Maybe this guess is way off of what the real intention was, but I don't see what could have been the motivation behind this letter, or what it was seeking to accomplish. It is entirely possible that they were thinking of teaming up to create some sort of myostatin inhibitor supplement that would be based on Flex's unique genotype. Conclusion I don't know if the further publication that Victor mentioned in the letter ever came to surface. Based upon Flex's very unique genetic profile, we plan to expeditiously publish a scientific paper that reveals his complete genotype in specific detail. The publication of his remarkable genetic data should generate an enormous amount of media exposure. I'm assuming that this was probably put on the back burner after Flex had his health issues in 1999. I don't know what the goal of this letter was, and there are several inconsistencies between it and the actual study that would need further clarification to make any conclusive statements. Who was this letter addressed to and why was Flex Wheeler requesting this letter be written in the first place? Aside from the mystery of this letter that greatly interests me, it seems like we can at least conclude based on the study findings that most myostatin gene mutations do not appear to be the differentiating factor between top Mr. Olympia caliber extreme responders and the average joe.

    "content": "How Much Do Natural Testosterone Levels Decrease Per Year As You Get Older?     Many health authorities state that natural Testosterone levels decrease by 1% per year. This figure is incorrect, and is not based on bioavailable Testosterone.  Once men enter their 30's and start to get closer to being middle-aged, their endogenous Testosterone production starts to steadily decline. This is well understood, but how accurate is the 1% per year figure commonly thrown around? In general, not very accurate when all things are considered. On the surface, total testosterone levels decline by 0.8 to 1.6 percent on average in men over the age of 40 [R]. But, that's not the value that actually matters. Most will look at total testosterone levels as a way to measure adequate hormone levels. The fact is, you could have a 900 ng/dL total testosterone level and still experience low testosterone symptoms if you don't have an optimal SHBG and free testosterone level. At the end of the day, free testosterone levels will show you exactly how much testosterone is actually available to be used in tissues. If you have high testosterone production, but more of it is being bound up by SHBG and albumin than should be, it won't matter what your total testosterone level is on paper. If you have a sky high total testosterone level, but a very low free testosterone level, you will not have enough usable testosterone available to tissues to support optimal function. With that in mind, we have to also consider the fact that sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels increase by 1.6% per year [R]. Not only do natural testosterone levels decrease, but we also have a concurrent increase in the main protein in the body responsible for binding up usable testosterone and preventing it from transcribing its effects in tissues. As you would expect taking both factors into consideration, free testosterone levels in the body decline even more substantially. With total testosterone levels decreasing, there is less testosterone in the body, and with an increase in SHBG, even more of that further declining testosterone gets rendered unusable. Because of this, bioavailable testosterone levels decrease by 2 to 3 percent per year on average. 2 to 3 percent of your usable testosterone per year is substantial, and expectedly will often eventually lead to significant detriment to quality of life. Now, how is this random statistic useful to real world application? Well, armed with this knowledge you can more accurately interpret blood work, and I will detail exactly what tests you need to get done to actually assess your hormone profile. Most doctors are quick to send you packing if your total testosterone levels are in range, even if you still have chronic low testosterone symptoms. First of all, most doctors have no idea what the difference between total and free testosterone levels are, and secondly, most of the doctors who know what the difference is still have no idea how to order accurate high sensitivity hormone testing. On paper you could have a total testosterone level of 800 ng/dL but still experience horrendous low testosterone symptoms if free testosterone, estradiol and SHBG aren't being tested properly. Most of the time, a doctor will write you a requisition to get your hormones assessed via a primitive methodology known as electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). This is an outdated assay that is not accurate, especially if you use exogenous hormones. It is not uncommon to have a critical hormone incorrectly show as “healthy” in the middle of the reference range when high sensitivity testing would reveal that you are actually severely deficient. I have verified this now several times myself with both Estrogen testing and Testosterone testing. At minimum, these are the exact tests you should be getting to assess your hormone profile:  Total Testosterone determined using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) Free Testosterone determined using Equilibrium Dialysis or Equilibrium Ultrafiltration Estradiol determined using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) Sex Hormone binding Globulin, Serum (SHBG)  DHT, DHEA and Pregnenolone would be useful to have too, but the tests above are the main ones that will ultimately determine if you are functioning at a high level or not. To simplify things, this is the comprehensive blood test I recommend that you get to assess your health as a whole: Male Athletic Anti-Aging Panel It is the best overall panel offered for men in all regards for health status evaluation, but the garbage Testosterone testing using direct analog enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and ECLIA is what is included in the panel. You will need to add Testosterone, Free, Equilibrium Ultrafiltration With Total Testosterone, LC/MS-MS separately to your cart as the comprehensive panel I recommend only comes with sensitive assay Estradiol testing.

    "content": "Testosterone Dosage For Bodybuilding | The Highest Dose Of Testosterone I Would Use     In this article I detail what I wish somebody taught me before I started using anabolics about the ideal testosterone dosage to use during a bulking phase. When I first got into bodybuilding, I started researching bodybuilding pharmacology like a maniac. I was on the forums daily, I would rack the brains of guys I considered veterans in the community, I would listen to gurus, and I would scour the internet for anything I could find. For the last decade I've been absorbing information, and filtering out the crap. As you've probably experienced first hand, there is A LOT of garbage that circulates in this community. Unfortunately, when I first started researching there weren't nearly as many credible sources of information in the community. The logical conclusion you make as a newbie is that the guy who is older and bigger than you probably knows more than you, so you should probably take what they say as solid advice. I did this a lot, and I also took a lot of theories to heart that weren't backed with any science. With that being said, personal experience is still very important. A research paper can only tell you so many things about X compound before you need to just try it for yourself to really have valuable insight on its potential benefits and drawbacks in a bodybuilding context. My personal experience and research has led me to many conclusions that I wouldn't have been able to wrap my head around even a few years ago, let alone when I first started learning about this stuff.

I had heard for years that Testosterone needs to be a base for every single steroid cycle. No matter what, you needed to have Testosterone in there. Logically, this makes sense on the surface. We naturally produce Testosterone, so if you shut down your hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) with exogenous steroids then you would need to replace your Testosterone production with exogenous Testosterone. That was as far as anyone would explain the point of a Test base though, and for several years I accepted that as best practice. At a higher level, despite the fact that a Test base is still something that will be beneficial for the vast majority of AAS users, it is important to understand why you are injecting a steroid to begin with. Why exactly is an oral-only cycle a poor choice at a higher level than your gym bro telling you “if you don't use Test you will get f*cked up!” Well, the main reason you need Testosterone is not just to activate androgen receptors and transcribe anabolic and androgenic effects in tissues in the body, but also it is to aromatize into a sufficient amount of Estrogen to fulfill a myriad of other physiological functions. Only in recent years has the importance of adequate Estrogen levels been highlighted even by experts in the community, and the previous dogma in the community up until the last few years was that Estrogen is bad and you should use an Aromatase Inhibitor to lower Estrogen to the middle of the reference range no matter what. Little consideration was given for the androgen to Estrogen ratio in the body, the fat loss and growth factor inhibiting effect unnecessarily lowering Estrogen can have, or the massive impact Estrogen has on lipid modulation. The clinical data also suggests how neuroprotective and cardioprotective Testosterone is relative to other anabolic steroids, but often fails to acknowledge that this effect may not be mediated by Testosterone at all, rather, it is the Estrogen that is created as a result of aromatization in the body. Give a man a bunch of any drug that suppresses Testosterone production to nearly zero and you will see a subsequent spike in neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. Creating a therapeutic amount of Estradiol in your body is mediated through Testosterone aromatizing into Estrogen. While there are synthetic steroids that have proven to act on Estrogen receptors, or aromatize into Estrogen themselves, they have inherent flaws that cannot match the bioidentical androgen our body modulates in all aspects with far greater ease.  Dianabol aromatizes into 17α-methylestradiol and is inherently hepatotoxic. Equipoise (Boldenone) is a poor substrate for aromatase and is incredibly kidney toxic relative to Testosterone. Trestolone aromatizes into 7α-methylestradiol and could potentially become a viable “test base” alternative, but for the time being, its therapeutic efficacy in this context still lags behind the obvious go to which is bioidentical Testosterone. Nandrolone is a very poor substrate for aromatase and will not maintain healthy levels of Estradiol relative to the androgen load exerted on the body, even at high dosages.  While certain steroids can activate Estrogen receptors or aromatize into Estrogens themselves, none fit the bill for a perfect balancing act in all aspects like bioidentical Testosterone does. The 3 Categories Of Steroids The anabolic steroids we use for bodybuilding more or less break down into 3 different categories that you should understand thoroughly. Testosterone (and its derivatives), DHT Derivatives, and 19-Nor's.  Testosterone And Its Derivatives The main steroids we concern ourselves with in this category include Testosterone, Dianabol and Equipoise. Aside from Trestolone, these are the only notable steroids that provide enough Estrogenic activity to function as “bases” of a cycle. DHT Derivatives The main steroids we concern ourselves with in this category include Masteron, Proviron, Winstrol, Primobolan, Anavar, Anadrol and Superdrol. DHT derivatives are not substrates for aromatase and thus have minimal estrogenic activity (with the exception of Anadrol).  19-Nortestosterone (Nandrolone) Derivatives The main steroids we concern ourselves with in this category include Nandrolone, Trenbolone and Trestolone (MENT). The Point Of Stacking Other Anabolics With Testosterone The main purpose of the Testosterone base is to maintain a physiologic amount of Estrogen that you would otherwise lose when your endocrine system is shut down in the presence of exogenous androgens. Once this function is fulfilled and you have that therapeutic level of Estradiol (E2) fulfilled via a base of Testosterone, what are you doing above and beyond that that's helping you in a bodybuilding context? When I was first getting into my research I would commonly see 500 mg of Testosterone per week being deemed a “newbie cycle” dosage, and a Test base during a cycle was no less than 500 mg per week in every single cycle thereafter when stacked alongside other compounds. The dosage of Testosterone proposed in the “ideal” newbie cycle is so high that you already have guys on their first cycle forced to use Aromatase Inhibitors to prevent Estrogenic side effects. In general, if you need to use an aromatase inhibitor to use a certain dosage of Testosterone, I would deem that dosage of Testosterone too high for you. Testosterone is a great muscle building hormone, but oftentimes there are better ways to get the job done with lower overall stress on the body. Remember, Testosterone is one of the most primitive steroids there is. All steroids developed after Testosterone were synthesized in attempts to make a more tissue selective hormone than Testosterone in order to be used in a clinical setting with higher levels of tolerability. Tolerability, virilization, and health/biomarker impact are three very different metrics to assess the overall safety profile of a compound. The ideal anabolic agent would induce a significant amount of anabolic activity, with a relative lack of impact on biomarkers and masculinization. This is easier said than done though. This is what drove chemists to continue synthesizing new steroids after discovering Testosterone. You can't inject a woman with a bunch of Testosterone to prevent muscle wasting without inducing severe virilizing side effects. Expectedly, more tissue selective alternatives that can induce the same anabolic activity with less side effects are more ideal in a therapeutic setting. This is also why the development of SARMs is very promising. This is where compounds like Primobolan, Anavar and Nandrolone showed such therapeutic promise too. With that being said, anabolic/androgenic ratios aren't the end all be all that we should base our compound choices on, and oftentimes they are completely incorrect (e.g. with Winstrol). When To Stack Other Steroids With Testosterone Taking this all into consideration, if muscle growth with a minimization of negative health impact is the goal, this is what I would suggest. After ensuring you have a physiologic amount of testosterone as your base at minimum, would it be wiser to increase your Testosterone dosage into the stratosphere and force yourself to introduce adjunct ancillary drugs to continue breaking plateaus, or introduce anabolic steroids that complement your base. Well, that depends on your genetic propensity to aromatization among numerous factors, but in general, I would say that the most intelligent approach to creating a steroid cycle should be increasing Testosterone as much as you can get away with until the need for an aromatase inhibitor presents itself. Obviously I'm not suggesting you do this on a first cycle, or perhaps even a second or third cycle, but I'm trying to lay out a framework to determine when/if it is justified for you to start stacking on top of your base. As long as Testosterone dosages are slowly tapered upwards as you gain muscle mass, side effects can be kept to a minimum with greater ease than most other compounds. The exception to this are androgenic side effects, but for the sake of this article being focused on bodybuilding outcomes and health, I will be disregarding hair loss/androgenic side effects when I lay out this framework. The synergy between Testosterone and more tissue selective alternatives will always give better results on a milligram for milligram basis, but the impact that total milligram amount per week has on your health, and other things you may or may not care about (e.g. your hair) is what you need to take into consideration. Testosterone wins over all other compounds when you factor in everything with exception of androgenic side effects, but there comes a point for the majority of individuals where more Testosterone is just not feasible without forcing the user to introduce an AI. For those who can blast Test into the sky with no side effects, frankly, they'd probably be better off using a slowly titrating dose of Testosterone to continue breaking plateaus with all things considered (finances, bloodwork, long term health ramifications, etc.). But, for those who are very prone to estrogenic side effects, stacking will be necessary if your goals in muscle accrual exceed what you can accomplish with a moderate dosage of Testosterone.  Testosterone will produce dose-dependent increases in muscle mass. We already know this. However, once you hit a certain dose (individual dependent), you will be forced to introduce adjunct drugs just to mitigate side effects, which will also impair other important biomarkers and hinder muscle growth. This dosage is typically around the 300-400 mg Testosterone per week mark for many individuals. If you don't need an AI though and your body is extremely efficient at balancing androgens relative to estrogens, then by all means, push the Testosterone higher instead without stacking if your biomarkers indicate that it is the healthier choice for you. Testosterone has proven time and time again to be the most forgiving steroid on health markers and it is more than sufficient to grow a physique to IFBB pro standards. Pharmaceutical grade Testosterone is also relatively easy to find for a fair price, whereas pharmaceutical grade Primobolan, Anavar, Nandrolone and Anadrol are commonly faked, or very expensive. How To Know What Compounds To Choose In Your Stack Once you get to a point where you're forced to use an AI just to use a higher dose of Testosterone, was it a wise choice to use that much Testosterone in the first place? Personally, I believe that is where introducing a DHT derivative would then be justified rather than increasing your Testosterone dosage even higher. The DHT derivative will accomplish the following:  Exhibits inherent anabolic effects itself and are typically well tolerated (several DHT derivatives are decent muscle builders). Some can bind with SHBG, consequently freeing up more Testosterone to be used in tissues. Thus making your current dose of Testosterone work “better”. Some can antagonize Estrogen, consequently reducing your need for an AI. This may even give you more wiggle room to increase your Testosterone dose even higher without needing an AI.  Only once you've plateaued from a cycle comprised of a Test base and a DHT derivative do I believe you should even consider introducing a 19-Nor, as they are the least forgiving on health markers, despite their superior anabolic/androgenic tissue selectivity. All steroids accomplish the same thing at the end of the day more or less, so how they are used in your protocol should be based on your propensity to side effects and individual specific biomarkers. In addition, your tolerance to androgenic activity needs to be factored in, as managing hair loss and other androgenic side effects on hormones is a totally different ballgame than managing side effects in a completely health focused context. While you can get to 260+ pounds lean on a bunch of Testosterone (if you have great genetics), could you have not accomplished the same thing with a much lower androgen load, or without needing to pop AI's like candy to tolerate the dosage of Testosterone needed to support that much lean muscle growth? This is what I wish I learned about sooner, because it wasn't until after I finished trying to chase bodybuilding goals that I feel I really started to understand more optimal practices. Misconceptions Surrounding Certain Compounds Certain compounds that are very effective get completely overlooked because of their relative lack of potency, and oftentimes even their relative lack of side effects. “Wet” compounds like Dbol will give the user an inflated look as a result of its conversion to 17α-methylestradiol. If something bloats you up 10 pounds nearly overnight, does that mean it is a more effective muscle builder than something dry but less dramatic due to its relative lack of side effects? No, I don't think so. Compounds like Primobolan will get overlooked because of this, and they are seen as “girl steroids”. If you're in this for the long haul, long term muscle growth is our goal with the least impact on our health possible. There are very few compounds that edge out Primobolan in this regard, despite yielding what may be perceived to be better increases in size in the short term. The reality is, there are several commonly overlooked compounds with better outcomes than commonly reached for steroids not only in a clinical setting, but in a bodybuilding context as well in the long-term. Comparing someone waterlogged on a Test, Nandrolone and Dbol cycle to someone on a Test, Primobolan and Nandrolone cycle, the guy on Dbol might appear to be making significantly more progress at a much faster rate, but are those outcomes just inflated by the guy being waterlogged? Or are they actually yielding more nitrogen retention and lean muscle accrual with their inclusion of Dbol? The side effect profile of the second cycle would be far more tolerable and still yield nearly identical gains in muscle mass all things considered. Keep this in mind when you're designing your cycles. How I Would Approach A Blast Phase If somebody outlined these concepts to me when I was younger I could have significantly reduced my dosages and avoided so much unnecessary hair loss, cardiovascular stress, oxidative stress, and organ stress in general. My dosages were excessive for my goals was the main issue, which I outline further in my article detailing my first cycle. If I were to design subsequent blast phases for myself now (and hair loss wasn't a concern), it would follow the framework I outlined earlier in the article. Testosterone Dosage I would use a base of 300 mg Testosterone per week split into everyday administrations. My Testosterone dosage would titrate up to as high as my body can tolerate without needing an AI or substantial detriment to my health markers during the subsequent cycle. DHT Derivatives Primobolan In the subsequent cycle I would introduce a DHT derivative like Primobolan if I hit a wall with my titrating Testosterone dosage. By hit a wall, I mean that I am put in a position where I need more AAS, but increasing my Testosterone dosage any further would result in me needing to introduce an AI to prevent significant estrogenic side effects from occurring. So, instead of increasing Testosterone further and using an AI, at that point we can look to the DHT derivative family. The dosage of Primobolan would titrate up as needed based on SHBG and Free Testosterone levels (Primo doesn't bind well to SHBG, but the dosage would still be based on what my limits are with Testosterone titration), estrogenic activity in the body, biomarkers, and my tolerability of 19-Nor's. 19-Nortestosterone (Nandrolone) Derivatives Nandrolone Nandrolone is my choice of 19-Nor that would be introduced several cycles later once my body had plateaued from all of the previous blast phases where I had already peaked my Test base dosage and tried a subsequent cycle of a Test base with Primobolan. Advanced AAS Protocol Framework The foundation of each blast phase after I deem my body had reached an “advanced” stage of AAS use again would likely include Testosterone as my base, Primobolan and Nandrolone. While certain compounds could be considered interchangeable, I see no need to rotate compounds in and out during a mass building phase. The primary growth promoters of that stack are Testosterone and Nandrolone, but the dosages of each would be highly dependent on individual gene expression and health markers (as well as basic things like blood pressure). I've been on therapeutic TRT for years so I would milk this compound progression again if I wanted to experience significant progress without needing to jump straight into an advanced stack. It should take you at least a couple years of cycling before you work your body up to a point where a protocol designed using advanced cycle framework is even necessary to deploy to break muscle building plateaus.

I get messages all the time from guys who have dropped their intake under 2000 calories per day and cannot get any leaner asking me what to do to break their plateau. “Derek, I'm cutting on 1600 calories, I am 12% body fat and I want to get down to 7% body fat, what do I do?” This is the most common mistake I see and it can completely ruin your cut by unnecessarily downregulating your metabolism. In scenarios like this, the root of the problem almost always boils down to someone cutting their calories way too soon, consequently forcing their metabolism to slow down to prevent what the body perceives to be imminent starvation. Once you've slowed your metabolism down to a point that you cannot lose fat even eating less than 2000 calories per day, you have dug yourself into a hole that you will need to climb back out of to reach a sustainable diet model again and restore a healthy metabolism. While there are exceptions to this, the vast majority of men will be very micronutrient deficient and feel starved all day eating less than 2000 calories per day.

Muscle rips through calories at rest. This is why many bodybuilders who aren't trying to gain size can walk around with visible abs year round even while eating McDonalds and other crap every single day. Long term, gaining muscle is what will make each cutting phase far easier, as well as make staying lean with a sustainable daily calorie intake much easier as well. While it does expend some calories, going to the gym, exercising and doing a bunch of cardio is just a small fraction of your daily energy expenditure. What is going to determine your energy expenditure on a day-to-day basis is largely going to be your muscle tissue. The more muscle you have, the faster your metabolism will be. That is why making the most out of your off-season when you aren't even trying to get lean is critical for your upcoming cutting phases several months away.  Priming your metabolism with a well planned off-season is one of the biggest keys when it comes to a successful cut phase. Once it actually comes time to cut, the biggest mistake guys make is cutting their calories too soon. Don't Cut Calories Too Early Far too often guys will cut their calories far too soon, plateau again, and then cut their calories even more. As much as calories in vs calories out gets hammered into your head in the fitness industry, a BMR calculator will not account for metabolic adaptation. Sometimes the issue is that guys have no idea how to count their calories properly and aren't actually in a deficit. However, this often isn't the case among guys who aren't complete newbies to bodybuilding. The issue oftentimes among guys who aren't completely new to this is actually that metabolic adaptation is preventing further fat loss due to poor diet choices. And by poor diet choices I don't mean cheating on your diet. I mean dieting too hard too soon. If you cut your calories too quickly, you will eventually end up eating less than 2000 calories per day, still not have achieved the body composition you wanted to, and be wondering what you did wrong, or even throw dangerous fat burners into your protocol to try and milk more fat loss and rip even more muscle off your frame, consequently impairing your metabolism even more. What A Typical Poorly Executed Cutting Phase Will Look Like This applies even for those on steroids, as the same mistakes are made by naturals and enhanced individuals who have been convinced that calories in vs. calories out and maintenance calorie calculations are all that matter. They will typically start at a 500 calorie deficit and be eating around 2500-2700 calories (general example applicable to most). Fat loss will be great and all will be smooth sailing. After a few weeks, weight loss will stall and they will assume that they have plateaued and need to cut their calories a bit more. They will then drop their calorie intake another 300 calories and get down to 2200-2400 calories. Fat loss starts again, and all seems to be smooth sailing but it is starting to get very difficult to stick to the diet at this point because cravings are starting to heighten severely, and hunger is at an all time high. Fat loss plateaus after another couple weeks and they drop their calorie intake another 200 calories and get down to 2000-2200 calories per day. Fat loss starts again, but cravings consume the mind all day and hunger is nearly uncontrollable at this point. Energy starts to feel much lower and workout quality is starting to suffer greatly. Another couple weeks passes and they're much leaner, but they still aren't where they want to be. They plateau again and then cut their calories to 1800-2000 calories. Fat loss starts again, but at this point they are barely functioning and are still hungry even after eating their biggest meal of the day. Hunger consumes their mind all day, and just getting through a workout is much more difficult. Focus and productivity starts to deteriorate as energy levels are very low, and food is all what matters at this point. They may even cave in and binge eat at this point. After another week or two, weight loss plateaus again, and I get an email asking what to do. As you can imagine, this diet model is not sustainable, and it was very poorly executed. This diet model is what leads to skinny fat physiques and yo-yo dieting. The Common Mistake That Will Ruin Your Cut And Your Metabolism Following the typical diet model I outlined above, before you know it you may end up eating less than 2000 calories per day and plateau before achieving the body composition you wanted to. If you cut your calories way too soon, the problem is that you're forcing your body to adapt and slow down to prevent starving to death. Your body reacts and adapts accordingly based on what you provide it energy-wise. That is the same reason why if you're bulking up and you increase your calories to 3300 calories per day you will gain weight for a couple weeks or so, but you will eventually plateau. Now when you're eating 3300 calories a day, your body is staying the same weight, regardless of the fact that you're in a “calorie surplus” according to BMR calculators and calories in vs. calories out dogma. The reason this happens is because your body adapts and auto-regulates your metabolism to accommodate its new intake of calories. When you're cutting, the exact same thing applies. If you're eating 3000 calories per day consistently and then you cut your calories to 2700 to start your cut, you will lose weight. The root of the issue rears its ugly head when you wake up one day and step on the scale and see that your weight loss has stalled. What do most logically do when they see this? They decrease their calories. Expectedly, fat loss starts again and everything seems fine. Then, you wake up in a week or two and plateau again. What do you do? Cut calories again? That's what most will do. You can see where this goes. Before you know it you're stalled out at a hardly lean, maybe even skinny fat 12-13% body fat physique eating 1600 calories per day and doing cardio every day for an hour. Remember, muscle mass is the main thing that will determine how much fat you lose without even exercising. The goal is to keep as much muscle on your frame as possible. Depriving yourself of nutrients is the most catabolic thing you can do. However, a calorie deficit is needed to lose fat, so exactly what should you do to avoid this negative metabolic adaptation and unsustainable diet model? What To Do When Weight Loss Plateaus If you're in a 300 calorie deficit and the scale shows that you plateaued for one day, that does not mean that your body has already downregulated its metabolism and needs another calorie cut to continue losing fat. Your weight may stay the same for three days in a row and then all of a sudden drop a full pound. That doesn't mean that you suddenly lost 1 pound of fat over a random 24 hour period, but it means that using the scale on a 24 hour basis as a metric of progression does not always reveal everything that is going on behind the scenes in your body. There are tons of factors at play that are temporary that will greatly impact your scale weight on a day-to-day basis. These include but are not limited to fluid retention, electrolyte balance, food sitting in your stomach, a piece of crap literally sitting inside you that you haven't dropped yet, among countless other things that can influence your weight. Just because 24 hours has passed and the scale hasn't moved, it doesn't mean that you've stalled. The issue is that most guys will see their weight stay the same for a couple days, or potentially even increase by a bit and then assume that they need to cut their calories again. More often than not, they could have stuck with that calorie allotment for another week and probably milked more fat loss out of that incremental drop in calories. By cutting calories far too soon and far too aggressively you force your body into a state of preservation. Your body doesn't care about getting shredded, in fact it wants the opposite, and metabolic adaption will slow your weight loss down if you don't know how to manipulate it. If you cut down to 1800 calories way too quickly, what's going to happen? You're going to lose tons of fat at first, but then your body's going to downregulate far quicker than it would have if you had kept your calorie intake higher. Because of this, you miss out on a significant amount of fat loss that you could have milked out of those smaller incremental drops in calories that you should have done had you not been so aggressive with your deficit. You will also lose more muscle, which will also impair your fat loss potential. After a month or two when you plateau, you will be in a position where you can't lose any additional fat eating barely anything as is, and you will have nowhere to go as you've dug yourself into the deepest hole you could be in during a cut. I know guys that are my weight and height that are eating as much as my girl to get lean. My girl is 90 pounds! There are guys at 200+ pounds trying to get down to 7% body fat plateauing in fat loss at 12% body fat eating as much as a girl. They can't get any leaner because they've cut their calories down to something ridiculous like 1500, and end up doing cardio for an hour per day, on hordes of fat burners, and still can't get as lean as they want. They dropped from 3000 down to 1500 calories in a matter of weeks as opposed to milking all the fat loss they could have out of each increment. My general approach to cutting and how I advise you do it is to start with a minor deficit. Much like how you would approach a lean bulk (but the opposite). How To Manipulate Your Body's Metabolic Adaptation So You Never Need To Eat Less Than 2000 Calories Per Day Start with minor deficit of 300 calories. That is enough to start the fat loss process.  Milk all the fat loss you can out of it, and then once you plateau for a full week you can then assess what the most intelligent strategy to deploy at that time would be for your goals to continue the fat loss process.  Metabolic adaptation doesn't happen overnight. There's an adjustment period. But, once your body has adapted, you can be damn sure that you're probably going to need to restrict more calories or increase energy expenditure to continue burning fat. What I'm trying to hammer home here is that you don't want to do that too early. Basically, you want to yield the most benefit you can out of each deprivation increment. Once you ensure that your body has actually plateaued, then you cut calories further (or increase your energy expenditure). That next cut shouldn't be an extra 300 calories either. You can start the fat loss process again just by dropping another 100 calories of carbs per day. You don't need to cut 300 calories every single increment to start fat loss again. This is what many do though, and this is why they will end up eating less than 2000 calories per day and still be stalling and spin their wheels for weeks eating like a bird. Guys that know how to diet will NEVER tank their calories from 3000 to 1500 in a matter of 6 weeks unless they had an impending deadline that they needed to crash diet for. Once you've dug yourself into a hole where your metabolism is so downregulated that you can't even lose fat eating 1600 calories per day with frequent cardio, you have no other move than reverse diet yourself out of the hole to rev your metabolism back up. You can't expect your body composition changes to be favorable once you have forced yourself to adapt to what your body perceives to be sudden starvation. Just because a calorie calculator says you are in a huge deficit and you should continue losing fat at X rate, your body does not care. When metabolic adaptation downregulates your “maintenance calories” to much less than that, numbers on paper don't mean a thing, and your results will show that. Your body is now in a state of extreme stress to hold onto everything for dear life to prevent you from withering away and dying. If you are starting to cut, start with the 300-calorie deficit and go from there. In general (doesn't apply if you have a short-term deadline you need to crash diet for), I like to start with a 300 calorie deficit per day and not change a thing until I've plateaued for a full week. At that point, I either restrict another 100 calories (usually coming from carbohydrates), or increase my cardio session duration by 5 minutes, or add another cardio session in per week with the same current duration, or introduce a fat burner at the lowest effective dose. Those are the options. I either increase my energy expenditure, or I reduce my calorie intake. When I reduce my calorie intake or increase my energy expenditure, it is in a small increment and then I milk all of the fat loss out of that increment until metabolic adaption causes my body to downregulate again. Once I can no longer yield any additional fat loss out of that change for a full week, then I look at the next incremental change after that point. Which would then be another 100 calorie restriction, or increase in cardio duration, or add another cardio session in with no change in duration, or increase my dose of fat burners (if safe), or introduce another fat burner if there is another compound I have not yet deployed that also has a strong efficacy profile. There are so many options available to start the fat loss process again that you should never be in a situation 8 weeks deep into your cut where you're eating less than 2000 calories per day and plateauing. If 24 hours passes and I don't lose weight, it's not the end of the world, and it certainly does not mean I need to drop another several hundred calories. This mistake can ruin months of work as you only have one option once you've dug yourself into a hole like this, and that is to rev your metabolism back up with a sustainable amount of calories. I strongly advise that you prime your body during each off-season and gain as much muscle as possible (without exceeding 15% body fat). If you've primed your body correctly and gained muscle during the off-season, you should be able to end your subsequent cut phase as lean, or leaner than your previous cut while eating more calories than you did during your previous cut. This is one metric I use to assess whether or not a bulk and cut phase was successful or not.

    "content": "Chris Hemsworth’s Steroid Cycle – What I Think He Took For Thor     There is a lot of speculation around whether or not Chris Hemsworth's transformation for Thor was natural, or if he did a steroid cycle during his prep for the film in 2009. Chris Hemsworth purportedly gained between 20-25 pounds of muscle in 6 months to prepare for his role of Thor [R]. I do not believe it was a natural transformation, and I'm going to outline exactly what I think he took, as well as the dosages he used.

This athletic looking physique with about 15% body fat is pretty typical for a young man with a half decent metabolism. Chris doesn't look like anything special here, and does not have much muscle on his frame. This is what his physique looked like in 2007 at the tail end of his appearances in Home And Away.  Chris claimed that prior to Thor, he had never strictly weight trained with the intention of packing on muscle. Natty Chris Hemsworth In “A Perfect Getaway” (2009) A Perfect Getaway was filmed from March 31st, 2008 – May, 2008 we can see that Chris packed on a little bit of mass for this role.  While he isn't as big as he became for Thor in 2010, we can start to see his genetic shape as he packs on some lean tissue. Chris was likely still natural here, but may have started weight training by this point. Natty Chris Hemsworth In “The Cabin in the Woods” (2011) The Cabin in the Woods is the best glimpse we get into a “before” of Chris before filming Thor as it was filmed from March 9th, 2009 – May 29th, 2009. In this movie we can see exactly what Chris' physique looked like almost exactly 6 months before filming for Thor began in 2010. Chris looks slightly leaner in this movie than he did in A Perfect Getaway, but does not look like he packed on any additional muscle.  At this point, Chris already secured the role as Thor and knew how much muscle he had to pack on over the remaining months in the year, so it is likely that he had already started resistance training in some capacity during the time frame this movie was filmed in.  I believe Chris was still natural in The Cabin in the Woods. Gaining 20-25 Pounds Of Muscle In 6 Months For His Role In Thor (2011) After filming for The Cabin in the Woods finished at the end of May in 2009, Chris had about 7 and a half months to pack on as much muscle as possible for Thor. Thor was filmed from January 11th, 2010 – May 6th, 2010, as well as October 10th, 2010 – October 31st, 2010. Chris claims he didn't lift weights prior to preparing for Thor. Chris didn't show his physique very much in the movie Red Dawn, which was filmed between September 8th, 2009 – December 11th, 2009, so the physique we see during The Cabin in the Woods serves as our best benchmark for a before and after transformation. Over 6 months following the filming of The Cabin in the Woods, Chris added 20-25 pounds of fat-free mass to his frame, and completely transformed his physique.  Even as an untrained natural newbie with amazing genetics, it is nearly impossible to gain 20-25 pounds of muscle in 6 months. With that being said, I do not believe that Chris actually gained 20-25 pounds of pure muscle. It was probably closer to 15 pounds, with an additional 5-10 pounds of temporary water and nitrogen retention, and with a portion of that last 10 pounds also being fat gain.  He's not much leaner in Thor compared to his last role, if at all. Considering that, some might start to consider that this transformation may be possible naturally. It is debateable, but I believe that the nail in the coffin for Chris is when you reference what his physique looks like between his appearances as Thor. He is clearly not capable of sustaining that level of mass year-round. It really isn't that hard to maintain muscle mass on steroids. Even if you train just a few times a week and eat a clean diet, you should be able to hold onto everything you have with TRT dosages with ease. The only exception to this are bodybuilders with such an unnatural amount of muscle that they need to be on a low dose blast year round to maintain their size, but obviously this does not apply to Chris Hemsworth, myself, or likely you either. Clearly he eats at least moderately clean year round, otherwise he wouldn't stay as lean as he does. Considering that, he would literally have to stop working out entirely to lose the amount of muscle he does between his Thor appearances to lose that muscle if he stayed on TRT year round. The rate at which he loses the majority of his size between movies is a flagship indicator of steroid cycling. When you compare Chris Hemsworth's physique in different movies, it is pretty clear that there is a night and day difference in muscle mass in his Thor appearances relative to other roles. Even including roles where he has gotten very lean, like Rush in 2013. From what I can see, Chris Hemsworth's physique peaked in size for the first Thor movie, and during his Thor prep in 2009 is likely when he used the highest dosed steroid cycle that he has ever used for the entirety of his career.  Maintaining Muscle For His Role In “The Avengers” (2012) The Avengers was filmed from April 25th, 2011 – September 4th, 2011. https://youtu.be/szn4EKNlZUg?t=46 Chris appears to be a bit smaller in this role than he was in the first Thor movie, but clearly put in the work to attempt to replicate that look again for this movie. Losing Muscle For His Role In “Rush” (2013) Rush was filmed early to mid-2012 [R]. This was less than a year after The Avengers was filmed. This is first role we can see that Chris clearly dropped a significant amount of his Thor mass for. Chris appears to have 10-15 pounds less fat-free mass in Rush, but actually looks a bit leaner than he did in Thor.  Whether he was natural for this role or not is tough to say, as he is still much more muscular than he was in Home And Away. Chris Hemsworth discussed in several interviews how difficult it was for him to drop enough muscle mass for his role as James Hunt in “Rush” [R, R]. Can you attribute that to just training less and eating less? Perhaps, yes. However, the fact that Chris stated how difficult it was to lose muscle mass for the role is also a red flag that implies that he was unnatural when he filmed this movie as well. If you go from being enhanced to natural, the muscle will fall off your body with ease during calorie restriction. You would also not stay as lean as you were when you were enhanced. The fact that Chris Hemsworth's physique appeared to have lost muscle and a bit of extra fat, and the difficulty he stated he had with losing that muscle implies that he was still on a steroid cycle during his preparation for this role. The dosage was probably much lower though, or he could have had residual amounts of androgens still clearing his system from his previous showing as Thor in The Avengers. It's hard to lose muscle on steroids, even during calorie restriction. It is not hard at all to lose muscle when you are natural and deprive yourself of calories. Gaining Muscle Back For His Role In “Thor: The Dark World” (2013) Thor: The Dark World was filmed from September 10th, 2012 – December 14th, 2012.  Within just a few months of filming Rush, Chris packed on a decent amount of size for the second Thor movie again. Losing Muscle For His Role In “Blackhat” (2015) Blackhat was filmed in May, 2013.  Chris lost the mass he had in the second Thor movie within a few months to play this role, and I believe he likely accomplished that just by going off cycle.   Losing Muscle For His Role In “In The Heart Of The Sea” (2015) In The Heart Of The Sea was filmed in September, 2013. This was the most shocking transformation to the public, as a viral picture taken by Chris started circulating which showed him looking emaciated for his role in the movie.  I believe the hype around this transformation was a bit exaggerated, as he clearly still has a fair bit of muscle on his frame in the after picture. He's still more muscular and leaner than he was in Home And Away, but the way he's posing and the lighting is unflattering on purpose to make the transformation look as dramatic as possible. With that being said, he clearly lost size for Blackhat, and took the weight loss to another level for a short stint when filming In The Heart Of The Sea a few months later in September of the same year.  Gaining Muscle Back For His Role In “Avengers: Age of Ultron” (2015) Filming for Avengers: Age Of Ultron occurred between February 11th, 2014 – August 6th, 2014.  Chris went from looking like an emaciated version of himself to looking muscle bound for Thor again in only 4-5 months. Is he as big as he was in 2009 when he prepared to film the first Thor movie? No, I don't think so, but he's definitely not far off. The lighting is poor in this clip, so it is hard to say for certain, but he obviously packed on the majority of the size again in a short time span.  With the muscle memory Chris developed from his previous bulking phases and the state of calorie deprivation he put his body in, the rebound back to a muscle bound Thor was probably fairly easy for him during those 4-5 months. What he used to prepare for the first Thor movie, he likely used again to prepare for this role at the tail end of 2013 before filming started in 2014. Regardless of how you much you want to may want to believe a transformation like this is possible naturally, 99.9% of humans can't stay the same level of body fat and gain 20 pounds, lose 20 pounds, gain 20 pounds, lose 20 pounds of lean tissue back and forth like this. The amount Chris fluctuates between roles and between his showings as Thor is very indicative of exogenous hormone use in my opinion. Losing Muscle For His Role In “Ghostbusters” (2016) After the 2015 Avengers movie, Chris downsized again and we can see this in his 2016 roles that were filmed in 2015, as well as in his interviews in 2016.  Gaining Muscle Back For His Role In “Thor: Ragnarok” (2017) Filming for Thor: Ragnarok occurred July 4th, 2016 – October 28th, 2016 and in July, 2017. This is probably the leanest Chris has gotten for any appearance as Thor, although I believe he was still a bit bigger in the first Thor movie.  He's leaner and dryer than he was in the first Thor movie, but with what appears to be 5-10 pounds less overall mass. With that being said, this is yet another example of Chris transforming his body in a short time span to play Thor. https://youtu.be/rkHi1g_G3HU?t=13 As Chris gets deeper into his 30's, the need for exogenous anabolic support becomes even more necessary to support these quick transformations, and is just another red flag that his preparation for his appearances as Thor are likely completed with hormonal assistance. Chris Hemsworth's Steroid Cycle Which Steroids I Think He Used Based on the fact that Chris' biggest physique was in the first Thor movie, as well as factoring in that it was the first time Chris gained that size (it is harder to gain muscle the first time around due to muscle memory), I'm going to elaborate on what I believe he took to prepare for that movie in particular. Chris' Hemsworth trainer said that he gained 20 to 25 pounds of muscle in 6 months. That number could be inflated, and I think that it is more likely that Chris gained 20 to 25 pounds of fat-free mass, not dry tissue. That would include temporary water retention, nitrogen and blood volume. With that being said, the amount of muscle he gained in the given time frame was still very unnatural.  My best guess is that Hemsworth just took Testosterone to prepare for his first appearance as Thor. It has the best safety profile and clinical efficacy out of any human approved steroid, and it is just a no brainer go to for a first steroid cycle. In addition to that, he's sporting a very watery and full look in Thor. He looked dryer in both Rush and Thor: Ragnarok than he did in the first Thor movie. He doesn't have a crazy androgenic dryness to his physique either. That full look is advantageous for appearing as big as possible for Thor though, despite having a bit more intracellular water than would be ideal from a bodybuilding perspective. With the goal being as much fullness and size as possible while maintaining a reasonably lean level of body fat, it is very likely that Testosterone was the compound of choice for this transformation. Looking as inflated as possible was the goal, and I believe he accomplished that. I doubt he stacked anything on top of that because it wouldn't have been necessary to achieve these results. A supraphysiological dose of Testosterone was more than sufficient. To determine what dose of Testosterone Hemsworth used for his transformation, we can extrapolate data from clinical studies conducted on healthy young men to get a better idea of what he likely took to achieve the results he did in the time frame given. Testosterone Dose-Response In Healthy Young Men The Study Parameters This study evaluated the results of weekly administrations of Testosterone at dosages of 25 mg, 50 mg, 125 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg for 20 weeks in healthy young men [R]. Keep in mind when you interpret these results that fat-free mass also accounts for water, it is not just pure muscle tissue. As you would expect, the higher the Testosterone dose used, the more aromatization occurs. The more aromatization there is occurring in the body, the more water retention will also occur, which is going to play a role here too, as it did in Chris Hemsworth's transformation.  Methodology  Nutritional intake was controlled The exercise regimen was controlled The dose was controlled Used pharmaceutical-grade testosterone  Energy and protein intakes were standardized at 16.33 calories per pound per day, and 0.544 grams per pound per day. Participants were instructed to not partake in strength training or moderate-to-heavy endurance exercise during the study. The only thing that differed between the participants was the dosage of Testosterone administered. Results By looking at the body composition analysis in this study we can see that there was an expected dose-dependent response in muscle accrual across all groups.  25 mg Testosterone per week caused a drop in muscle mass due to the fact that endogenous androgen production was suppressed in the young men due to the presence of exogenous androgens, and the exogenous androgen dosage was lower than what would normally be endogenously produced naturally. With 50 mg Testosterone per week, they're about breaking even here. 125 mg Testosterone is where things start to get very supraphysiological in terms of dose-response and the literal androgen load in the body significantly exceeding what a healthy young man would produce naturally. On average, a healthy young man produces between 3 to 10 milligrams of Testosterone per day naturally.  In the 300 mg Testosterone treated group, fat-free mass increased by 5.2 kilograms. In the 600 mg Testosterone treated group, fat-free mass increased by 7.9 kilograms. 7.9 kilograms is just shy of 17.5 pounds. That means that over the span of about 5 months, healthy young men were able to gain 17.5 pounds of fat-free mass using 600 mg of Testosterone with a subpar protein intake and without even doing any weight training. Those 2 factors will significantly impair potential muscle accrual, and we can expect that someone eating an optimized diet for bodybuilding and training hard with progressive overload could expect fat-free mass gains likely in the 20-25+ pound range. This is where we can extrapolate the data and draw it back to exactly what I believe Chris used, and the duration of his use. What Dosages I Think Chris Hemsworth Used To Prepare For Thor Based on the dose-response study I outlined above, we can see that healthy young men gained upwards of 17.5 pounds of fat-free mass over a 5 month time span without even adhering to a strict resistance training plan or eating an optimal amount of protein for hypertrophy.  Relating this back to Chris Hemsworth's body transformation, we already know he gained 20-25 pounds of fat-free mass over the course of 6 months. He was eating a strict diet tailored for hypertrophy, as well as following a very intense bodybuilding regimen (or at least we can assume it was intense). Factoring in Chris' strict adherence to a tailored diet and training protocol, I would assume that he likely took between 400 to 600 mg of Testosterone per week for the last 6 months in 2009 leading up to filming Thor in 2010. Chris Hemsworth's physique was at his biggest in the first Thor movie, so that was likely the highest dosed steroid cycle he has ever used in his acting career to prepare for a role. It was also the first time he had ever packed on that size, which further solidifies that he likely took the highest dose of steroids he has used over his entire career to prepare for this first appearance as Thor. It is much easier to gain back lost muscle via muscle memory and previously accrued myonuclei than it is to gain fresh new muscle for the first time.

    "content": "Does Trenbolone Cause Alzheimer’s Disease? | What The Data Shows     After clinical data started circulating in the bodybuilding community showing that Trenbolone administration caused beta amyloid plaque accumulation in rat brains, more and more attention has been given to the potential neurodegenerative effects it may have in humans, and how Trenbolone may cause the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Without even delving into the clinical data, most will agree that Trenbolone blatantly exhibits some worrisome effects on cognitive health. If you've used it, I'm sure you can attest to the fact that no other steroid is on par when it comes to the effects it seems to have on the mind. The fact is, it is one of the most volatile steroids for cognitive health and mental state. Some guys can't even use it because it gives them such bad mental side effects.   Table of Contents ToggleThe Effect Trenbolone Has On Your MindThe Trenbolone Dosage Protocol In Humans Via Negma Laboratories (Parabolan)Trenbolone Contributes To NeurodegenerationTrenbolone Causes Beta Amyloid Plaque AccumulationShould You Ever Use Trenbolone Based On The Neurotoxicity Data?The Vicious Circle Of Deep Sleep, Beta Amyloid Plaque And Alzheimer's ProgressionTrensomnia And How Trenbolone Can Potentially Cause Alzheimer's DiseaseHow To Track Your Sleep QualityRelated The Effect Trenbolone Has On Your Mind Trenbolone is jokingly (but also fairly accurately) called the “relationship destroyer” drug. Aggression and volatility of your mood can occur with any androgen, and the degree to which this happens is largely dependent on the androgenicity of the steroid in question. If you have an aggressive personality, increasing your body's androgen load is going to exacerbate that. Trenbolone in particular though seems to have a bit of a different effect that is not found with any other compound. Some guys feel great, but many feel extremely anxious, paranoid, have volatile mood swings, and are much more easily agitated when compared to how they feel using other anabolic-androgenic steroids. I don't think it's a coincidence that the rats that had Trenbolone administered to them in the clinical studies experienced significant neurodegeneration. The Trenbolone Dosage Protocol In Humans Via Negma Laboratories (Parabolan) The dose is the poison when it comes to steroids, and Trenbolone is no different. The first thing to take into consideration when it comes to the neurodegenerative impact Trenbolone has on humans is the dosage deployed for bodybuilding purposes. Trenbolone abuse is rampant in the fitness industry nowadays, and teenagers on their first steroid cycle are using Trenbolone dosages higher than what farmers use to beef up cattle.  Trenbolone has no place in a first cycle, nor does it have a place in any cycle except for a couple token scenarios in my opinion. Pharmaceutical grade Trenbolone used to be produced for human use by Negma Laboratories under the brand name Parabolan, but there were no published human trials. It was pulled from the market in 1997 and is no longer approved for human use. The Trenbolone dosage used in a clinical setting for humans was purportedly three 76 mg Parabolan ampules per month. This equates to approximately 50 mg of active hormone per ampule after cleaving off the ester. This had a front load period of three Parabolan ampules over the first 15 days, followed by a maintenance phase of one Parabolan ampule every 10 days thereafter.  114 mg Trenbolone Hexahydrobenzylcarbonate (75 mg active hormone) per week for the first two weeks 76 mg Trenbolone Hexahydrobenzylcarbonate (50 mg active hormone) per 10 days thereafter  IFBB Pro bodybuilders in the 90's had success with Trenbolone following similar dosage protocols. Does that mean that those dosages were safe? No, not at all. But, there is a dose dependent increase in risk with this compound, and the dosages unnecessarily being used nowadays are insane to say the least. Based on the clinical data, we can see a dose dependent accumulation of beta amyloid plaque in the brains of the rodents administered Trenbolone, which more than likely has significant crossover into humans. Trenbolone Contributes To Neurodegeneration The study that drew the most attention to Trenbolone's effect on neurodegeneration is titled: “17β-trenbolone, an anabolic-androgenic steroid as well as an environmental hormone, contributes to neurodegeneration [R].” This part of the study is the most notable: “Trenbolone accumulated in adult rat brain, especially in the hippocampus and in the fetus brain, it altered amyloid-beta-42 accumulation. Trenbolone induced apoptosis of primary hippocampus neurons in vitro and resisted neuroprotective function of testosterone.”  Apoptosis is cell death. Trenbolone not only caused cell death of neurons in the brain, but it caused amyloid-beta-42 to accumulate in a dose dependent manner. Trenbolone Causes Beta Amyloid Plaque Accumulation The male rats given Trenbolone injections had amyloid-beta-42 (also referred to as beta amyloid) accumulate in their brains.  Alzheimer's disease is believed to be caused by the accumulation of the beta amyloid peptide. While there has been no human trial to assess if this occurs in humans, and there probably is never going to be, I think it is best to assume the worst when we see data like this. As I already touched on, I do not think it is a coincidence that guys get very strange mental side effects from Tren that they don't get with other compounds. Beta amyloid plaque build up doesn't just occur with Trenbolone use obviously, and our body does have internal mechanisms in place to clean the brain of it each day. Healthy individuals clear beta amyloid out of the brain during deep sleep via glymphatic drainage. Basically, beta amyloid builds up and then the brain cleans it up during deep sleep. If sleep quality and/or duration is impaired, expectedly, drainage via the glymphatic system is impaired too, and beta amyloid plaque then starts to accumulate over time, which can eventually cause Alzheimer's disease and a myriad of other neurodegenerative outcomes. This is why so many neurodegenerative diseases have been linked to poor sleep quality. If you don't have enough “brain cleaning” occurring each night because of poor sleep, you will eventually pay the toll in some way with impaired cognitive function. While this is a rodent model, if you're injecting something that has shown to increase the literal compound in your brain proven to be the root of Alzheimer's disease in a dose dependent manner, you can surmise that this probably isn't the best compound to be using on a consistent basis. Should You Ever Use Trenbolone Based On The Neurotoxicity Data? Remember, the dose is the poison with any drug. While Trenbolone isn't safe and will be more neurotoxic and cardiotoxic the higher the dosage deployed, you can't argue with the fact that it is an amazing drug for body composition. I believe Trenbolone has a place in a competitive bodybuilder's toolbox pre-contest. Trenbolone has shown to be more protein sparing than other steroids, and is why it shines so much in a calorie deficit during a contest prep phase [R]. When it comes to protein accretion though (muscle building), Trenbolone does not outperform other compounds that have significant amounts of human-based safety, efficacy and tolerability data for us to reference. There are other hormones just as effective at building lean muscle mass, without as much potential risk associated with screwing up your brain. Considering this, the only time short-term use of Trenbolone makes sense is during the last couple months of a contest prep. There are a lot of guys using Trenbolone during every single cycle, which is overkill. Although purely anecdotal, I've personally seen guys who cruise on Tren year round progressively act more and more “off” each time I saw them. Its almost like you can just tell there is a screw loose that wasn't loose before with guys who abuse Tren. Using Trenbolone short-term pre-contest is a calculated risk, and I would advise limiting its use, or avoiding it entirely if you can. The Vicious Circle Of Deep Sleep, Beta Amyloid Plaque And Alzheimer's Progression Dr. Matthew Walker is a scientist and professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California. His research focuses on the impact of sleep on human health and disease. In the following clip he describes the role that sleep plays in modulating the accumulation of amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain. I highly recommend that you watch the entire thing, or read through the transcription I wrote out below, as it elucidates exactly how sleep impacts cognitive health and neurodegenerative outcomes, and also provides insight into exactly how Trenbolone abuse will likely encourage the progression of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration. At the end of the article I tie together Matthew Walker's points outlined in the clip and relate it back to how it applies to Trenbolone use, as well as how to track metrics that will help you assess your cognitive health and sleep quality.  “Of those electrical deep brain waves of deep sleep. It seems as though they come from all over the brain. But the principal epicenter that generates your deep sleep sits right there in the middle part of the prefrontal cortex. It is exactly the same part of the brain that accumulates toxic beta amyloid protein. Then, we've done studies, and other people have done studies before us, that have demonstrated as we age, our sleep gets worse. But not just any type of sleep, especially that deep quality of sleep that we know and we spoke about is critical for saving, learning, and retaining new memories. All of these jigsaw pieces started to get put together. In my head, I thought we need to do some studies. Is it possible that the amount of amyloid that you have in the brain in this sleep-generating center, it should directly predict the deficit in the amount of deep sleep that you get? If it predicts the deficit in the amount of deep sleep, it should predict the deficit in your ability to hold on and retain new memories, which is a hallmark cognitive feature of Alzheimer's disease: difficulty learning, difficulty retaining. We did the study, and that's exactly what we found: the more beta amyloid that builds up in this central frontal part of the brain, the less the deep sleep that you have; the less amyloid-related deep sleep that you had, the more forgetful you were the next day, rather than the more that you remembered. This was the first part of the Alzheimer's sleep equation, which is that Alzheimer's disease attacks the deep sleep-generating regions, and you have a diminution of deep sleep, which, in turn, blunts your learning and memory abilities, and you become more forgetful. A far more important discovery was made by another group, far more important than the one we made, which was essentially the reverse direction. Which was to say, rather than amyloid sort of decreasing sleep, could sleep actually decrease the amount of amyloid that you get. This was a discovery that was made in rats back in 2009. I believe it was the first evidence that was published in science. This is a colleague, Dr. Neta Garden, who is out on the East Coast at University of Rochester. She made two wonderful discoveries. The first, was that we've known for a long time the body has a waste sewage system called the lymphatic system. But the brain doesn't have its own lymphatic system: the lymphatic system does not penetrate the brain. Where does all of the garbage, the metabolic garbage, go that your brain cells produce? Where's the sewage system for the brain? She discovered it. It's actually made up of a set of cells called glial cells, which are the supporting brain cells. So, she called it the “glymphatic system” rather than the lymphatic system. Your brain does have a sewage system: this glymphatic system. That's the discovery that she made. Remarkable! Then, and I'm not quite sure what motivated her to do this, she started to measure how efficient that lymphatic waste system was. When the rats were awake and when the rats were asleep? What she found was that it's during deep sleep, that these brain cells actually shrink by almost 60%. When we sleep, blows my mind, it's almost like all of the buildings in New York all of a sudden shrink, and it leaves these much greater large areas for the cleaning crews to come in and clean up all of the metabolic detritus of the city's activity during the day. That's exactly what happens during sleep. The cleaning solution is what we call cerebrospinal fluid. Through a pulsatile mechanism during sleep, you get a 10 to 20% increase in the bathing of cerebrospinal fluid through the brain, which washes away all of the metabolic byproducts that have been building up. One of those metabolic byproducts is beta amyloid. In fact, if you deprive those rats of that deep sleep, you immediately get an increase in toxic beta amyloid. Now, we've linked these terms, right? It's a long story. But if you're not getting enough deep sleep at night, you're not giving yourself the chance for the kind of good “night-and-sleep clean process” to remove the beta amyloid, so more beta amyloid builds up. Where does it build up? Tragically, in the very same regions of the brain that generate the deep sleep that you need to clear out the toxic amyloid. So, you start getting less deep sleep, so you get more toxic protein; more toxic protein, less deep sleep, less deep sleep. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's a nonlinear exponential curve. If you look at how amyloid builds up in the brain, and if you look at the trajectory of Alzheimer's disease, it is a nonlinear exponential curve. It fits exactly what the sleep-dependent model of amyloid-clearance would predict, if you're not getting sufficient sleep. That's the reason why now insufficient sleep seems to be one of the most significant lifestyle factors determining that. Now, you could say, by the way, those studies were in rats, and you deprive them of sleep for one night, what about humans, like, surely? Well, the study is now being done. Great study done out of “Wash U” by a team of scientists, led by David Holtzman. They took a group of humans and they did this very clever method where they deprive them of deep sleep, but they didn't deprive them of sleep. You think that sounds paradoxical. I can play you these auditory tones. Now, this is not like the memory reactivation word that you play a tone and then you leave the brain alone for a while. Here, I'm just going to keep playing tones to your brain, really sort of annoying tones. I can play them at a level that doesn't wake you up, but it lifts you out of deep sleep and keeps you in shallow sleep. What's delightful about this method is that I can selectively excise one type of sleep, deep sleep, but I don't wake you up. There's no stress of awakening. You are asleep for the same amount of time, but the quality of sleep is decreased. Can street noise do that? We don't know. Although, I will come back to that when we speak about, hopefully sleep, appetite regulation, sleep glucose regulation, and sleep in low socio-economic. I think it's possible there's other factors that link poor sleep in low SES socioeconomic backgrounds. Is noise pollution one of them? I actually think it is. Untested, as yet. But what they did with these human participants, they selectively removed deep sleep while keeping them asleep. Total sleep time has not changed. Then, in the morning, they woke them up, they rolled them over, and they did a spinal cord puncture, lumbar puncture, and they measured the cerebral spinal fluid that was percolating within the spinal cord which also goes around the brain. You can measure the amount of beta amyloid, which is a reflection of perhaps how much amyloid is there within the brain. After one night of essentially a loss of deep sleep, you saw an immediate rise in the amount of beta amyloid. It is a causal manipulation, that insufficient sleep in rodents and in humans, will lead to a rise in beta amyloid. I think it was like 25 to 30%. It was. It was. Yeah.” Trensomnia And How Trenbolone Can Potentially Cause Alzheimer's Disease As Matthew outlined in the clip above, the area of the brain that beta amyloid plaque builds up in is the same area of the brain responsible for getting into the stage of deep sleep required for cleaning beta amyloid out of your brain. What I found most interesting about this is the fact that in humans, one of the main side effects of Tren most commonly reported that is unique to that compound is something called “Trensomnia.” Trensomnia is the insomnia and poor quality sleep that many get when using Trenbolone. Trenbolone is notorious for ruining sleep quality, and that is just one of the attributes of Trenbolone that make it unique from other steroids. I think that in itself makes it pretty clear what mechanism is likely occurring with Trenbolone use not just in rodents, but in humans as well. Trenbolone use inhibits deep sleep severely, which in turn results in impaired beta amyloid clean up via the glymphatic system, consequently increasing the amount of beta amyloid plaque accumulation in the brain, which ultimately results in neurodegeneration. The more beta amyloid that builds up, the worse the quality of sleep becomes, and the worse the quality of sleep becomes, the more beta amyloid plaque will accumulate. This is the vicious circle Trenbolone can have on the brain, at least in theory. Is Trenbolone going to cause Alzheimer's disease? I don't know. But it seems pretty damn convincing that Trenbolone abuse will at least result in some level of neurodegeneration based on this correlation here, as well as what we see all the time anecdotally in humans who abuse this compound. If you've used Trenbolone before, you can likely personally attest to how significant of an impact it has on your sleep quality. Imagine what Trenbolone is doing to the brains of men using it year round. Are you ever actually getting enough deep sleep to clean up beta amyloid accumulated in the brain when you're on Trenbolone? If you're abusing Trenbolone you are probably more likely to get cardiovascular disease before you get full blown Alzheimer's, but that does not mean that you should abuse it based on the fact that neurodegeneration is a slow and long-term process. How To Track Your Sleep Quality A very interesting experiment would be to assess Oura ring metrics before and during Trenbolone use. I use an Oura ring every single night to track my sleep metrics.  The Oura ring will give you metrics as accurate as you're going to get without literally going in and getting an elaborate and expensive sleep study done with medical-grade equipment. The ring will estimate with a fairly high level of accuracy how much sleep you're getting per night, your REM sleep, deep sleep, resting heart rate, heart rate variability, body temperature, among several other useful metrics. If you're an anabolic steroid user and you have established average baseline metrics of your sleep quality with the Oura ring and then you introduce Trenbolone into your protocol and suddenly your metrics show that your deep sleep has been severely impaired, I believe that would be more than convincing for me to make an assertion that Trenbolone will dramatically increase your chance of getting Alzheimer's disease.

    "content": "How To Break Through A Plateau On A Steroid Cycle | Logical Steroid Use Practices     When I first started getting into bodybuilding and learning about pharmacology, a strategy I would see commonly advised on forums and by industry gurus was switching compounds at week 6 or week 8 to avoid androgen receptor downregulation and circumvent a plateau on a steroid cycle. This strategy is still used just as commonly today. Basically, the hypothesis was that you should be switching steroids every 6-8 weeks, or else your body gets used to them and they will stop working. At the time, this made complete sense to me. Logically you would think that if you use a steroid your body will eventually get used to it and then you will have to switch steroids to keep your body guessing. Almost like muscle confusion. An example of a “good” bulking cycle based on this widespread belief will commonly look something like this:     Testosterone Enanthate Nandrolone Decanoate Trenbolone Enanthate   Week 1-8 500 mg 400 mg    Week 1-16 500 mg   400 mg    At week 8, according to bro-science, your body is now too used to the Deca and switching compounds to something like Trenbolone is necessary to continue growing at the same pace. Besides the fact that the Deca is actually going to be in your system anyways occupying androgen receptors for months past the point of switching compounds, objectively to many newbies learning about this stuff for the first time, this cycle might look good.  Over the years as I've done more research, I've started to realize how ridiculous this bro science switching compounds theory is. It actually gets under my skin that somebody didn't publicly come out with the truth dispelling this myth sooner, as it would have prevented me from using compounds with far less favorable side effect profiles that I didn't even need to use to achieve my goals.

Steroids bind to the androgen receptor and transcribe anabolic and androgenic effects in tissues in the body. Interestingly enough, the human body generally responds in almost the same way to any anabolic steroid, as they all more or less do the same thing at the end of the day. “After 1935 the best method of discovering and measuring the protein-building action of androgenic steroids in humans proved to be metabolic balance studies.  In 1955, when anabolic steroids with less androgens were developed, the nitrogen-balance method was used again to evaluate and compare the nitrogen-sparing effect of the various preparations.  The findings of the numerous balance studies that were performed are as follows: The injectable 17 beta-esters, such as nandrolone phenylpropionate, nandrolone decanoate and methenolone enanthate exert a strong anabolic action for several weeks, amounting to 2-2.50 g nitrogen/day, which corresponds to a daily gain of 12-15 g protein or 60-75 g lean body mass.  The orally active 17-alkyl derivatives induce a dose-dependent nitrogen-saving effect of the same order.” Nitrogen retention and protein accretion were roughly the same between all of the steroids evaluated in the study above, which are all compounds commonly switched in and out of cycles nowadays [R]. Some steroids are more tissue selective, some will antagonize SHBG and/or Estrogen more than others, some will result in a dryer cosmetic look that differs from another, but when it comes to lean muscle growth, they all more or less do the same thing in a nitrogen retention context. Considering this, it would be wise to choose the most well tolerated anabolic agents with the lowest risk profile you can to accomplish your bodybuilding goals. If nitrogen sparing is more or less the same between two compounds, but one has far less clinical data backing its safety profile and tolerability, why is it that so many guys are reaching for the highest risk compounds they can whenever given the opportunity? It is not uncommon nowadays to see bros reach for something like DHB (Dihydroboldenone) instead of Nandrolone because of the exotic appeal, and they heard a couple bros on the forums say that it is “like Tren without the side effects.” Use something with zero data on humans and had sh*t results in the one preclinical rodent model published on it, or use something with lots of clinical data that has proven for years to be one of the most well tolerated mass building agents we can deploy? I'm sure you can figure out what the logical choice is here. Androgen Receptors Upregulate In the Presence Of Androgens, Not Downregulate Switching compounds at week 8 is done to avoid a potential plateau on a steroid cycle by circumventing the supposed androgen receptor downregulation that occurs after a couple months on the same steroid. The fact is that the complete opposite occurs. Androgen receptors upregulate in the presence of androgens, not downregulate.  Androgens facilitate their anabolic effects in tissues through their action on multiple cellular targets. Testosterone increases satellite cell replication and activation, the number of myonuclei, and increases protein accretion. The myogenic effects on cellular differentiation, proliferation, and muscle protein turnover are accomplished through multiple signaling pathways via the androgen receptor. Androgen receptors, in the satellite cell as well as several other muscle cell types, are upregulated by androgens [R, R]. We've known this since the 80's [R]. If androgen receptors don't downregulate with steroid use, then what is causing muscle growth to slow down and plateau? The main factor that appears to play a role in muscle growth inhibition is the elevation of a protein in the body called Myostatin. How Myostatin Inhibits Muscle Growth Myostatin is a protein in the body that acts as a regulator of skeletal muscle mass, limiting how much muscle the body can grow [R]. Examples of Myostatin deficiencies are found in lab based rodent models, as well as in the farming industry with Myostatin deficient cattle. Myostatin Knockout Mice Mice that lack the gene that creates Myostatin have approximately twice as much muscle mass as normal mice [R].  Belgian Blue Double-Muscled Cattle The Belgian Blue has a Myostatin gene mutation, consequently preventing its feedback loop of muscle growth inhibition from working correctly. This mutation interferes with fat deposition and can lead to accelerated lean muscle growth. The acceleration of muscle growth in Belgian Blues is due primarily to physiological changes in the animal's muscle cells (fibers) from hypertrophy to a hyperplasia mode of growth. This growth occurs in the fetus and results in a calf being born with two times the number of muscle fibers as a calf without a Myostatin gene mutation [R].  Myostatin Elevates In Response To Androgens While there are likely other counterregulatory mechanisms in the body that inhibit excessive muscle growth, the main factor appears to be Myostatin elevation. Your body doesn't experience androgen receptor downregulation by week 8 that would then make switching compounds necessary, rather, Myostatin elevates in response to supraphysiological amounts of exogenous androgens and inhibits muscle growth, regardless of what compound is being used. Switching from NPP to EQ at week 8 will change absolutely nothing when it comes to androgen receptor sensitivity and breaking a plateau. Myostatin increases to prevent you from gaining unhealthy amounts of muscle. When you take your Testosterone replacement therapy and your Testosterone binds to androgen receptors, do you eventually have to increase your dose of Testosterone or cycle off of Testosterone to make your TRT work again? Of course not. Just like you don't need to cycle off of your own balls producing Testosterone, because they bind to the androgen receptor in exactly the same way and do not downregulate it. The only thing that downregulates is your ability to accrue muscle mass in response to androgen receptor activation because of the elevation of inhibiting mechanisms in your body, namely Myostatin. When you hit week 8 of a cycle and Myostatin is elevated because of your use of supraphysiological amounts of androgens, your body is trying to prevent you from gaining an unhealthy amount of muscle. This is why you plateau on a cycle, not because the steroid you are using just stops working. In the following study, the effects of exogenous Testosterone and Trenbolone on Myostatin levels was evaluated [R]. This study showed that after 29 days of administration of either Testosterone or Trenbolone, Myostatin protein levels were 197% higher in the castrated and Testosterone group, and 209% higher in the castrated and Trenbolone group when compared to the placebo.  There's a reason why this mechanism is in place in our bodies and we can't grow linearly. Too much of anything is not going to be good, and when you try to push your body to a place that isn't healthy, homeostatic mechanisms in the body will try to stop you. The human body is a big balancing act. More Androgens = More Myostatin = More Muscle Growth Inhibition As previously outlined, Myostatin is a growth inhibitor that elevates in the presence of androgens. Based on the current research it appears that the higher your dose of exogenous anabolics, the greater muscle growth potential you have, and consequently the higher your Myostatin will elevate in parallel to inhibit absurd rates of muscle growth. In a study evaluating the effect graded doses of Testosterone have on Myostatin levels in young and older men, Myostatin levels were significantly higher on day 56 than baseline in both groups [R]. The Myostatin hypothesis isn't air tight and has some holes in the data contradicting its muscle growth inhibiting effects. However, based on what we know to date, the research suggests that its more than likely the main regulatory mechanism involved in muscle growth response relative to androgen receptor activation. Myostatin is well known to negatively regulate muscle mass in mice, cattle, dogs and humans [R]. Why Switching Compounds To Deal With “Downregulation” Is A Bad Idea Switching compounds to break through your plateau will make no difference on your outcomes. At the end of the day, Myostatin will elevate relative to the anabolic stimulus in the body. Increase your Testosterone more, Myostatin will elevate. Switch from Primobolan to Masteron at week 8 and what will happen? Nothing, androgen receptors are already upregulated and sensitive enough to do what they are supposed to do, but Myostatin will remain elevated regardless of what compounds you switch in and out. If you experience a plateau on a cycle, switching steroids doesn't circumvent the root of the issue. If you switch to something stronger, then Myostatin will only increase even more to match this increase in androgen load in the body. Switching from Nandrolone to Tren, to EQ, and just randomly swapping things in and out has no effect on transcription at the androgen receptor, the only thing that will change is your body's production of Myostatin relative to your doses and muscle growth potential (and potentially other undiscovered counterregulatory factors as well). The main problem with switching compounds in this manner is that you could be using a thoroughly studied compound with very good clinical outcomes, high tolerability in humans, and a very favorable safety profile (e.g. Testosterone, Nandrolone, or Primobolan), and then end up switching to a compound with a far less favorable safety profile riddled with side effects just to achieve the same rate of muscle growth you already had achieved with the safer option. Bodybuilding gurus will tell their clients to switch from Deca to Trenbolone at week 8 in the offseason simply because of this androgen receptor downregulation broscience, and then put their client in a terrible position where they are using a far more risky compound to achieve nearly the same level of nitrogen retention in the body. I can't even fathom how many times this has happened now where a bodybuilder will be using thoroughly studied compounds with hordes of clinical data on humans and switch to some obscure, high-risk steroid with nearly identical muscle growth potential based solely on this androgen receptor hypothesis. I vividly remember all the bulk phases I did in the past where I would hit week 8 and then wonder what I should do. If you're using Nandrolone and you get to week 8, what do you swap to? Switch to another 19-nor? Trestolone? Or am I going switch to Tren during the offseason because my Nandrolone has “stopped working” at week 8? This is the kind of information that hordes of clueless coaches are pushing on their clients. You could be on a strong foundation of androgens with a great efficacy profile and then have your cookie cutter guru come out and tell you that you need to switch to a compound that's more dangerous and no better at building muscle than what you're using because the compounds you're using are “no longer working,” when it just isn't the case whatsoever. Remember, these compounds all more or less do the same thing, so doesn't it make sense to choose the compounds that build the most muscle with the least side effects, and to stick with those as your staples? Certain compounds that produce a unique cosmetic look of the muscle should be reserved for pre-contest use only in my opinion, as muscle growth can be achieved during a mass building phase with less risky options. What To Do After You Plateau On A Steroid Cycle And Myostatin Is Elevated Once you get deep enough into a cycle, you will plateau. Now that we have established that the proper course of action IS NOT switching compounds to overcome this nonexistent androgen receptor downregulation, what exactly can you do? You have a few options here. Increase Your Calorie Intake This should be the first thing you do. Every time you plateau, try increasing your calorie intake a tad. As little as an additional 100-200 calories per day can be enough to get you gaining again. Do this until you plateau in strength and size gains and the subsequent increase in your calorie intake just results in more body fat gain. Increase Your Dose Once you can no longer break muscle growth plateaus by increasing your calorie intake, that is when increasing your dose of exogenous anabolics is a reasonable strategy to deploy. Taper up your dose SLOWLY. This means as low as an additional 50-100 mg on top of your current weekly dosage, and that's only after you have milked all the growth you can out of the last incremental dosage increase. Just like you taper up your weights in the gym, or your calorie intake in the kitchen, dosages should be titrated up slowly. After you increase your weekly dosage, milk all you can out of that incremental titration, and then once you plateau with that go back to step 1 and try increasing your calorie intake again. Rinse and repeat. Remember, the higher your doses are, the more your body will fight back, so you should milk the most muscle growth out of each incremental increase in your dosages possible before you increase your dosages again. I wish I had known this before I ever delved into the world of performance enhancing drugs, as I unnecessarily stressed my body out several times using dosages higher than I needed. How far can you take this strategy? Well, as far as you want based on your risk tolerance, up to a point. Anecdotally, most men will experience significantly diminished returns after passing 1500-2000 mg per week of steroids. Should you ever get this high to begin with? Probably not unless you are a competitive bodybuilder who has aspirations of becoming an IFBB pro. When Myostatin and other counterregulatory mechanisms in the body force you into a plateau, all you can do is increase your nutrient intake, or increase your dosages, and then milk that until Myostatin and other inhibiting factors elevate again to match that new level you have imposed on your body. These regulatory mechanisms will continue to elevate to match your intake, so how far you push this before cleaning out is up to you. I know some guys who will titrate all the way up to 2 grams of gear per week and 5000+ calories of food per day over the course of several months. I also know guys who look great who never go over HRT doses of Testosterone. What you deem overkill will be based on your health markers, risk tolerance, and personal goals. Go Off Cycle Eventually you will have to go off cycle to reset Myostatin (or lower your dose down to therapeutic TRT levels if you need to be on HRT). If you stay on a high dose of AAS for months, you will eventually plateau. Regardless of how advanced you are or how high your dosages are, once you decide you don't want to push your body further with additional nutrients or drugs, you will need to go off cycle to lower the inhibiting mechanisms in your body back to baseline.

    "content": "Topical Estrogen Cream For Hair Loss Prevention – My Experience And Review     I've been asked a few times about topical Estrogen cream for hair loss prevention. BiEstro-Care cream and Estrogel in particular. BiEstro-Care is a is a combination of 1 mg of natural Estriol USP and 0.25 mg of natural Estradiol USP per pump. I've also tried their Estradiol-only topical, Estradiol Care. Each full press of the pump provides approximately 0.1 mg of natural Estradiol USP in that topical preparation. I've also tried pharma grade Estrogel, which is an FDA-approved, bioidentical 17β-estradiol transdermal gel at 0.06% w/w strength.  The hypothesis in the community is that the topical Estrogen cream will bind to Estrogen receptors in the scalp and produce a more conducive environment for hair loss prevention without going systemic as it remains localized on the scalp. Think of it like topical Minoxidil vs oral Minoxidil. The topical version doesn't go systemic to the same degree, and still exerts significant pro-circulatory effects.  Localized Estrogen Receptor Activation On paper, it is easy to extrapolate the potential benefit of being able to topically apply Estradiol or Estriol and get some sort of localized binding with a relative lack of systemic estrogenic activity. However, it just doesn't seem to work like that in practical application. I noticed absolutely no difference on my hair growth or hair loss prevention, whatsoever. It's also not very predictable in terms of pharmacokinetics in the body going through the scalp. Does Topical Estrogen Cream Promote Hair Growth I can confirm that topical Estrogen cream on the scalp is very poorly absorbed and has minimal impact on hair growth, or the progression of androgenic alopecia. I checked my blood work via a high sensitivity assay (LC/MS-MS) and I was actually shocked at how poor the systemic absorption was through the scalp. If your goal is to try and maintain physiologic amount of systemic estrogen fulfilled via transdermal administration of topical Estrogen cream, you will likely be unsuccessful. The absorption through the scalp is extremely poor. I was drenching my head in this stuff to really test it out. Even when I had several milligrams of Estradiol cream on my head per day, my E2 levels were low. The hypothesized topical localized effect on Estrogen receptors also doesn't seem to play out as we thought it may. I noticed no additional growth out of it, and feel that it is an overhyped growth agonist that may just do more harm than good. The most notable biomarker that changes with topical Estrogen cream on the scalp is Estrone, which goes through the roof. To date, I have never seen anyone actually get good results from topical E2 to begin with, and any cases of regrowth with its use were in cases where other therapies were used in conjunction with it. Anybody who deploys this as a form of monotherapy to prevent hair loss will be disappointed with their lack of results in my opinion. At the end of the day, preventing hair loss at the root of the issue just boils down to managing your overall systemic androgenicity relative to systemic estrogen levels. My Verdict On Its Efficacy For Hair Loss Prevention As a growth promoting agent (what it would mainly excel at), I feel that is probably not even worth exploring to be honest. It certainly doesn't seem to exert any antiandrogen-like effects at the androgen receptor either that would justify its use in my opinion.

    "content": "Quad Injection | Why You Should NEVER Inject Your Quads     Never do a quad injection. There are other shot locations that are far better and I'm going to elaborate on why in this article. When you first get into this stuff and you're trying to learn about proper administration technique the main shot locations you'll see recommended are glutes, quads, and maybe delts. More often than not, guys are advised to pin their glutes or quads. Quads are the absolute worst place to pin in my opinion, and I advise you avoid it like the plague. While I haven't researched about this specifically, purportedly there are more blood vessels in the quads, which can increase your likelihood of causing hemorrhaging and the build up of a hematoma. In addition, the quads are very nerve dense and it is far more likely that you will hit a nerve and cause muscle twitching during a quad injection. Also, if you get post-injection pain (PIP) in your quad, you severely inhibit your ability to function as you need to limp around on your leg and it can significantly impede simple day to day activities. Sure, you may have injected your quads hundreds of times with no problems. I had the same experience, I had perfectly sterile oil, perfect shot technique, and still eventually had a shot go awry. No matter how perfect your shot technique is, how sterile everything is, how perfect everything is laid out in your sequence of events for proper sterile administration, the likelihood that you will eventually have a shot that goes wrong in your quads I believe is much higher than with any other commonly used shot location.   Table of Contents ToggleMy Quad Injection MishapPost-Injection PainThe Best Injection SitesRelated My Quad Injection Mishap I've never had an infection. However, I did have one shot in my quad go awry several years ago. For no good reason at all, my quad started inflating with blood to the point where I needed to get it drained. There was no abscess, there was no infection. Clearly I pierced through something that resulted in hemorrhaging, and the build up of a hematoma in my quad. My leg swelled up with blood to the point where I couldn't even bend it. My body would have eventually absorbed all that blood and been fine as there was no infection, but the pain was just too intense to deal with, and it would have taken months to drain naturally. So, I had a slit cut in my upper outer quad and drained the entire thing. There was so much blood and pressure built up that a projectile bloodstream smashed into the wall across the room after the slit was made in my quad. Immediately after I had instant relief, and then my leg healed up and was fine. This was using the exact same sterile testosterone I use for my TRT and there wasn't even an infection. The technique was also perfect. There was no good reason for it, my leg just started hemorrhaging from the needle. Post-Injection Pain Even if you don't have a really bad shot that forces you to make a trip to the hospital, the likelihood is high that you will eventually encounter some level of PIP that cripples you to the point that you can barely walk. You depend on your legs to walk, and on top of that, it would be wise to avoid injecting areas that could visibly deform you in the first place should you ever encounter a complication or an infection. This is why I would not inject arms, delts, and after that ordeal, not quads either. It would be wise to avoid nerve dense muscle groups like the calves entirely as well. Unless you're pinning 10+ cc's of gear per week, there is no need to even rotate to your quads to begin with in the first place in my opinion. Choose injection locations that get sufficient blood flow and are the least important areas cosmetically should they get infected or have a complication arise. Also, they won't prevent you from being able to walk properly if you get a bit of PIP. The Best Injection Sites The two best injection sites in my opinion are the glutes and the ventro glutes. The ventro glute is an area that nobody seems to know about, but it is bar none the best injection site in my opinion. It is used most often in a clinical setting for intramuscular injections and can handle significantly more oil than most other sites, it gets a lot of blood flow, it is easy to reach if you are heavily muscled and inflexible (unlike the glute), and in general it seems to have the best overall risk profile out of all injection site options. The easiest way to find this spot is by leaning onto the leg on the side of your body that you're trying to make the ventro glute jut out from. You'll see the muscle pop out on the side when you put weight on that leg. For landmarks and a precise way to locate the ventro glute, I advise following the guide in the following video:  The ventro glute is the ideal injection site in my opinion, and it is my main go-to spot for pinning my TRT. Steer clear of your quads. It is the absolute last place you should be pinning in my opinion, especially if you pin high volume. The higher volume you pin, the higher the likelihood of encountering some major issue during a quad injection. Even if that issue is just PIP, having PIP in your quads that makes you limp isn't something you should ever have to deal with to begin with.

What this study intended to assess specifically was if rats would have a greater likelihood of experiencing fear and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when their ghrelin levels are artificially raised 24/7 with a ghrelin receptor agonist (MK-677). Rats were continuously administered MK-677 and frightened constantly, and their difference in response (MK-677 treated vs non treated) was assessed.  The rats with chronic ghrelin elevation were found to have enhanced fear memory compared to baseline [R]. Like I mentioned, there's evidence to support that one of the ways ghrelin is modulated is through exposure to stress, and this study was able to stir up quite a bit of controversy in the community with its results showing a blatantly negative effect on the amygdala where the fear-enhancing effects of repeated ghrelin receptor stimulation seemed to be concentrated in. Ghrelin and growth hormone act together in the amygdala to enhance fear, at least in this rodent model. How Does MK-677 Work? If you don't already know, ghrelin is the hunger hormone. As you would expect, ghrelin levels are high before meals, and low after finishing meals. This is how your body regulates its appetite and knows when to eat and when to stop eating. GHRP’s and GH secretagogues don't just signal GH secretion, some also have a very significant effect on ghrelin. The most notable being GHRP-6 and MK-677. These are both notorious as appetite stimulating compounds. This is why peptides like GHRP-6, GHRP-2, and secretagogues like MK-677 cause such a drastic spike in hunger. When you use them, you're basically tricking your brain into thinking you're hungry when you otherwise may not be. Growth hormone is secreted by the somatotrophes of the anterior pituitary gland in multiple pulses each day. Growth hormone is released into the blood stream and then stimulates the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which stimulates linear growth before epiphyseal fusion and also exerts several metabolic effects throughout life. After ingestion, MK-677 increases somatotrophe secretion of GH via signalling the pituitary gland to secrete a sufficient amount of growth hormone [R, R]. The most common cause of GH deficiency in childhood is believed to be caused by a lack of adequate stimulation of the pituitary gland by hypothalamic GHRH, which is why something like Ibutamoren which can systemically increase IGF-1 levels for 24 hours with a single oral dose is very promising for potential clinical use [R]. The likely mechanism of action following MK-677 administration is the activation of the ghrelin receptor by MK-677, with feedback by IGF-I preventing excess GH production [R]. The mechanism of action through which MK-677 promotes GH secretion is comparable to growth hormone releasing peptides like GHRP-6, GHRP-2, Ipamorelin and Hexarelin, with GHRP-6 being the most similar in regards to the amount of ghrelin secretion that occurs post-administration. MK-677 does not stimulate a greater quantity of secretion events per day (number of GH pulsations), but rather it stimulates a greater total 24 hour GH production rate [R]. In other words, Ibutamoren can substantially increase the strength of each GH pulsation that occurs in the body. Effects of treatment on 24-hour mean GH and IGF-1 and GH secretory dynamics Was This Study Flawed? Rats chronically exposed to ghrelin were found to have enhanced fear memory compared to baseline. There is some confusion around exactly how this test was carried out, and the reality is that the rats weren't getting MK-677 infused into their brains off the bat like many seem to think. In this study, rats were injected with 1ml/kg (i.p.). I.P. stands for Intraperitoneal injection, and is the injection of a substance into the peritoneum (body cavity). The peritoneum is the serous membrane forming the lining of the abdominal cavity. This is where MK-677 was first administered to evaluate whether increased activation of the ghrelin receptor is sufficient for enhancement of fear memory. After they established that activation of the ghrelin receptor is indeed sufficient for enhancement of fear memory, they then proceeded to infuse MK-677 directly into the basolateral complex of the amygdala to determine whether repeated ghrelin receptor activation in the basolateral complex of the amygdala is sufficient to enhance fear memory.  Repeated intra-amygdala ghrelin infusions enhanced fear memory [R]. Now, while this all paints a pretty bad picture for MK-677 at a first glance, keep in mind that this study also showed that a single injection of a ghrelin receptor agonist was not sufficient to enhance fear, and even chronic ghrelin receptor agonism did not alter locomotion, innate anxiety, or the expression of previously acquired fear memories [R]. How Applicable Is This In Humans? In humans, MK-677 has been found to be well tolerated for over a year straight using 25 mg per day orally. Humans aren't injecting this compound, and they certainly aren't infusing it into their brains either. This finding has yet to be replicated in human trials, or even in anecdotal logs to date. With that being said, are they looking for this in the human data? Probably not, and obviously those using MK-677 recreationally aren't getting brain scans before and after their use. You probably shouldn't be chronically exposing yourself to ghrelin in the first place for years on end if you can avoid it. There are auto-regulating mechanisms in your body for a reason. It would be wise to err on the side of caution and cycle MK-677 if you are going to use it anyways, regardless of what the data may or may not imply. Even if there was no neurological risk, I would still advise cycling MK-677 if you are going to take it because of its effect on insulin sensitivity, which I think is a more immediate concern than any extrapolated claims about its effects on brain health. What I'd Be More Concerned With – Insulin Sensitivity We already know that MK-677 and exogenous GH can negatively impact blood glucose control, and we already know that poor blood glucose control is one of the main issues that cascades into the majority of health problems we see widespread nowadays. Chronically elevating your blood sugar with MK-677 is going to have a negative impact on your insulin sensitivity to some extent. Although several clinical studies found no change in blood glucose levels, there were a couple studies where MK-677 caused an elevation of fasted blood glucose levels and decreased insulin sensitivity [R, R]. GH causes blood sugar levels to rise, which in turn requires the pancreas to work harder to compensate and release insulin to bring blood sugar levels back down to homeostasis. Chronic GH elevation can create chronic pancreatic stress in certain scenarios, which eventually can result in pancreatic beta cell degeneration, and insulin resistance. Chronic blood glucose elevation and pancreatic cell degeneration is what eventually leads to Type 2 Diabetes. Individuals with other lifestyle factors that contribute to insulin resistance as is (excessive carbohydrate intake, holding too much body fat, lack of exercise, etc.), or have genetic predispositions that increase their likelihood of Diabetes, could potentially end up pushing themselves over the brink and become Type 2 Diabetic with MK-677 or synthetic growth hormone usage. MK-677 can also cause reverse hypoglycemia in insulin resistant individuals. When MK-677 or GH raises blood glucose levels, this is autocorrected and regulated by the pancreas in healthy individuals. In insulin resistant individuals, MK-677 can cause reactive hypoglycemia, whereby sharp spikes in blood sugar can cause an exaggerated level of insulin secretion and glucose uptake into the cells, consequently crashing blood sugar and causing hypoglycemia [R]. This poor endogenous regulation of blood glucose levels is typically indicative of some degree of insulin resistance in an individual. Signs and symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia may include hunger, weakness, shakiness, sleepiness, sweating, lightheadedness and anxiety. I believe that long-term MK-677 use will probably force you to to implement blood sugar control strategies that you wouldn't have needed to otherwise. If you're a borderline type II diabetic to begin with, and you throw MK into the mix long-term, that could easily push you over the border. For somebody completely healthy, you could potentially take yourself from completely healthy to like mildly insulin resistant if you deploy MK for years straight without breaks. Much like the same occurrence if you used a high dose of growth hormone for a long span of time, it would impede your blood glucose control to some degree. This doesn't mean that you can't use MK-677 or exogenous GH without developing insulin resistance, I'm simply asserting that you will likely have to keep a closer eye on your blood sugar, and may have to start incorporating certain strategies into your lifestyle that you may have not needed to otherwise to remain as healthy as possible while using it. Getting back to the effect MK-677 has on stress and fear, I don't think it's going to cause any notable mental degradation, and all of the clinical data and anecdotal logs seem to reinforce that. With that being said, throwing a wrench into your stress feedback loop may have deleterious outcomes that we are simply not evaluating with accurate metrics, and with that in mind, it would be wise to cycle MK-677, especially if it is being used for performance enhancement and not to treat a GH deficiency. If it is being used therapeutically for GH deficiency, obviously that is a different story. Monitor Your Glucose Control And Insulin Sensitivity I think the more immediate concern when it comes to MK-677 is insulin resistance rather than the speculated neurological degradation that doesn't seem to occur with its use in practical application at commonly used dosages in humans. We do know MK-677 has a notable impact on blood sugar not just in the long-term, but immediately following its first administration. In addition, the excessive amounts of ghrelin MK-677 causes the body to secrete will cause overeating in many individuals. The population is fatter than ever, and has already shown that they have horrible self-control when it comes to refraining from overeating. Add a ghrelin receptor agonist on top of that that literally tricks their brain into thinking that they are even hungrier and you can just imagine what the outcome of that would be for the average guy. In my opinion, this is the main concern with MK-677, not fear memory enhancement. If you are going to use MK-677 or exogenous GH, keep a blood sugar monitor on hand and keep a close eye on your fasting blood glucose levels, your blood glucose control post-meals, and incorporate lifestyle, diet, or supplement protocols that will prevent the excessive amounts of ghrelin and spike in GH/IGF-1 from impairing your health status. MK-677 has a lot of therapeutic promise, and can even enhance a performance enhancing protocol significantly if used correctly. Knowing how to minimize your risk profile while you use it though is critical and should be well thought out before you haphazardly start taking it without any prior research.

    "content": "Does Lactobacillus Reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 Probiotic Help Prevent Hair Loss? | My Review     Lactobacillus Reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 is a strain that was hyped up in the community after an article was published called “Probiotic ‘glow of health': it's more than skin deep” [R]. In the article, you can see that the mice that were fed with this probiotic strain experienced significantly better hair growth, and also exhibited a much more favorable ratio of anagen to telogen hair cycle stages. The majority of the article elaborates on how promising this probiotic strain is for hair growth, skin health, as well as overall health in general. Of course, I had to try this myself to see if there was any crossover in humans.  My Experience With Lactobacillus Reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 It was really hard to come across to find this exact strain. After digging for several hours, I found one company that sells it. I bought several months worth and took it diligently every single day. After using it for several months, I can confirm without a shadow of a doubt that it made no noticeable difference on my growth rate. Obviously, these images and results look really promising.  When you see a mouse experience significant improvement in their hair growth with the only factor changed being this probiotic, you can't help but assume this is very encouraging data. But, not everything in rodent studies translates into humans, and this is one of those cases where the probiotic I don't think is worth adding to your regimen. My Verdict Save your money. The Lactobacillus Reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 probiotic strain doesn't work well for hair loss prevention, if at all. With that being said, I'm not asserting that probiotics aren't good for health. Good gut health does have some impact on levels of shedding, and potentially even androgenic alopecia in general. Inflammation and the inflammatory response in your scalp is obviously tied to your gut health at the end of the day. But, as far as the potential of this strain in particular inducing a unique growth effect that you wouldn't get otherwise get, it just isn't the case.

    "content": "Oral Castor Oil For Hair Loss Review – My Experience And Others     After I made my first oral castor oil for hair loss post a couple of months ago, I received hundreds of DM's, private messages, YouTube comments, emails and tweets asking me to post an update. Well, here it is. After trying oral castor oil for hair loss for 2 months, I have concluded that it is an effective growth promoter, and is far more potent than topical castor oil. Is it more effective than Minoxidil as a growth promoter? No, however, it has a more tolerable side effect profile, is far cheaper, and provides results that are at least noticeable enough to justify it being worthwhile to explore further. There are VERY FEW compounds that can effectively promote a healthier rate of growth. The 2 most effective in my opinion are Minoxidil and MK-677. However, that doesn't mean that they are sustainable long-term options for every one. With Minoxidil, circulatory issues can be a major problem for some, and with MK-677, glucose control and insulin resistance may pose an issue with long-term use. When considering the side effect profile for micro-dosing oral castor oil for hair loss, the worst side effect I have heard of so far is an upset stomach. Fortunately, if your digestive system doesn't agree with castor oil, it is pretty easy to tell and immediately lower your dose, or discontinue your use. This is what I noticed personally using at least 1 mL per day for 2 months straight.   Table of Contents ToggleOral Castor Oil and Digestive IssuesA Glowing Review Sent In By A SubscriberMy ResultsCastor Oil Long Term Safety ProfileMinoxidil Vs. Castor Oil EfficacyOral Castor Oil Vs. PGE2 Applied To The ScalpWhere Does Castor Oil Fit Into A Hair Loss Prevention Protocol?Where To Buy Food Grade Castor OilRelated Oral Castor Oil and Digestive Issues When it comes to digestive issues, I've had none so far using as much as 1.5 to 2 milliliters per day. On a typical day I will just take 1 mL, but occasionally I will bump it up. There is no rhyme or reason to it, I just want to see how well I can tolerate up to 2 mL, but then some days I decide I probably don't need that much and should stick with 1 mL. When I first started researching about oral castor oil for hair loss, there were a few guys who suggested that there is a point of diminishing returns once you hit 2 mL, and anything above that starts to put you into laxative territory. However, as more and more people have tried this, it seems more likely that there is a dose dependent improvement in results. So, there is a possibility that the more you can tolerate the better it will be for hair, but that will be individual dependent at the end of the day, and will only be determined via personal experimentation. Gut health is very sensitive. Some people can't even drink a cup of milk without destroying their guts, and then some people have iron stomachs and can eat like crap and be fine. This is all individual dependent at the end of the day. I will probably try tapering up in the future to see how high I can get my daily dose without digestive distress. Despite the fact that I haven't had any digestive issues as of yet, that doesn't mean that it isn't common. Over the past few months, I've spoke with dozens of individuals who have also tried oral castor oil for hair loss. While the majority of them found that it was effective, a handful of them discontinued because of gut issues. If you have compromised gut health as is (actually pretty common), adding castor oil on top of it probably won't help. I would recommend optimizing your gut microbiome before you start taking oral castor oil, as it is fairly common to cause digestive distress, even at low dosages. In general, it seems like most are having fairly good outcomes with high levels of tolerability. One of my friends did actually discontinue because he thought that the quality of his sh*ts had started to show signs of digestive issues. However, he was taking 5 mL per day. In addition to that, his diet isn't 100% on point. As mentioned, for me there's been no difference, so far. I'm keeping it in my protocol for now and for the foreseeable future. A Glowing Review Sent In By A Subscriber I received this email shortly after posting my first video on castor oil and felt that it was worth including in this post. His personal information is redacted for privacy.  Since I posted this article, a couple testimonials were commented on the YouTube video that I felt were worth including as well.   My Results I do think that oral castor oil has positively impacted my growth rate to a notable degree. I definitely have to shave more often and get my hair cut more frequently now. I think my hair might even be getting a bit darker too, but that could just be me seeing things. It's definitely growing quicker though without a doubt. Mainly what it seems to do well is offset the cosmetic look of hair loss. By improving your rate of growth relative to your rate of loss, you can create a more favorable ratio of hair follicles in the anagen phase relative to the catagen phase. While this isn't directly preventing further loss be addressing the root of the issue, it can help you keep more hair on your head, and ultimately maintain a fuller head of healthy hair. If you're a diffuse thinner, the benefits of oral castor oil will be even more evident as your issue more or less boils down to a horrible ratio of catagen to anagen activity. Keep in mind, if all you're using is growth promoting agents like Minoxidil or oral castor oil, you're fighting an upstream battle. The best strategy in my opinion is to lower your rate of loss as much as you can with compounds that address androgens directly, and then stack growth promoting agents on top of that. If you only use growth agonists like Minoxidil, you will eventually run into the inevitable problem where androgen induced miniaturization has progressed so much that the artificial increase in circulation you've induced with Minoxidil is no longer sufficient to offset your loss of hair density. Androgens are still wreaking havoc on your hair even when Minoxidil is in your system if you do not have something in your protocol that addresses androgens directly, or a part of the cascade that occurs as a consequence of androgens. Simply increasing circulation with a potassium channel opener is not going to be sufficient to stave off androgenic alopecia. I use the analogy of trying to row a canoe up a stream against the current to describe hair loss prevention. If you try to row against the current, you might be able to hold your ground for a while, but you're fighting an uphill battle and the current doesn't stop. Ideally what you would do is get the current to stop before you even get in the water (things like anti-androgens, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, SARMs, Estrogen modulation, PGD2 inhibitors, etc.), and then get in the water and deploy your growth agonists as needed based on risk profile and tolerability (microneedling, oral castor oil, Minoxidil, growth hormone secretagogues, etc.). With that being said, growth promoting options that appear to be fairly low risk (like microneedling) make sense to deploy concurrently with whichever strategy you have in mind for tackling androgens off the bat. Castor Oil Long Term Safety Profile Tolerability as a laxative sheds light on the safety of micro-dosing oral castor oil for hair loss prevention in the short term, but in the long term, that remains to be seen.  According to the Food and Agricultural Organization and World Health Organization, up to 0.7 milligrams per kilogram of castor oil per day is safe for men [R]. Oral castor oil is also generally recognized as safe and effective for use as a stimulant laxative by the FDA. I've been using one milliliter per day on average, which is next to nothing by clinical standards. Women are given upwards of 60 milliliters in a single dose to induce labor [R].   For constipation in adults, 15-60 milliliters in a single dose is commonly prescribed and generally recognized as safe [R].  Minoxidil Vs. Castor Oil Efficacy Minoxidil is a more effective growth promoter than oral castor oil. However, oral castor oil seems to have a much better side-effect profile.  In addition, this isn't a one or the other choice that needs to be made. They can be used in conjunction with one another for an even better effect. When you compare them to one another, Minoxidil will win hands down in efficacy. However, oral castor oil will not cause you to shed horribly when you start it, and it also won't cause a massive shed if you stop taking it. Both of which are huge limitations of Minoxidil. Minoxidil use backs you into a corner, and you have to think long and hard before you introduce it into your protocol as it can be very mentally taxing to make it through the initial shedding phase, and if you encounter intolerable side effects, you will have another shed when you stop using it. In addition, forcing the potassium channels to open more can have deleterious outcomes on the cardiovascular system, and it isn't uncommon for individuals to report premature aging of their skin with Minoxidil as well. Those are two massive limitations of its use that oral castor oil does not seem to have. Don't get me wrong, Minoxidil can be a great addition for some individuals, but it is certainly not a low-risk treatment and should be approached with caution. The only limiting side effect of castor oil that I'm aware of as of now is its gastrointestinal effects that may not be tolerable for all individuals. Other than that, it's extremely cheap, seems to have a very favorable risk profile, and is at least in the same ballpark as Minoxidil in regards to efficacy. That is more than you can say for any other growth promoting agent out there with a stamp of safety approval by the FDA. The only other growth promoting agent I can think of off the top of my head that's formidable to Minoxidil and oral castor oil is MK-677, or literal growth hormone injections. But, is that really a long-term sustainable practice just for hair density? Ideally, you don't want to potentially put yourself in a state of compromised blood glucose control just so you can get a better growth rate on your head. When it comes to growth promoting agents, I believe that oral castor oil is one of the most cost-effective and well-tolerated options there is for a beginner. Oral Castor Oil Vs. PGE2 Applied To The Scalp The reason oral castor oil works is the Ricinoleic Acid in it that increases PGE2 in the body as discussed in my first post. Logically, one would assume that using straight PGE2 instead of oral castor oil would be even more effective for hair growth, as the end goal of using castor oil in the first place is increasing PGE2 in the body. In practical application though, oral castor oil actually seems to work better than literal topical PGE2. In the past, I would microneedle my scalp at 1.5 mm depth and then apply straight PGE2 to my scalp afterwards. In theory, this seems like a great idea to tip the scales in the body to a more favorable PGE2 to PGD2 ratio. After a lot of experimentation, I believe that oral castor oil is superior for a few reasons. The first being that PGE2 is extremely expensive. Castor oil is literally 1/1000th the price (maybe even less). In addition, PGE2 is measured in such small quantities (micrograms) that trying to avoid overdosing it while still getting sufficient scalp coverage is near impossible. By using castor oil, you give your body the ability to regulate how much PGE2 it converts, rather than overloading your system with a massive spike in PGE2 that could potentially have deleterious consequences long term. Also, the results I got from oral castor oil were better than what I experienced with diligent PGE2 applications. Now, at the end of the day, this all still stems back to androgens causing this whole cascade of events. The whole process can be mitigated just by addressing the Testosterone and DHT at the beginning. But, obviously for people that aren't willing to manipulate their hormone profile, or aren't willing to implement certain things that they perceive as too experimental, things like castor oil can be excellent additions to a protocol. And for those who are willing to manipulate their hormones a bit more, or use higher risk treatment options, castor oil is still something I see as a potentially low risk addition to help solidify a strong, comprehensive regimen. Where Does Castor Oil Fit Into A Hair Loss Prevention Protocol? Something that will be asked is how oral castor oil compares to traditional treatment options. Castor oil operates via a totally different mechanism of action and cannot be compared to things like Finasteride, or Dutasteride, or RU58841, or even PGD2 inhibitors. The compound accomplishes what its meant to do, but it will not replace anti-androgens, or other compounds meant to do completely different things in the body. At the end of the day, a comprehensive protocol should address all factors, or address the root of the issue early enough in the cascade so sufficiently that nothing else matters. You can't compare a PGE2 agonist to an anti-androgen, so keep that in mind. Where To Buy Food Grade Castor Oil You want to buy 100% castor oil, not Jamaican black castor oil. It's clear and a pale yellow color. Food/Pharma grade (USP or BP) is ideal as it ensures a high enough standardization of Ricinoleic acid. Ricinoleic acid is the component of castor oil that boosts PGE2 and we care about. NOW Solutions Castor Oil is third party tested and meets our criteria for a high quality Castor Oil, and is also what I use personally.

Other Pre-Workouts On The Market This is the most maxed out formula on the market in all aspects. The full daily dose is 2 scoops. Even a half dose (1 scoop) is still far more potent than the majority of other pre-workouts out there at their max dosages. Basically, I just included exactly what I would want to see in a pre-workout, even at the obvious detriment of our margins. I’ve talked about how this is going to be an industry disruptor quality product. I shake my head every time I see some massive fitness influencer launch their own supplement company and then talk about why their company is better and different than the rest. The reality is, they don't even know what they're selling half the time. They employ others to manufacture their products, or use a pre-made formula their manufacturer uses for every company where they just slap a different label on it and sell it for a huge margin. At the end of the day, most fitness influencers have no idea what goes into making an effective product. They don't know how their products work, they probably wouldn’t even use them if they didn’t sell them, they didn't formulate them, and they have to pay the overhead involved with having a team under them who is responsible for all of that. As you’ve already experienced with Gorilla Mind Nootropics, it is me formulating the products, and they work because I actually put in them what I would want in a product and buy myself if I didn’t have a company. The same applies with Gorilla Mode. If I didn’t have this product, I would be using a pre-workout with a fat dose of L-Citrulline, a solid hit of stims, a saturation dose of Creatine, and all of the standard ingredients that you and I both know work, but companies will still skimp out on so then you either have to buy more, or buy their other “stacks” that will only yield an effective dose if you combine them. For example, why is it that pre-workouts never just have 5 grams of Creatine Monohydrate per serving? It’s not hard to do, and it is actually pretty cheap to put in there. The reason is, they want you to go buy their creatine product, and will intentionally manipulate their ingredient profile to be deficient in several areas to make you buy more stuff from them. With my products, everything is turnkey. You don’t need to go buy a separate creatine product from us, you don’t need to go buy our pump product (which I will probably eventually make because I want a stimulant-free pre-workout) to get a maxed out dose of L-Citrulline, you don’t need to stack extra stims on top of it, everything you need is in this one product for you. Flavor And Mixability The flavor we chose to start with was Tiger’s Blood, which is a mixture of watermelon, strawberry and coconut. We also developed a fruit punch flavor and a mango peach flavor, both of which were very good. We might add these flavor options to the Gorilla Mode product line in the future as they were probably more mainstream appealing flavor choices. *January, 2020 Update: We now have Mango Peach available.  The branding for Tiger’s Blood was just too good for us to pass up though, and the flavor is still probably a 7 or 8/10 so we ran with it. Mango Peach is easily a 9 or 10/10 flavor, even for the pickiest of tongues. As there’s such a high concentration of ingredients in this formula we were really happy with how the flavor systems turned out. We were expecting something this potent to be nearly impossible to avoid tasting like ass. Fortunately, that wasn’t the case. It also mixes very well considering the concentration of L-Citrulline, GlycerPump, and all of the other ingredients in this product. You will just have to use a bit more water than you would with your standard pre-workout because there are simply more active ingredients in this product that will require more liquid to mix well. How To Dose Gorilla Mode: Mix 1-2 scoops of Gorilla Mode in 12-14 ounces of water and consume 30 minutes prior to training. Vary the amount of water to achieve your desired flavor level. First time users should begin use with 1/2-1 scoop or less to evaluate tolerance. DO NOT EXCEED 2 SCOOPS IN ANY 24 HOUR PERIOD. Just like with other stimulant based products, if you want to really feel the stimulants hit hard, the less food in your stomach the better. The difference between using stimulants on an empty stomach vs. a full stomach is night and day. You will still get the performance enhancing benefits from the ingredients in the formula if you take Gorilla Mode on a full stomach, but you will almost undoubtedly feel less cognitive enhancement the more food is in your stomach. That’s just how stimulants work and applies to any stimulant based product, not just Gorilla Mode. Gorilla Mode Ingredients Breakdown L-Citrulline – 9000 mg L-Citrulline is the most effective supplement you can use to boost nitric oxide (NO) in the body. Why Nitric Oxide (NO) Is Important Nitric oxide (NO) is made naturally in our bodies and plays a significant role in cardiovascular health. It dilates blood vessels (vasodilation), which lowers blood pressure and increases oxygen in the blood.    Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a messenger to signal blood vessels to dilate, or contract and relax. Sufficient nitric oxide is needed to signal blood vessels to contract or relax to ensure blood is able to flow to and from the heart effectively. Nitric oxide production decreases with age, consequently reducing the elasticity of the cardiovascular system, and impairing the body's ability to ensure sufficient amounts of oxygenated blood are reaching vital organs. Eating enough nitrates and/or supplementing with nitric oxide precursors is very important to ensure that your cardiovascular system maintains optimized function as you get older. In addition, maintaining optimal nitric oxide levels will make you more vascular, allow you to get a much better pump, and improve physical performance. Increased Muscular Endurance Citrulline has also shown to significantly increase muscular endurance, with one study finding that compared to placebo, a single 8000 mg dose of Citrulline Malate increased the number of reps performed per set, on every set after set 2 [R]. The impact Citrulline had on performance increased the more sets were performed. During the last set performed, the group that took Citrulline had a 52.92% increase in the number of reps they could perform relative to placebo. It also decreased muscle soreness by 40% at 24 and 48 hours after the training session compared to placebo. Effect On Body Composition There isn’t much data on the direct effect Citrulline has on muscle growth and fat loss in humans. However, a rodent model assessed the effect Citrulline had on body composition and found that 20 month old rats that were given a diet that included the human equivalent dose of 160 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks had 13% less body fat and 9% more lean body mass relative to the rats fed a standard diet without Citrulline supplementation [R]. Visceral fat mass was also reduced by 32%. The mortality rate of the rats taking Citrulline was 0%, while the standard diet fed rats had a mortality rate of 20%. L-Citrulline is one of the most promising supplements on the market and has significantly more upside above and beyond its increase in vascularity and pumps in the gym. The Maximum Effective Dose Of L-Citrulline Citrulline is found in watermelons. You would need to eat 1.5 kg of watermelon every day to get 3 grams of L-Citrulline though, which is the minimum effective dose [R]. To get the maximum effective dose of L-Citrulline from your diet, you would need to eat 5.0 kg of watermelon per day to get 10 grams of L-Citrulline [R].  Obviously, nobody is going to eat that much watermelon, nor is it a good idea to begin with in my opinion when there are far better ways to allocate your macronutrient/micronutrient intake allotments. This is why L-Citrulline supplementation could actually be worthwhile. The Problem With Citrulline Malate In The Supplement Industry While L-Citrulline is a great supplement to have in your daily regimen, there is a red flag around L-Citrulline supplementation that you need to know about. I'm sure you've seen that some supplements have L-Citrulline in them, and some have Citrulline Malate. Some even say “L-Citrulline Malate”. This is a cheap trick companies use to deceive customers. Citrulline Malate is composed of 50% Malic Acid, unless the ratio states otherwise. Authentic Citrulline Malate is produced by chemically bonding free-form L-Citrulline to DL-Malic Acid. When L-Citrulline is chemically bonded to DL-Malic Acid, the end result is Citrulline Malate, which has unique properties. But the problem with the Citrulline Malate in the supplement industry is that it doesn't have this chemical reaction. It's just Citrulline mixed with malic acid in a big mixing vat in the manufacturing facility. There is no chemical bond like there should be to create authentic Citrulline Malate. It's just the two ingredients being mixed together in a cheap blend, and it's sold as “Citrulline Malate”, or “L-Citrulline Malate”. The reality is that it's just Citrulline stirred up with malic acid. While this isn't a huge deal in itself, the problem lies in the labeling practices companies use to artificially inflate the perceived potency of their product. 6-8 grams is seen as the max clinically proven efficacious dosage in the supplement industry in general. At least, that's what companies will tell you in their marketing. First of all, we already know that the actual maximum efficacious dosage of L-Citrulline is 10 grams per day [R]. In addition, the main issue is that the “L-Citrulline” in their product is actually as low as half of the stated label claim. As mentioned, Citrulline Malate is just a mixture of Citrulline and malic acid. Somehow, companies are getting away with labeling their products with the chemically bonded form Citrulline Malate and claiming they have 6-8 grams per serving in their pre-workout, when they actually just have 3-4 grams of Citrulline and 3-4 grams of malic acid per serving. Instead of labeling the following:  L-Citrulline – 3 grams Malic Acid – 3 grams  These companies are labeling their products like this:  Citrulline Malate – 6 grams  Or like this:  L-Citrulline Malate – 6 grams  Making you think you are getting a high dose, when in reality you are getting the bare minimum efficacious dose per serving of 3 grams. Sometimes, companies will tweak the ratio to be a bit more in favor of a higher Citrulline content relative to malic acid, but this is rarely higher than a 2:1 ratio. So, if you see the following:  Citrulline Malate (2:1) – 6 grams  That just means that the company has 4 grams of L-Citrulline and 2 grams of malic acid per serving. This is the exact manufacturing process involved in producing the L-Citrulline and “Citrulline Malate” you get in pre-workouts in the supplement industry: As you can see, the Citrulline Malate manufacturing flowchart on the right literally just says, “mix”. If this was authentic Citrulline Malate, you wouldn't need to mix L-Citrulline with malic acid, it would be chemically bonded together by the end of the manufacturing process. You're not really getting what you're paying for, and most don't realize this is a tactic in the industry to get better margins and artificially inflate a products perceived efficacy. Even if a pre-workout had what on paper appears to be a top end efficacious dose of 8 grams per serving, how much L-Citrulline are you actually getting out of that serving? 4-6 grams at most. I have yet to see a pre-workout formula actually hit a top end L-Citrulline dosage, and of the ones that get close, they use Citrulline Malate to inflate their label. In addition, even if you had the bonded version (which supplements don't), reacted Citrulline Malate will break apart into L-Citrulline and malic acid right away after its mixed in water. It's all just a trick to artificially inflate a products perceived potency on a label, as each ingredient should be listed separately. Most supplements have malic acid anyways in the “other ingredients” section, which is still an active ingredient that does have some potential performance benefits that you would get from the “Malate” portion of Citrulline Malate. L-Citrulline and malic acid work via a different mechanism of action. Citrulline bypasses the liver and gets converted to arginine, which increases NO levels in the body. Malic acid is a Krebs cycle intermediary that counters lactic acid buildup. How much do you need of each though? With Citrulline, we know where the top end data lies. Malic acid, we don't. There is research on Citrulline and Citrulline Malate, but not much data on supplementing with malic acid to replenish depleted levels as a Krebs cycle intermediary. I don't think we can make a generalized overview on how effective the malic acid component was in the Citrulline Malate research either because we can't determine if the results were derived from the malic acid, the L-Citrulline, or both. After giving this some consideration, I ended up tweaking the Gorilla Mode formula after the first batch and including enough malic acid that I felt was more than justified to include it as a separate active ingredient in the main ingredients panel. As mentioned, malic acid is most commonly used as a filler in supplements, and will be found in small amounts in many product “other ingredients” sections. The only other time it is used is by companies artificially inflating their perceived L-Citrulline dosage. After our initial product launch I started to consider what potential benefit malic acid may have in the gym. If there was some sort of benefit to having a high dose of malic acid, I didn't want to be missing out on that. Considering this, I added 3000 mg of malic acid per full dose to Gorilla Mode. At the end of the day, for vasodilation you should concern yourself with is how much pure L-Citrulline is in your pre-workout supplement. I have yet to see a product with more than 6000 mg of PURE L-Citrulline. I have only seen a handful of products with 6 grams of L-Citrulline, and another handful of products with 8 grams of Citrulline Malate (which only yields 4-5 grams of actual L-Citrulline, with the remainder as malic acid). I put 9 grams of pure L-Citrulline in Gorilla Mode, as well as 3 grams of malic acid separately, so you can get the full benefits of the max dosage of each ingredient and transparently see exactly what you are actually getting in the product. Even if you decide to only use a half dose of this product you will still get 4500 mg of pure L-Citrulline, and the formula is still top notch even when cut in half. Once we put out our stim-free pump pre-workout I will probably put 10 grams of L-Citrulline in that one because I will be able to shave a bit of the manufacturing price off from the stims we won’t be including in that formula. Citrulline Vs Arginine One of the most well-known pump ingredients is Arginine. The problem with L-Arginine is that it is very ineffective at increasing Nitric Oxide synthesis. Logically, you would assume that taking Arginine would be the most effective way to increase Arginine levels in the body. However, this is not the case. Oral L-Arginine is taken up and metabolized by the liver so much that it does not actually effectively increase Arginine levels, and it may even be unsafe to use because of how much excessive urea it yields [R]. L-Citrulline bypasses the liver and passes freely to the kidneys where it is metabolized to Arginine [R]. The most effective supplement that can be used to increase Arginine levels in the body to improve cardiovascular and metabolic health outcomes is L-Citrulline [R]. L-Citrulline supplementation has shown to lower blood pressure and provide atherogenic-endothelial protection [R]. When it comes to NO precursors that significantly improve pumps, nothing beats an efficacious dose of pure L-Citrulline. Creatine Monohydrate – 5000 mg Creatine is the best studied and most effective performance enhancing supplement outside of exogenous hormones and drugs. Creatine’s Effect On Muscle Size And Strength Supplementing with creatine has shown time and time again to significantly improve strength, power output and muscle size [R]. Creatine’s effect on strength is facilitated by increasing the body’s stores of phosphocreatine, which is then used during high intensity exercise to produce ATP [R, R]. Creatine’s effect on muscle size is facilitated by drawing water into the muscle via osmosis, consequently increasing body weight and muscle size. In addition, with the increased strength creatine provides, heavier weights can be used in the gym which provide more stimulus for growth, consequently increasing muscle accrual in the long-term. Creatine supplementation also appears to increase the number of myonuclei that satellite cells will donate to damaged muscle fibers, which increases the potential for growth of those fibers [R]. A typical omnivorous diet provides about 1 gram of creatine per day, which isn’t enough to get the benefits you would from supplementation, and also isn’t nearly enough to support health status and methylation in those with genetic polymorphisms. Creatine’s Effect On Methylation And Health Status About 1 gram of creatine is endogenously produced in the body naturally in young healthy adults [R]. Most of the human body's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle, while the remainder is distributed in the blood, brain, and other tissues [R]. While there are a host of processes in the body that rely on creatine to be carried out optimally (and are often completely neglected), one of the most notable functions of creatine is neurological support [R]. In addition, the endogenous synthesis of creatine relies on a process called methylation. Arginine and Glycine are combined by an enzyme to form guanidinoacetate, which is then methylated into creatine. The problem is that this process is dependent on a mechanism of action that is commonly inhibited in the general population via endogenous Arginine deficiency, Glycine deficiency, or MTHFR polymorphisms. The MTHFR gene codes for an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or MTHFR. This enzyme is needed for the production of DNA and methylation pathways that are essential for all bodily functions. Genetic variations in this gene results in reduced activity of the enzyme and has been associated with cardiovascular disease, neurological defects, some forms of cancer, and a myriad of other diseases and disorders [R, R]. Personally, I am homozygous for C677T of MTHFR, which results in a 80-90% decrease in my efficiency in processing folic acid.  The direct reflection of that in blood biomarkers can be high homocysteine and low B12 and folate levels. I determined this via a simple 23andMe genetics test.  Upwards of 45% of your body’s methylation demands are used to synthesize creatine. For someone with a MTHFR polymorphism, you can put a significant amount of stress on your methylation pathway and deplete far more methyl groups than you should be just to create the 1 gram per day that you endogenously synthesize. We lose up to 2-3 grams of creatine per day because it converts to creatinine and is then passed out of the body via urine. As you can see, adequate replenishment of creatine is probably not being accomplished if you aren’t consistently eating a fair bit of meat or fish. And for those with impaired methylation pathways, supplementing with exogenous creatine is likely the only way creatine replenishment can be achieved. One study found that supplementing with 5 grams of creatine per day lowered plasma homocysteine levels by almost 50% in the subject who is homozygous for C677T of MTHFR [R]. Creatine supplementation can significantly lower the body’s demands for methylation and prevent the depletion of methyl groups. This is why I personally supplement with 5 grams of creatine per day. Do You Need To Cycle Off Of Creatine? No, you do not need to cycle off of creatine. Your body does not get used to it, and long-term use has shown to be safe in healthy adults [R]. GlycerPump™ (65% Glycerol Powder) – 3000 mg Glycerol significantly enhances pumps and performance by hyper-hydrating the muscle with water. Glycerol’s Effect On Hydration, Pumps And Endurance If you drink a lot of water with nothing else in hopes of hyper-hydrating your muscles, the fall in osmolarity in your body stimulates the kidneys to remove most of the excess water within an hour. If you add glycerol to the water, this prevents the drop in osmolarity and can extend the hyper-hydration of your muscles by up to four hours. By adding Glycerol to your pre-workout, you can hold upwards of an extra liter of water via this hyper-hydrating effect. Hydration is one of the most critical factors when it comes to performance. Aside from massive pumps, Glycerol use has shown to increase endurance by as much as 24%, as well as improve aerobic and anaerobic power and performance [R, R]. Only a 2% loss in fluids can result in as much as a 20% decrease in exercise performance. GlycerPump™ Vs Other Forms Of Glycerol We chose the trademarked GlycerPump because it doesn’t clump up nearly as much as other forms of Glycerol powder and it’s more stable. Glycerol is normally a liquid at standard temperature and pressure, and many supplement companies have attempted to create a powder form of Glycerol that is stable. Glycerol products get clumpy, have horrible viscosity and have a short shelf life. Because of this, most companies avoid this ingredient entirely, as it can cause severe clumping within just a couple months of being manufactured. Regular glycerol containing products only yield as low as 10% glycerol, which makes them ineffective, and higher yielding glycerol products can be unstable within complex formulas like ours and result in a clumpy product, or complete product failure. GlycerPump™ is created using unique spray drying technology, yielding a stable powder form of glycerol standardized to 65%. With that being said, I’ve seen firsthand that even GlycerPump isn’t clump-free in high doses when mixed with high concentrations of other ingredients. However, it is MUCH better than other alternatives, and that is why I was able to include it in my formula, albeit with hesitation. Keep in mind, while it is manageable, this is not a clump-free product, and there’s nothing I could do about that if I wanted to include the high concentration of ingredients that I did in Gorilla Mode. Store Gorilla Mode in a cool dry place, and if it clumps, that’s just what comes with the territory with a product dosed like this. I was considering including a complementary Gorilla Mind mini pickaxe with this product partially as a joke and partially being completely serious that you might need it if you don’t finish the product quick enough and it ends up clumping. If it clumps, just get out a knife or spoon and chop it up, and it will still mix fine once it hits the water in your cup. Betaine Anhydrous – 2500 mg Betaine, also called Trimethylglycine, acts as a methyl donor and an osmolyte in the body. Earlier in the creatine breakdown, I briefly outlined the importance of having a sufficient amount of methyl donors available for methylation processes in the body, including the endogenous synthesis of creatine. For some individuals (depending on PEMT gene variations) Betaine can substitute for folate and B12 in the regeneration of methionine and can be choline sparing via this mechanism. It can also provide additional needed methyl donors when over-depletion occurs in genetically predisposed individuals that do not supplement with creatine, or have other deficiencies. As an osmolyte, Betaine helps balance fluid levels inside and outside of cells. The main reason I included Betaine in this formula is for its ability to induce intracellular hyper-hydration. By improving hydration status in cells, Betaine increases the pump you get in the gym, and can help prevent dehydration during exercise. Research has also shown that Betaine supplementation may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as improve digestion and liver function [R, R, R, R]. In a performance enhancing context, Betaine supplementation has also shown to increase power, endurance, muscle growth and fat loss [R, R, R]. How significant will this effect on body composition be in practical application? Negligible in my honest opinion, but the enhanced pump made this ingredient worthwhile to add into the formula. L-Tyrosine – 1500 mg L-Tyrosine is an amazing cognitive enhancing amino acid that acts by balancing neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Its primary role is as the direct precursor to thyroxine and to the neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. L-Tyrosine shines in its ability to improve mental sharpness, focus, energy levels, and cause mood elevation [R, R]. L-Tyrosine Vs N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine L-Tyrosine is the most bioavailable form of Tyrosine. In short, N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is very inefficiently converted by the body to Tyrosine [R]. Even IV’ing N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine can’t elevate plasma Tyrosine levels to a significant degree, let alone via oral ingestion. Claims of increased water solubility are all marketing hype and were disproved easily by showing just how poorly N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is at converting to Tyrosine in the body.  The graph above depicts arterial concentrations of N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine (NAT) and Tyrosine (Tyr) during intravenous infusion of N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine. As you can see, Tyrosine levels barely even budge. This is the same kind of tactic used to try and market new and “improved” forms of creatine that at the end of the day do not yield any additional benefit, and just feature an inflated price tag. In our first batch of Gorilla Mind, we actually had N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine in the formulas based on these claims of improved water solubility by our manufacturer at the time. After delving into the data further, I realized the massive difference in bioavailability and swapped out the N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine for straight L-Tyrosine, found a better manufacturing facility, and all batches of Gorilla Mind products since then have featured L-Tyrosine instead. Agmatine Sulfate – 1000 mg Agmatine has shown to induce NO production more effectively than Arginine [R]. Agmatine has also shown to be neuroprotective against excitotoxicity and stroke, and also has anti-anxiety and anti-depressant effects that may enhance state of well-being and mood elevation with supplementation. Agmatine has also shown to manipulate pain receptors, which may result in an increased pain tolerance during intense training. Agmatine is a very misunderstood compound and is believed by some to antagonize other vasodilators. Agmatine works in a more selective way than other vasodilators, as it only increases one of the three Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms. It also decreases the other two NOS isoforms, which is where the hypothesis about it being vasoconstricting was raised as a concern. The three NOS isoforms include iNOS, nNOS and eNOS. They each play their own role in certain tissues to regulate vasodilation.  iNOS (inducible) produces high concentrations of NO via an immune system response to kill harmful bacteria. In excess, iNOS can be inflammatory. nNOS (neuronal) regulates neurological health and facilitates communication in the brain across neurons. In excess, nNOS can inhibit the growth and repair of neurons. eNOS (endothelial) facilitates vasodilation in the lining of blood vessels to improve blood flow.  eNOS is the main isoform that most are familiar with that increases blood flow and lowers blood pressure. It is also the main isoform that facilitates massive pumps in the gym. While NO is great for the gym and vascular health, it can be inflammatory in excess. NO production by eNOS has shown to play a protective role in cerebral ischemia by maintaining vascular permeability, whereas NO derived from nNOS and iNOS is neurotoxic and can enhance the neuronal damage occurring in ischemia [R]. This is where the selective activity of Agmatine shines, as data suggests that Agmatine's mechanism of action is facilitated by inhibiting iNOS and nNOS and increasing eNOS [R, R]. Agmatine has shown to selectively increase eNOS levels while simultaneously decreasing iNOS and MMP-9 protein expression [R, R]. Data suggests that Agmatine may also be an inhibitor of the enzyme Arginase [R]. Arginase inhibits the production of NO through several mechanisms, but mainly by competing with NO synthase (NOS) for the substrate Arginine and uncoupling of NOS [R]. Thus, the inhibition of Arginase can effectively enhance the amount of NO produced through a different vector than most NO precursors upstream.  Anecdotally, Agmatine does not seem to inhibit any of the positive effects of L-Citrulline or other vasodilators. On the contrary, it seems to complement other “pump” compounds very effectively. On paper, Agmatine sounds like the perfect ancillary compound to add to a pre-workout as it increases expression of the NOS isoform we want, while simultaneously inhibiting the isoforms that can be more inflammatory in excess. Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum) – 500 mg I’ve had a fair bit of experience with Kanna as one of my business partners Chris has had it available for sale via Happy Hippo Herbals for years now. Kanna supplementation has been found to effectively lower stress, elevate mood and increase focus. I noticed it had started to make its way into the pre-workout industry within the past year or so, and I thought it was an excellent idea to add in as a complementary cognitive aid. Kanna is not the same as Kratom, despite being commonly lumped into the same category. Kanna works mainly via increasing the amount of serotonin available in the brain, and is typically utilized for its anti-anxiety and mood elevating effects [R]. Anecdotally, a dose between 200-500 mg of Kanna has shown to be ideal for oral ingestion in a mixed drink. Higher dosages between 1-2 grams have been associated with unwanted side effects like dizziness. Kanna has no addictive properties, and it is not hallucinogenic [R, R]. One thing to keep in mind with Kanna use is that it has a high affinity for the serotonin transporter. Therefore, it is plausible that Kanna can interfere with SSRI pharmaceuticals. Caffeine Anhydrous – 350 mg Caffeine is the most well-known central nervous system stimulant on earth. Aside from the obvious cognitive benefits of Caffeine, it also has shown to increase power output and training volume, as well as lower fatigue. How Much Can Caffeine Increase Workload, Even When Sleep Deprived? In a double-blind, crossover study, 16 professional rugby players ingested either a placebo or 4 mg/kg caffeine 1 hr before exercise [R]. The effects of caffeine were assessed on well slept (8 hours or more) and sleep-deprived athletes (6 hours or less). Athletes were asked to perform as many repetitions on each set as possible without failure. Sleep deprivation produced a very large decrease in total load in the placebo group, but caffeine ingestion in the sleep deprived group was able to completely offset that loss of performance. Caffeine also resulted in a moderate increase in total load in the well slept group. Notably, Testosterone response to exercise increased with caffeine compared with placebo. Caffeine Increases Energy Expenditure (Calories Burned) Per Day Single-dose oral administration of 100 mg caffeine increased the resting metabolic rate of both lean and post-obese human volunteers by 3-4% over 150 minutes [R]. Repeated caffeine administration of 100 mg every 2 hours over a 12 hour span increased energy expenditure of both subject groups by 8-11%. The net effect was a significant increase in daily energy expenditure of 150 calories in lean volunteers and 79 calories in post-obese subjects. Commonly consumed doses of caffeine can have a significant impact on energy balance and staying lean. Stacking Caffeine With L-Theanine To Help You Get To Sleep And Smooth Out The Jitters If you get jitters even with low doses of caffeine, L-Theanine is definitely worth looking into. L-Theanine works by targeting four key neurotransmitters: GABA, Serotonin, Dopamine, and Norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters are responsible for feelings of attention, stress, arousal, and pleasure. By mitigating the over-activity of neurons, L-Theanine helps to calm down the brain, reduce stress, and get rid of anxiety. This is why L-Theanine complements stimulants like caffeine so well, as it takes the edge off of stimulants that can cause jitters and over-stimulation in some individuals. One notable rodent model even showed that L-theanine can partially counteract caffeine-induced sleep disturbances [R]. L-Theanine can also significantly improve memory, focus and attention to detail [R]. Stacking Gorilla Mind Smooth with Gorilla Mode will provide you with a large dose of L-Theanine that will take the edge off of the stims in the pre-workout if you are very stimulant sensitive. Caffeine Dosage In general, healthy adults can safely consume up to 400 mg of caffeine per day [R]. However, that doesn’t mean that you should use that high of a dosage. Use caffeine as needed relative to your individual tolerance. For some, starting with as low as half a scoop of Gorilla Mode (87.5 mg caffeine) may be more than enough to achieve topped out cognitive stimulation without getting jitters and other caffeine induced side effects. For those with a much higher caffeine tolerance, the maximum daily dose of Gorilla Mode includes 350 mg of caffeine. If that isn’t enough caffeine for you to feel it pre-workout, you probably need to cycle off of stimulants for a week or two. N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate – 350 mg Phenylethylamine (PEA) is popularly known as the “love drug” in the brain. PEA increases the release of serotonin, adrenaline, dopamine, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). These neurotransmitters can significantly impact cognitive function, state of well-being, energy levels and overall mood [R, R]. PEA is called the love drug because it promotes the same feelings of infatuation experienced during the early phases of love. Exhilarating things like skydiving, using certain psychoactive drugs, and eating large amounts of chocolate also raise PEA levels. Orally ingested PEA only has a half-life of 5-10 minutes, which is why it is nearly useless in most supplements. This is because Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) quickly breaks it down. MAO is an enzyme in the body that breaks down PEA, dopamine, as well as other neurotransmitters. This is why effective PEA based products almost always feature some sort of MAO inhibitor. By using MAO inhibitors like Hordenine with PEA, you can effectively prevent MAO from breaking down PEA as quickly, consequently allowing PEA to exert its full effects in the body and significantly increasing its active life. The PEA + Hordenine stack is one of the components of the Gorilla Mind Smooth formula. I wanted to go in another direction with this pre-workout formula and include a compound that is harder hitting, as the effects of the PEA and Hordenine combo are a bit subtle for a pre-workout, hence why it is in our Smooth (less aggressive) Nootropic formula. This is why I decided to include a very high dose of N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate in Gorilla Mode. N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate mimics the actions of adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin and keeps levels elevated throughout the duration of a full workout. The reason it lasts longer than PEA is that it has 2 methyl groups connected to the Nitrogen in the molecule, which acts as a safeguard to prevent it from being broken down by MAO as quickly as PEA, and doesn’t require a MAO inhibitor to be stacked with it to last throughout a workout. This is the chemical structure of Phenylethylamine (PEA).  The nitrogen atom in PEA is known as the amine, and needs to be protected from MAO in order to prolong its effects in the brain. As you can see, there is nothing attached to the Nitrogen atom to protect it from being cleaved by the MAO enzyme. This is the chemical structure of N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate.  The 2 methyl groups attached to the Nitrogen atom prevent MAO from cleaving the amine as quickly, consequently increasing the duration of its cognitive enhancing effects for the majority of your workout. In conjunction with the 350 mg dose of caffeine, the high dose of N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate in this formula can significantly increase focus, intensity, energy levels, and overall performance. BioPerine® (Black Pepper Fruit Extract) (standardized to 95% Piperine) – 10 mg Bioperine is a trademarked form of black pepper extract standardized to 95% Piperine. Black pepper extract is a very effective CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor [R]. These enzymes break down molecules like caffeine and noradrenaline in the body. By prolonging the breakdown of the cognitive enhancing ingredients in this formula, Bioperine extends how long they work for, and can also significantly increase their bioavailability. Basically, Bioperine makes the stimulants hit harder and last longer. In addition, Bioperine has MAO inhibiting properties, thus further potentiating the effects of N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate. Huperzine A – 400 mcg Huperzine A works by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase in the brain, which is an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is not only a major regulator of cognitive performance, but it is also an important neurotransmitter needed for optimal muscular contractions during exercise. Huperzine A has shown to promote neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons in the brain) and act as a neuroprotective agent for existing neurons in the brain. In turn, Huperzine A has shown to enhance memory, focus and overall cognitive function [R, R]. Huperzine A is one of the most potent Nootropics that you can really “feel” and it complements the other stimulants and Nootropics in this formula perfectly. Ingredients I Didn’t Include In The Formula And Why Beta Alanine Beta Alanine is the ingredient that makes your skin itchy and has you sitting there scratching your face between sets. I assume it is included in pre-workouts because you can blatantly feel something when you take it, so people associate feeling something with the product being potent. Personally, I can’t stand the itchy skin effect it has, and it can be bad enough that it ruins a pre-workout just based on that. In addition, it doesn’t have more than a negligible effect on performance at best. Acute sporadic bumps in Beta Alanine will do next to nothing if you are only getting your Beta Alanine dosage from your pre workout supplement a few times per week. If you were to take it correctly, dosing it multiple times per day, for weeks on end, at a high enough dosage, the impact on performance is notable, although still fairly insignificant at the end of the day. “The median effect of β-alanine supplementation is a 2.85% (-0.37 to 10.49%) improvement in the outcome of an exercise measure, when a median total of 179 g of β-alanine is supplemented” [R]. 179 grams (an amount nobody would end up getting in) for a 2.85% improvement in performance, and a ton of itchiness… “Although some laboratory-based studies show an ergogenic effect with beta-alanine supplementation, there is a lack of field-based research in training and competition settings.”  “There was an unclear effect (0.4%; ± 0.8%, mean, ± 90% confidence limits) of beta-alanine on competition performance compared to placebo with no meaningful changes in blood chemistry. While there was a transient improvement on training performance after 4 weeks with beta-alanine (-1.3%; ± 1.0%), there was an unclear effect at ten weeks (-0.2%; ± 1.5%) and no meaningful changes in blood chemistry. Beta-alanine supplementation appears to have minimal effect on swimming performance in non-laboratory controlled real-world training and competition settings” [R]. Leucine Taking Leucine post-workout promotes muscle growth. However, taking Leucine in your pre-workout has shown to diminish muscular performance via the inhibition of glycogen to glucose conversion within muscle cells and insulin signaling. On top of that, Leucine can prevent the uptake of Tyrosine into the brain, consequently inhibiting dopamine production, which is the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish via our cognitive enhancing Nootropics. Antioxidants/Vitamins One of the worst things you can do is take antioxidants before your workout. The stress and damage induced by weightlifting or exercise is needed to facilitate muscular recovery and progress. The reactive oxygen species produced during intense training assists with that process, and is also why drugs like Ibuprofen can inhibit muscle growth so severely. The inflammatory response to training is what we want in order to recover, and by inhibiting that with antioxidants or anti-inflammatory drugs, you prevent your body from breaking down and recovering the way it needs to in order to grow. A pre-workout formula with a bunch of vitamins in it is more likely to hinder your gains than help. Sodium Sodium is one of the most critical and overlooked components of a diet designed to optimize exercise performance. But, keep in mind, you’re not going to get enough sodium in a pre-workout without it tasting terrible, and I wouldn’t insult your intelligence by putting a suboptimal amount in this pre-workout. Toss and wash a half-teaspoon of salt pre-workout alongside Gorilla Mode, and another half teaspoon post-workout. If I ever put out a product with sodium in it, it will be in a high enough dose to actually be beneficial for you, and it will very negatively impact the taste of the product. But, I will be transparent about why my product tastes like sh*t, unlike other companies who will put a tiny dose of sodium in their product and then claim you will get all of the benefits of it. Yohimbine And Rauwolscine Both of these stimulants are great fat burning agents, and you can definitely feel them hit hard. But, the way they hit doesn’t feel good at all in my opinion, and both of these stimulants can easily ruin an otherwise good pre-workout formula. Every time I take Yohimbine or Rauwolscine, I feel like I’m hypoglycemic mid-workout, and it actually negatively impacts my performance. The only time I’ll use Yohimbine or Rauwolscine is on their own fasted before low intensity cardio. Pre-workout I steer clear of these ingredients. L-Carnitine Oral L-Carnitine is useless. It is not bioavailable, and using it orally is a waste of money in my opinion [R]. Isopropylnorsynephrine This is a newer stimulant that hits hard. The problem is that it feels like you’re going to have a heart attack whenever you use it. Even at moderate doses, Isopropylnorsynephrine literally just jacks my heart rate through the roof to the point where I’m actually worried, and it doesn’t improve my focus or energy very much at all. Should You Ever Cycle Off Of Gorilla Mode? I advise that you always cycle off of stimulant based products for at least 5-7 days straight every month. During this time, you can use Nootropics (or a stimulant-free Nootropic formula) to support enhanced cognitive function in the absence of your standard stimulant cocktail. How To Combine Gorilla Mode With Gorilla Mind Rush If you use the maximum daily dose of Gorilla Mind Rush or Gorilla Mode on any given day, do not use the other product at all. However, the formulas are designed in a way that you can stack them together if you wish for an enhanced level of focus. The only way you can do that though is if you keep your total daily dosage no higher than what would equate to the max total daily stimulant dosage provided by either product. To simplify things, in terms of a stimulant strength context, treat 3 capsules of Gorilla Mind Rush like 1 scoop of Gorilla Mode. If you can handle 6 capsules of Gorilla Mind Rush or 2 scoops of Gorilla Mode, on days where you want to combine them, you can use 3 capsules of Gorilla Mind Rush with 1 scoop of Gorilla Mode. Or, 1.5 scoops of Gorilla Mode with 1-2 capsules of Gorilla Mind Rush. Or, a half scoop of Gorilla Mode with 4-5 capsules of Gorilla Mind Rush. And so on. In general, look at the caffeine content of the amount of Gorilla Mind Rush you want to use, and the caffeine content of the amount of Gorilla Mode you want to use, and ensure that your total combined dosage does not exceed 350 mg per day, regardless of how you combine them together. The combination of stimulants in Gorilla Mind Rush results in a bit more tunnel vision-like focus, but can be more vasoconstrictive than the stimulants in Gorilla Mode. So, if you are willing to compromise a little bit of pump in order to mix Rush with Mode to get a deeper level of laser focus, then by all means you can do that as long as you don’t exceed a total combined dosage of over 350 mg of caffeine per day between the two products. Conclusion – What To Expect From Gorilla Mode In general, you can expect a massive increase in nitric oxide (NO) levels, intramuscular hydration, energy, focus and as significant of a boost in muscle strength and endurance as you can get from a legal non-hormonal pre-workout. This product is maxed out in the pump and performance category, as well as in the cognitive enhancing category. It has a massive dose of L-Citrulline, GlycerPump, Agmatine, Creatine and Betaine to saturate your muscles with blood and intracellular hydration. It also has a potent stimulant complex comprised of a high dose of Caffeine and N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate. The high dosed Nootropics L-Tyrosine, Kanna and Huperzine A top off the cognitive enhancing component of Gorilla Mode and contribute to a significant increase in energy, focus and overall mental sharpness. Try Gorilla Mode for yourself here and let me know what you think.

Table of Contents ToggleAndrogen Receptor Density In The DeltsMy Training Approach For Building 3D DeltsHow Important Is Mind-Muscle Connection For Deltoid Development?Should You Have A Dedicated Shoulder Workout Each Week?Neglecting Rear Delts Results In Subpar GrowthWhat It Comes Down ToRelated Androgen Receptor Density In The Delts Obviously, the first thing all the trolls will do is jump to the comments section and say something like “Trenbolone. That's all there is to it, it's the TREN!” I'm not going to argue with the fact that androgen response is largely going to dictate whether or not you build ridiculously developed delts. There is a popular hypothesis in the community that is often thrown around as fact that there is a greater density of androgen receptors in the delts than other muscle groups. I've seen the science backing that up in in the traps. However, I have yet to see definitive evidence proving this in the delts as well. The only evidence I could find showing increased AR density in a specific body part was the following study that found that AR-containing myonuclei per fibre cross-section was higher in the trapezius [R].  Apparently, the study only compared the human vastus lateralis and trapezius muscles, so it is not disqualifying the possibility that there is an increased density in the delts as well, but I haven't seen a study yet that explicitly states it as fact either. Even if a study doesn't exist, I think we can make an educated guess based on anecdotal logs and basic observation that there probably is greater density in the shoulders as well. No sh*t right, of course steroids will help you grow muscle, thanks Sherlock. Yes, we obviously all know that, but in regard to the literal 3D look of the muscle itself, it does appear as though enhanced individuals do have favorable growth in their delts relative to a natural athlete with the same amount of lean body mass on their frame. In other words, in general (not applicable every time obviously) a natural athlete who is 200 pounds lean will have less developed delts than a guy on steroids who is also 200 pounds lean. Does that mean that you should hop on the sauzule if you want 3D delts? No, of course not, I'm just trying to be transparent in elaborating on exactly what I think led to my development.                View this post on Instagram                      @chrisdelia our shoulders should collab #baboom A post shared by @ moreplates_moredates on May 25, 2019 at 8:01am PDT   \n\n My Training Approach For Building 3D Delts One of the most common training mistakes I see that limits growth is adhering too strictly to either strength focused training, or high rep volume training. At the end of the day, progressive overload and keeping a detailed logbook or app to record your sets, reps and weights is the thing that will make or break your progress. However, focusing too heavily on low rep strength training with compound movements, or focusing too heavily on getting a pump with lower weight high rep volume/isolation work, can limit progression for many individuals. Typically, my shoulder day would start with a heavy compound movement like a seated barbell shoulder press, dumbbell shoulder press, or a standing military press.  The anterior head of the delt I feel gets adequate stimulation during presses on chest day, so I would usually only do 1 exercise for the front delt during my shoulder workouts. Afterwards, I would move onto some sort of lateral movement. I like to work from the front to the back for delt training. The exercise I noticed the most development from was dumbbell lateral raises.  After hitting failure on my last set of the exercise, I would follow up with a drop set, or surf the rack. Surfing the rack is something you can do after you hit failure on your last set of dumbbell lateral raises where you literally “surf” the rack and use a lower weight and burn the muscle out to failure progressively until you are literally all way down to the 5-10 pound dumbbells and repping them out until failure. For example, if my last set I hit failure using 35 pound dumbbells, I would then go grab 30's and rep them out until failure. Then I would go down to 25's and rep them out until failure. And then 20's. Then 15's. And so on until you're down to the lightest weight. Surfing the rack works well with other body parts too. I got the idea from Rob Riches back when I was in high school and first started working out.  It's a great finisher exercise where you can drive an insane amount of blood into the muscle and focus on maximizing hypertrophy after finishing your heavy working sets. After dumbbell lateral raises, I would hit a cable lateral movement, or a more isolated movement for the lateral head of the delt. Finally, I would move on to the rear delts with cable face pulls, or a makeshift isolated rowing movement focused on the contraction of the rear delt rather than the back.   I also like reverse fly movements, although they are arguably less effective. At the end of the day, my shoulder workouts essentially comprised of some heavy compound work, heavy laterals, progressive overload, and driving as much blood as possible into each head of the delt. When I was building my physique up, my shoulder workouts took no more than an hour, and I felt were more than sufficient for gaining strength and size. There is definitely something to be said about ensuring your workouts aren't too one dimensional and entirely strength or pump focused. Check off all the boxes before you leave the gym every workout to ensure you maximize your growth opportunities both in strength and in an isolation work/pump context is what I suggest. If you check off all the boxes before you leave the gym, you know you left no stone unturned and will maximize your opportunity to grow. I progressed the most once I stopped focusing entirely on just increasing my compound movement numbers and also started focusing on really stretching, contracting and driving blood into the muscle each workout. How Important Is Mind-Muscle Connection For Deltoid Development? Once you leave your ego at the door, that's when you will really maximize your opportunity to grow. I used to move weight for the sake of moving it. I wanted a strong bench press, squat and deadlift, and I achieved that within a couple years. However, I wasn't growing nearly as much as I should have been based on my numbers, and this was largely due to the lack of mind-muscle connection. Once I dropped my weights by 50% and started working my way back up, that's when I started really progressing in a size context. 2 years into lifting I had worked my way up to a 5 and a half plate deadlift for a few reps, but my back barely looked like I lifted. After leaving my ego at the door and dropping down to a 3 plate deadlift, I started progressing MUCH faster, because I could actually slow down and focus on stretching and contracting on each rep. There's a huge difference between form that looks good, and actually feeling what you're doing. This sounds counter intuitive because you would assume that if your form looks good, then you would be maximizing your outcomes in a hypertrophy context. This is not the case though in my experience. Even once you get down to a reasonable weight, if you aren't really focusing on the eccentric stretch, and the concentric contraction with each rep, you will not get as much out of the movement, and this will be blatantly obvious by the lack of sufficient blood flow. I can do a curl that looks almost exactly the same, with the exact same weight, in a way that will elicit more growth than me simply moving the weight up and down simply by focusing on the stretch and contraction. This is what mind-muscle connection boils down to. I can do a barbell row where the top of the rep I either contract hard, or I simply drop back down into my next rep. To the untrained eye, the rep would look almost exactly the same, both performed with good form, however, the difference between actually achieving an adequate stretch and a hard contraction at the top of each rep is night and day in a hypertrophy context. If you can't feel the stretch and contraction, you are probably using too heavy of a weight. Once I dropped my weights down by 50%, I noticed that I was actually starting to get a good pump every workout. Something that was almost completely absent from my workouts prior where I was just focused on getting the weight from point A to point B with reasonable form. Don't be in the gym for the sake of being there to move sh*t around. If you aren't fully stretching the muscle at the bottom of each rep, and contracting hard at the top of each rep, you are either using too heavy of a weight, or selling yourself short on each rep. I believe this is partially why powerlifters don't have the same muscular development as bodybuilders, despite being way stronger. A powerlifter's goal is getting the weight from point A to point B without getting injured, whereas a bodybuilder's goal is to make the weight feel as heavy as possible and elicit as much of a growth response as possible. Should You Have A Dedicated Shoulder Workout Each Week? If delts are a lagging body part for you, then it would be a good idea to have a dedicated shoulder workout each week. I would even advise hitting a pump focused lateral movement and rear movement at the end of each chest day too. However, this only applies if they are genetically lagging. If they respond well to training (and AAS if applicable), then hitting them after your chest movements should be sufficient. With that being said, I always had a dedicated shoulder day and they clearly weren't a genetic weak point for me. I probably didn't need one, and I would have a more balanced physique now if I had trained them less. However, if that is a look that you are chasing, then by all means I would definitely advise having a dedicated shoulder workout each week. Neglecting Rear Delts Results In Subpar Growth One of the biggest mistakes is neglecting the rear delts. There are three heads of the delt. The front, the side, and the rear. The problem is that most guys will just focus on heavy presses and lateral raises, and then completely overlook the fact that they will not get complete looking 3D delts without sufficiently hitting the rear head as well.

What It Comes Down To As I mentioned previously, androgen response is going to be a big factor that determines what your delts look like. I don't see natural athletes who have crazy delts very often. With that being said, I don't see a lot of guys on gear with insane capped 3D delts either. Expectedly, there are more of them proportionally relative to naturals though. Everyone has their gifted body parts. When it comes to delts in particular, I do believe it largely boils down to genetic muscle inserts and androgen response (keep in mind, that can include endogenous androgen response too). The principles I outlined above are exactly what I used in conjunction with exogenous androgens to build up my physique and can be implemented with or without androgens to get your closer to your goals too.

    "content": "Why Your Hair Loss Prevention Topicals Might Not Be Working | Scalp Caked With Sebum     Exfoliating the sebum off your scalp is just as important as exfoliating the gunk off your face. Some individuals have so much sebum built up on their scalp that it prevents their topical hair loss treatments from being absorbed properly. When it comes to topical antiandrogens, topical PGD2 inhibitors, growth agonists like Minoxidil, or anything that requires some sort of delivery system, if there is something sitting on your scalp like sebum or dandruff, you may not even be absorbing your topicals properly and getting them delivered where they need to go. If you take something orally, it's not rocket science, everyone's capable of popping the same pill. But, when it comes to topical application, there are some factors that come into play that are often overlooked. One of them is the porosity of your scalp tissue itself. In addition to that, general gunk and sebum buildup. Sebum is something that most people are not removing from their scalp effectively. If you have a layer of crap sitting on your scalp, whatever you put on your head for hair loss prevention is probably not going to get where it needs to go to work properly. This is why I recommend exfoliating your scalp once per week with a fine sea salt scrub.  How To Exfoliate Sebum Off Your Scalp The sea salt scrub acts as an effective exfoliator. When you are in the shower, all you need to do is pour enough into your hand to get full coverage of the top of your wet scalp, and then massage/exfoliate the sea salt over your scalp to peel the sebum, dead skin, and other accumulated gunk off your scalp. Sometimes, the difference between a topical treatment working or not comes down to application technique, the vehicle being used, or sebum build up not being accounted for. Clean your scalp properly to maximize the absorption of your topicals. Which Sea Salt To Get? I advise getting a fine sea salt for your scrub. I use Morton Fine Mediterranean Salt, but it doesn't really make a difference which fine sea salt you get.  Don't get a grainy sea salt, as it may damage your skin.

    "date": "2019-10-20T22:14:40+00:00",
    "content": "CB-03-01 Review (Breezula) | Is It The Cure For Hair Loss?     I finally got around to trying CB-03-01. I had heard varying opinions on its therapeutic promise in the community, but at the end of the day I had to do a CB-03-01 review myself to see if this compound is superior to other alternatives we already have at our disposal. Breezula (developmental code name CB-03-01) is a synthetic steroidal antiandrogen being developed as a potential treatment for androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness). CB-03-01 is probably going to be the first topical antiandrogen that actually gets approved for human use as a hair loss prevention treatment. The first thing that should be stressed when it comes to something like this is that regrowth will not be common with its use. Prevention is the goal with something like this. The clinical data on CB-03-01 isn't overly impressive in terms of hair loss prevention and reversal. The main issue with treatment options like this are expectations. You should lower your expectations when it comes to topical antiandrogens. Preventing further loss is the goal, and any regrowth is a fringe benefit. Having something with a high level of tolerability, low side effect profile, and can also effectively compete at the androgen receptor locally with ALL endogenous androgens, can be a critical component of a comprehensive hair loss prevention protocol. CB-03-01 doesn't inhibit DHT systemically like Finasteride or Dutasteride, it leaves endogenous androgen levels in tact, but competes locally at the androgen receptor.

RU58841My CB-03-01 ReviewWhere To Buy CB-03-01Related RU58841 Vs. CB-03-01 Results – In My Experience Having years of experience under my belt with RU58841 and other topical compounds, I felt like I had a good reference point to judge the overall efficacy of CB-03-01. For me personally, CB-03-01 didn't cause any side effects, and neither has RU58841. How effective was it as a topical antiandrogen? Mild in my opinion, but still promising. RU58841 seems stronger to me, however, that doesn't mean that something with a lower potency milligram for milligram can't just be dosed higher to yield a similar outcome. The issue with that is that CB-03-01 is extremely cost prohibitive right now. A minority of individuals have found CB-03-01 to be more tolerable than RU58841 with a formidable antiandrogen effect. However, the majority of individuals, myself included, have not found it to be on par with RU58841, and it is far more expensive. CB-03-01 Vs. Other Topical AntiAndrogens If a very high dose of CB-03-01 was the same price as a moderate dose of RU58841, then I believe that would then potentially justify it as the superior alternative, but as of now it seems that there are more cost effective alternatives to CB-03-01 that are also just as effective, if not more effective. And that's just comparing CB-03-01 to what is viewed in our community as the most traditional antiandrogen. I believe there are other topical androgen receptor agonists and antagonists that could also have more therapeutic promise than both. For example, the molecular weight of certain Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators are low enough to work topically (in theory). I've elaborated on the therapeutic promise of SARMs in a hair loss prevention context before, and I have already seen this in real life application. The binding affinity of most SARMs are also significantly better than CB-03-01. With all that being said CB-03-01 is the only topical antiandrogen that is currently being developed for hair loss prevention and has a growing amount of safety data for us to refer to. For most people, the obvious choice of which topical treatment to use would be the one with the most safety data on it. Based on what I've seen, CB-03-01 may be moderately effective for some individuals at holding their ground. And realistically, you can't really expect a whole lot more than that from a topical antiandrogen that doesn't affect the endogenous hormone profile at all. This is the kind of thing you would start taking before you notice hair loss to maintain, not something you would implement once you've receded several Norwoods and have severe diffuse thinning. Deploying CB-03-01 before hair loss gets too severe may be sufficient in maintaining perfect hair with minimal side effects for years, if not decades. A proactive approach needs to be taken to hair loss prevention, not a reactive approach once you've already experienced significant amounts of miniaturization. Using this as a reactive approach to make up lost ground will likely yield less than satisfactory results because it is a prevention/maintenance drug. Facilitating significant regrowth would require more intensive protocols with less favorable side effect profiles. CB-03-01 Limitations Price Price is one CB's of the biggest limitations right now. There are very few companies selling it, and the ones that are have it priced several times higher than alternatives that are just as effective. In addition, CB-03-01 requires an even higher daily dosage than the cost-effective alternatives, making it even more cost prohibitive. The results of the human trials have shown that a minimum of a 7.5% strength solution would be needed, and it may even need to be applied twice per day to achieve sufficient maintenance. That's 150 – 450 mg of CB-03-01 per day just to potentially achieve maintenance (depending on how much solution you need to use to get full scalp coverage with each application). You could easily end up spending over $100 – $300 per week just to use the minimum effective dosage of CB-03-01, and still be underwhelmed with your results. With that being said, once Breezula is available as an FDA approved treatment, perhaps the price will become less of a concern, but as of now it is just too cost prohibitive for most of us at the dosage needed to yield sufficient hair loss prevention. Potency Preventing loss is what should be expected of an effective antiandrogen. It seems like in less aggressive cases CB-03-01 is mildly effective in doing that. For many individuals though, it is not turnkey monotherapy option. Does that mean its useless? No, not at all. It is definitely a better line of defense than nothing, that's for sure. For individuals with more aggressive loss who have implemented CB-03-01 with subpar results, they would likely need to add other compounds into their protocol. Complementary compounds to CB-03-01 for a more comprehensive protocol may include things like 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, PGD2 inhibitors, PGE2 agonists, potassium channel openers, Non-Steroidal SARMs, Steroidal SARMs, antiandrogens, other bioidentical sex hormones, etc. The most obvious first choices for most individuals being Finasteride, Minoxidil and a Ketoconazole shampoo. CB-03-01 (or another formidable topical antiandrogen) used in conjunction with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, Minoxidil and a Ketoconazole shampoo will be effective in staving off hair loss for decades for many individuals. Is it the most effective option? No, however, it is tried and true and has a fairly predictable side effect profile with lots of human clinical and anecdotal data to refer to. Keep in mind, treatment options can have a compounding effect in protection, and there can be many pathways to address. For example, if you are just using Finasteride to inhibit 5-alpha reductase, sure you will knock out a fair chunk of your systemic and scalp DHT, but what are you doing to protect you from the rest of the unaddressed DHT? And what are you doing to address the massive spike in scalp Testosterone that comes along with inhibiting the 5-alpha reduction of Testosterone into DHT? Despite many treatment options being marketed as “treatments”, the reality is that most of them just address one pathway in the body, and can even precipitate other issues that then need to be addressed with adjunct treatments. Remember, DHT isn't the only androgen in the body that causes hair loss. This is why topical antiandrogens have such therapeutic promise. Clinical Trial Results Cassiopea recently published the results of their 12 month clinical trial [R]: Six Month Interim Analysis Efficacy Results    Primary Endpoints at 6 months (interim analysis on 375 subjects) Clascoterone 2.5% BID Clascoterone 5% BID Clascoterone 7.5% BID Clascoterone 7.5% QD Vehicle   Mean changes from baseline TAHC  13.0134  12.2109  20.7879  11.5182  -0.1114    P value (vs. baseline)  < 0.0001  < 0.0001  < 0.0001  < 0.0001  0.9660    P value (vs. vehicle)  0.0003  0.0010  < 0.0001  0.0017  —    Favorable HGA (+1, +2, +3)  56%  58%  62%  61%  49%    As you can see, favorable hair growth assessment (HGA) improved in all CB-03-01 treated groups compared to the vehicle treated group. With a lack of side effects and a high level of tolerability, CB-03-01 looked very promising at the six month mark. However, the twelve month mark showed less encouraging results. Twelve Month Analysis Efficacy Results    TAHC Per Protocol (344 subjects) At 12 months  Clascoterone 2.5% BID  Clascoterone 5% BID  Clascoterone 7.5% BID  Clascoterone 7.5% QD    Mean changes from vehicle TAHC (n.)  10.2  13.8  14.3  12.7    P value (vs. vehicle)  0.0087  0.0006  0.0003  0.0016       HGA Per Protocol (344 subjects)  Clascoterone 2.5% BID  Clascoterone 5% BID  Clascoterone 7.5% BID  Clascoterone 7.5% QD  Vehicle    At 12 months          Favorable HGA (+1, +2, +3)  60.8%  60.0%  61.8%  56.1%  50.0%       TAHW Per Protocol (344 subjects)    At 12 months  Clascoterone 2.5% BID  Clascoterone 5% BID  Clascoterone 7.5% BID  Clascoterone 7.5% QD    Mean changes from vehicle TAHW (µm)  521.1  615.0  762.5  658.8    P value (vs. vehicle)  0.0105  0.0034  0.0003  0.0018    As you can see, the vehicle increased from 49% > 50% favorable HGA at 12 months, whereas 12 months using the highest dosage of CB-03-01 once per day caused a 4.9% drop in favorable HGA. That means that the group who was not treated with anything were perceived to have better results than the group that was using a high dose of CB-03-01 once per day by the twelve month mark. Now, keep in mind that favorable HGA only represents the opinion of the patient on hair growth, expressed with a questionnaire. It is subjective, but at the end of the day, it is not rocket science to look at before and after pictures of your hair and see if you are happy with your progress or not. Also, this is only one dosage arm, but still, it's not overly promising, unfortunately. Twice per day dosing of the highest CB-03-01 concentration dropped 0.2% by the twelve month mark, which could be argued to be representative of maintenance, but with how expensive this stuff is (as of now) using a 7.5% strength solution twice per day is not really realistic, let alone once per day. With all that being said, even if maintenance is achieved with a complete absence of side effects, that would be considered a win for a topical antiandrogen candidate. Binding Affinity Of CB-03-01 Vs. RU58841 CB-03-01 binds to the androgen receptor with approximately 100-fold lower affinity than DHT [R]. A common feature of pure antiandrogens, such as Hydroxyflutamide and Casodex, is their relatively weak binding affinity for the androgen receptor, 50–100 times less than that of Testosterone. However, RU58841 binds to the androgen receptor with an equivalent affinity to Testosterone (ka = 1.1 nM) [R]. DHT has a binding affinity of 0.25-0.5 nM for the human AR, which is about 2-3 times higher than that of Testosterone [R]. By extension, we can estimate that CB-03-01 binds to the androgen receptor with approximately 40-fold lower affinity than Testosterone. Consequently, we can assume that RU58841 has a binding affinity 40 times higher than CB-03-01. Topical RU58841 also showed no detectable abnormalities in body weight, hematology, and blood chemistry tests, serum levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and luteinizing hormone during examination [R].   My CB-03-01 Review At the end of the day, I do believe that CB-03-01 is promising, however, I do not believe that it is going to be a turnkey monotherapy solution that is effective in staving off hair loss in anyone with even moderately aggressive androgenic alopecia. I also believe that there are more cost-effective alternatives that already exist that are also more effective at preventing hair loss. With that being said, we still have to see if further research in the future reveals more promising data and if it becomes less cost prohibitive. As of now though, I do not think that it is better than alternatives that are already available to us. Where To Buy CB-03-01 Most CB-03-01 sources do not third party test their products, nor do they have any satisfactory level of quality control whatsoever. I strongly advise that before you buy CB-03-01 from a company online you thoroughly evaluate their track record, their third party test results, and how they are marketing their products in general.

    "content": "The Reported Side Effects Of SARMs In Human Trials     In general, there are two camps of individuals who have polar opposite views on the promise of SARMs. One camp views them as weak alternatives to Steroids with just as many side effects. The other camp hypes SARMs up as compounds that are nearly as effective (or just as effective) as Steroids, but with far less severe side effects. There are very few individuals who can not only acknowledge the shortcomings of the current SARMs in development, but also open their mind up to the blatant therapeutic promise of these anabolic agents. Of all of the SARMs that have been discovered to date, there are a handful that have been tested on humans in clinical trials. These SARMs include Ostarine, LGD-4033, GSK2881078 and PF-06260414. Contrary to popular belief, there were in fact reported side effects of SARMs in human trials. I elaborated on these in detail in the article “Are SARMs Side Effect-Free?“.

    "content": "How To Test If Your Hair Loss Is Male Pattern Baldness Or Telogen Effluvium     This article will detail a quick and easy way to determine whether or not you are experiencing male pattern baldness or telogen effluvium (temporary shedding). If you've seen my other posts discussing hair loss, you probably already know that there is a difference between follicular miniaturization triggered by androgens, and shedding triggered by nutritional deficiencies, hormonal fluctuations, environmental factors, toxins, allergens, hypothyroidism, radiation therapy, and other stressors. Telogen effluvium is more or less just temporary shedding induced by some sort of stress on the body. These stressors can force your hair into the shedding phase quicker than they would otherwise. Once that stressor is removed, the hair life cycle returns to normal. I'm sure you've heard of people losing their hair during stressful times like final exams. That's a perfect example of telogen effluvium. There's a big difference between hair follicles being deprived of adequate circulation (a consequence of the cascade of events triggered by androgens) and a hair prematurely falling out of your head due to some form of stress.  How To Distinguish Androgenetic Alopecia and Chronic Telogen Effluvium This is a good study to reference: “Distinguishing Androgenetic Alopecia from Chronic Telogen Effluvium When Associated in the Same Patient” [R]. While you can do this test in your sink, I would recommend getting a hair catcher to gauge your progress moving forward. When evaluating if a treatment is efficacious or not for you, having a reference of your baseline shedding levels before and after starting treatments will be very useful. When determining if a hair is miniaturized or not, it more or less breaks down to the length of the hair. Hairs that are 5 centimeters or longer are considered healthy, non-miniaturized hairs, at least as that is the standard outlined in the clinical study linked above. Hairs that are 3 centimeters or less are considered miniaturized hairs. Patients who had alopecia areata, scarring alopecias, or had very short clipped hair were excluded of course. If your hair isn't 3 cm to begin with, obviously this test will be useless for you. When patients appear to have male pattern baldness, they shed shorter and thinner telogen hairs as a result of androgen induced miniaturization. When hairs are 3 cm or shorter, they are called vellus hairs. Hair diameter was determined to be an irrelevant metric to look at because diameter and length proved to vary in parallel. The shorter the hair, the thinner it was too, so measuring the length proved to be all that was necessary to make a diagnosis. As concluded by the study, counting the telogen hairs shed during a standardized shampooing and measuring the number of those hairs that are 3 cm or shorter is good tool to diagnose type and severity of hair loss, and this number may serve as a diagnostic tool for male pattern baldness/androgenic alopecia and chronic telogen effluvium. To do this test yourself, all you need to do is collect the hair you shed during your shower and then count how many there are, and measure the length of them. If less than 10% of your shed hairs are 3 centimeters or less, according to this study, you can then conclude that you aren't experiencing androgenic alopecia If 10% or more of the hairs you shed are miniaturized (3 centimeters or less in length), then you can conclude that you are experiencing male pattern baldness. If you shed more than 100 hairs per shower, you are also experiencing telogen effluvium, and if you shed less than 100 hairs per shower, you aren't. For example:  You shower and lose 150 hairs – 20 hairs (13.3% of the total) are 3 cm or less = Androgenic Alopecia AND Telogen Effluvium You shower and lose 80 hairs – 20 hairs (25% of the total) are 3 cm or less = Androgenic Alopecia You shower and lose 150 hairs – 10 hairs (6.67% of the total) are 3 cm or less = Telogen Effluvium You shower and lose 80 hairs – 6 hairs (7.5% of the total) are 3 cm or less = No Androgenic Alopecia Or Telogen Effluvium  So, the goal is to shed less than 100 hairs per shower, and also have less than 10% of those shed hairs be 3 cm or less in length. The less miniaturized hairs you shed the better. Obviously this is a very crude way to assess if you are experiencing male pattern baldness or telogen effluvium, but it is interesting nonetheless and can give you a good baseline metric to reference as you start implementing hair loss prevention protocols. Telogen Effluvium Among Males and Females Even if 9% of the hairs you shed are miniaturized, if you're a male, I think it's still safer to assume that you're likely experiencing androgenic alopecia regardless. In my experience, most cases of chronic telogen effluvium are women, and most the overwhelming majority of cases of hair loss among men are male pattern baldness. How many elderly men have you seen have that have teenage-like hair density with a Norwood 0 hair line? I'd bet the answer is none, or very close to none relative to the amount of hairlines you've seen over your lifetime. When it comes to men, the likelihood is very high that you're experiencing androgenic alopecia to some degree. But, it's still interesting nonetheless to assess, especially if you're experiencing a massive shed. The Benchmarks If fewer than 10% of the hairs you shed are 3 centimeters or shorter, and you shed at least 100 hairs during a shower, you likely have telogen effluvium. If fewer than 10% of the hairs you shed are 3 centimeters or shorter, and you shed less than 100 hairs during a shower, you likely don't have either male pattern baldness or telogen effluvium.  If 10% or more of the hairs you shed are 3 centimeters or shorter, and you shed at least 100 hairs during a shower, you likely have male pattern baldness and telogen effluvium. If 10% or more of the hairs you shed are 3 centimeters or shorter, and you shed less than 100 hairs during a shower, you likely have male pattern baldness. This method of assessment is simple, non-invasive and suitable for office evaluation.

    "content": "How To Get More Vascular – Practical Tips To Make The Veins In Your Arms POP     There are a handful of strategies that can be implemented to get more vascular via significantly increasing nitric oxide, vasodilation, blood flow and muscle detail. How do you get your bicep vein to really pop? How do you force your veins against the surface of the skin and get that paper-thin skin look? I'm going to detail the basics of what you need to know in this article, as well as some very effective compounds that can be used to induce skin splitting pumps and vascularity.

The lower your body fat is, the closer to the surface and more visible your veins are going to be. It isn't because your veins are any different; you just have less fat shrouding them once you get lean. This is the most obvious one, but it is easily the most effective. Get lean, and stay lean if you want to look more vascular year-round. Get Rid Of Your Body Hair To Instantly Look More Vascular Most guys don't realize how much of a difference body hair has on how lean you look. If you've never shaved your body hair off before, you have no idea how much of a difference it actually makes. Insecure dudes will think shaving body hair isn't manly and that only girls should do that. If you're a bodybuilder, or you're interested in bodybuilding in general, get that out of your head. Manscaping is common, especially in the fitness industry. The difference between having a hairy physique and having a hairless physique in terms of visible muscle detail and vascularity is so drastic that it will look like you've lost 3% body fat instantly just by removing the hair. If you've never naired, shaved, waxed, or whatever your preferred method is of hair removal, I highly recommend you try it if want to look more vascular and lean. You'll be shocked what you actually look like under that giant carpet you have on your body. Gain As Much Muscle As Possible The more muscle you gain, the more you're going to push your veins to the surface of your skin, and the more demand you will put on your cardiovascular system to support that muscle tissue. This is because the more muscular you are, the more blood flow and nutrients your body will require to support it. This comes in conjunction with having low body fat though of course. If you gain 20 pounds of muscle but you also gain a bunch of fat, obviously you can't expect to be way more vascular than you were before you started. However, bulking phases will provide you the opportunity to gain muscle so that when you strip the fat off during your next subsequent cutting phase you are much more vascular than you were before. Every time I cut down after a bulk phase, I was more vascular than the cutting phase prior to that. Expectedly, the more muscle I gained, the more vascular I became after each subsequent cutting phase. When I first started bodybuilding I was super lean, but I was a rail with no muscle mass so I had no visible vascularity whatsoever.

A lot of people don't realize this and are deficient in magnesium, potassium, and even restrict sodium unnecessarily. These are the most common electrolyte deficiencies caused by dietary shortcomings. Restricting sodium in particular is one of the worst offenders when it comes to things that directly impair your fullness and vascularity.  Not only are most athletes not eating enough sodium, many are deficient because of how much they lose during exercise. A common misconception is that restricting sodium will make you leaner looking and get rid of water retention. Oftentimes, restricting sodium is actually going to have the opposite effect and result in you looking flatter, less vascular, and hindering your performance.  Sodium is a necessary modulator of blood volume, and throwing off your sodium to potassium ratio with a subpar diet will prevent your body from properly regulating cellular water balance. There's a reason why bodybuilders have sodium dense meals pre-contest after their carb deplete when they are trying to fill out. Assuming you are hydrated and hitting your electrolyte needs via a well designed diet, sodium itself is one of the most important factors of your dietary needs when it comes to maximizing muscular fullness and getting more vascular. Stay Hydrated Your muscles are 79% water. If your muscles are water depleted you will look flat and have horrible vascularity. This goes back to the previous section where I covered electrolyte requirements. If you are drinking enough water, hitting your electrolyte needs (including sodium), and have enough glycogen; you will ensure that your muscles have enough intracellular hydration to stay full. When it comes to dietary factors, this all circles back to the fact that if you have flat depleted muscle bellies, you're not going to be pushing the veins to the surface of the skin and blood volume will not be properly regulated. You're not going to be getting that vascular and full look. Replenish Your Glycogen Stores If you are carb depleted, you are going to be flatter than you would be with topped off glycogen stores. This goes back to the pre-contest bodybuilder during peak week. They carb deplete during peak week, and then load up with carbs before the show to top off their glycogen stores and supercompensate the muscle. Now, obviously you don't want to be carb depleting and peaking constantly, but if you want to get more vascular and full, topping off your glycogen stores will ensure that. Each gram of glycogen draws in about 3 grams of water and is the main factor that will determine muscle fullness and quality of pumps [R]. Ensure your glycogen stores are topped off and the muscle is sufficiently hydrated with water if you want to maximize fullness and vascularity. How impactful this will actually be on your own fullness and vascularity will largely be dependent on your insulin sensitivity, but in general, that is what you need to know. Also, when I say topped off, I mean topped off, not spilled over. If you eat more carbs than your body needs, you will negatively affect your body composition and cause the opposite effect than was intended with your carb intake. Temperature I'm sure you've noticed that you are more vascular in the summer than the winter. If I hit an arm workout in the winter, as soon as I walk outside I can see my vascularity die within minutes just because of the temperature. This is because your veins will try to keep the blood flow closer to your core to keep your tissue temperature warm when the environment is cold. The opposite occurs when it is warm outside, which is why you get more vascular when you're hot. Your veins rise closer to the surface to try and get rid of some of that heat to cool you down. This is one of the mechanisms your body uses to regulate its temperature. Now, I'm not suggesting that you walk around with a heater or anything ridiculous like that, but one thing you can easily change is ensuring that you go to a gym that isn't too cold. A gym that is too cold will inhibit your pump and vascularity, and may even have a negative impact on hypertrophy to some degree. Increase Nitric Oxide For Vasodilation Nitric oxide (NO) is made naturally in our bodies and plays a significant role in cardiovascular health. It dilates blood vessels (vasodilation), which lowers blood pressure and increases oxygen in the blood.  Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a messenger to signal blood vessels to dilate, or contract and relax. Sufficient nitric oxide is needed to signal blood vessels to contract or relax to ensure blood is able to flow to and from the heart effectively. Nitric oxide production decreases with age, consequently reducing the elasticity of the cardiovascular system, and impairing the body's ability to ensure sufficient amounts of oxygenated blood are reaching vital organs. Eating enough nitrates and/or supplementing with nitric oxide precursors is very important to ensure that your cardiovascular system maintains optimized function as you get older. In addition, maintaining optimal nitric oxide levels will make you more vascular and improve physical performance. Nitrate Rich Foods Nitrate rich foods improve vasodilation by increasing nitric oxide levels in the body. Beets, spinach or lettuce are a few of the most nitrate rich foods you can add to your diet. Around 80% of dietary nitrates are derived from vegetables, and is just one more reason why you should eat your leafy greens [R]. Nitrates dilate the veins and arteries everywhere in the body, consequently reducing stress on the heart by improving blood flow. By dilating the veins, nitrates can make you more vascular. Nitrate has shown to be a significant precursor to Nitric Oxide in a dose-dependent manner in humans [R]. L-Citrulline To Boost Nitric Oxide L-Citrulline is the most effective supplement you can use to boost nitric oxide in the body. It is one of the few pump ingredients that's actually worth adding into your pre-workout, or into your supplement regimen in general. Those who don't have nitrate rich diets would benefit from it even more, not just in a vascularity context, but in a general cardiovascular health context as well. Citrulline is found in watermelons. You would need to eat 1.5 kg of watermelon every day to get 3 grams of L-Citrulline though, which is the minimum effective dose [R]. To get the maximum effective dose of L-Citrulline from your diet, you would need to eat 5.0 kg of watermelon per day to get 10 grams of L-Citrulline [R].  Obviously nobody is going to eat that much watermelon, nor is it a good idea to begin with in my opinion when there are far better ways to allocate your macronutrient/micronutrient intake allotments. This is why L-Citrulline supplementation could actually be worthwhile. The Problem With Commercial Citrulline Malate While L-Citrulline is a great supplement to have in your daily regimen, there is a red flag around L-Citrulline supplementation that you need to know about. I'm sure you've seen that some supplements have L-Citrulline in them, and some have Citrulline Malate. Some even say “L-Citrulline Malate”. This is a cheap trick companies use to deceive customers. Citrulline Malate is composed of 50% Malic Acid, unless the ratio states otherwise. Authentic Citrulline Malate is produced by chemically bonding free-form L-Citrulline to DL-Malic Acid. When L-Citrulline is chemically bonded to DL-Malic Acid, the end result is Citrulline Malate, which has unique properties. But the problem with the Citrulline Malate in the supplement industry is that it doesn't have this chemical reaction. It's just Citrulline mixed with malic acid in a big mixing vat in the manufacturing facility. There is no chemical bond like there should be to create authentic Citrulline Malate. It's just the two ingredients being mixed together in a cheap blend, and it's sold as “Citrulline Malate”, or “L-Citrulline Malate”. The reality is that it's just Citrulline stirred up with malic acid. While this isn't a huge deal in itself, the problem lies in the labeling practices companies use to artificially inflate the perceived potency of their product. 6-8 grams is seen as the max clinically proven efficacious dosage in the supplement industry in general. At least, that's what companies will tell you in their marketing. First of all, we already know that the actual maximum efficacious dosage of L-Citrulline is 10 grams per day [R].  In addition, the main issue is that the “L-Citrulline” in their product is actually as low as half of the stated label claim. As mentioned, Citrulline Malate is just a mixture of Citrulline and malic acid. Somehow, companies are getting away with labeling their products with the chemically bonded form Citrulline Malate and claiming they have 6-8 grams per serving in their pre-workout, when they actually just have 3-4 grams of Citrulline and 3-4 grams of malic acid per serving. Instead of labeling the following: L-Citrulline – 3 grams Malic Acid – 3 grams These companies are labeling their products like this: Citrulline Malate – 6 grams Making you think you are getting a high dose, when in reality you are getting the bare minimum efficacious dose per serving of 3 grams. Sometimes, companies will tweak the ratio to be a bit more in favor of a higher Citrulline content relative to malic acid, but this is rarely higher than a 2:1 ratio. So, if you see the following: Citrulline Malate (2:1) – 6 grams That just means that the company has 4 grams of L-Citrulline and 2 grams of malic acid per serving. This is the exact manufacturing process involved in producing the L-Citrulline and “Citrulline Malate” you get in preworkouts in the supplement industry:  As you can see, the Citrulline Malate manufacturing flowchart on the right literally just says, “mix”. If this was authentic Citrulline Malate, you wouldn't need to mix L-Citrulline with malic acid, it would be chemically bonded together by the end of the manufacturing process. You're not really getting what you're paying for, and most don't realize this is a tactic in the industry to get better margins and artificially inflate a products perceived efficacy. Even if a pre-workout had what on paper appears to be a top end efficacious dose of 8 grams per serving, how much L-Citrulline are you actually getting out of that serving? 4-6 grams at most. I have yet to see a pre-workout formula actually hit a top end L-Citrulline dosage, and of the ones that get close, they use Citrulline Malate to inflate their label. In addition, even if you had the bonded version (which supplements don't), reacted Citrulline Malate will break apart into L-Citrulline and malic acid right away after its mixed in water. It's all just a trick to artificially inflate a products perceived potency on a label, as each ingredient should be listed separately. Most supplements have malic acid anyways in the “other ingredients” section, which is still an active ingredient that does have some potential performance benefits. Both ingredients work on their own. Citrulline bypasses the liver and gets converted to arginine, which increases NO. Malic acid is a Krebs cycle intermediary that counters lactic acid buildup. How much do you need of each though? With Citrulline, we know where the top end data lies. Malic acid, we don't. There is research on Citrulline and Citrulline Malate, but not much data on supplementing with malic acid to replenish depleted levels as a Krebs cycle intermediary. I don't think we can make a generalized overview on how effective the malic acid component was in the Citrulline Malate research because we can't determine if the results were derived from the malic acid, the L-Citrulline, or both. At the end of the day, for vasodilation all you should concern yourself with is how much pure L-Citrulline is in each serving of your pre-workout supplement. The Reason Why Supplements Are Often Underdosed Here's the thing, there are margins in the supplement industry, and it is expensive to make a potent product and still profit off of it. Companies selling underdosed pre-workout supplements doesn't always just boil down to the companies being cheap. The Citrulline Malate deception is absolutely a cheap trick, but in a general context one thing I've realized is that it costs a lot to manufacture a maxed out turnkey product. After factoring in the cost to manufacture products, paying for a customer service team, the marketing costs, credit card processing fees, sponsoring athletes, etc. It all costs money. At the end of the day, there has to be a profit margin for these companies, otherwise it wouldn't even be worth making a product and selling it to begin with. And when you get into the market of turnkey formulas like pre-workouts, a company is expected to put a potent dose of every single ingredient in the product, which isn't feasible for many companies who have their budget allocated elsewhere. This is why there are loss leader trash pre-workouts that dominate the pre-workout supplement list on Amazon. These companies will create the lowest dosed product possible that still produces some noticeable benefit, and then blow out every other company by being a loss leader, or using deceptive tactics like the Citrulline Malate labeling tactic I described above. Even if you have a company that doesn't have a lot of overhead, it's very unlikely to be within their budget to produce a truly maxed pre-workout formula with a top end dose of PURE L-Citrulline (not Citrulline mixed with malic acid). If you ever see a truly high-dosed Citrulline based product, it is typically a straight up L-Citrulline product sold on its own, or is in a pump formula with just a few ingredients in it. It is simply not feasible for 99% of companies to put out a product maxed out in all aspects. And this is where I see a giant hole in the supplement industry that I can fit into. Gorilla Mode Pre-Workout Formula Many of you guys have been asking me when my pre-workout will launch. I've been blessed with a great opportunity with Gorilla Mind LLC. Our overhead is incredibly low because we actually share a manufacturing facility and warehouse with Happy Hippo Herbals. We also have employees that work for both companies, reducing our expenses even more. We also don't do any marketing at all as of now, because all of our sales to date have been organically driven by Chris, Mike, myself, and other affiliates in our circle that have helped push the brand's reach. We literally have not spent a dollar on sponsored athletes, sponsored posts, or anything like that as of now. Because of this, it gives me A LOT more leeway in my formulation limitations. Our budget for formulation is WAY higher than most supplement companies who are owned and operated by businessmen who just want to make money and don't actually have any organic reach on their own, and rely on sponsored athletes on salary to push their products. Gorilla Mode is in manufacturing right now and will have the highest dose of pure L-Citrulline per serving in the entire supplement industry, as well as maxed out dosages of every other ingredient in the formula as well. This will be a game changer product. I shake my head every time I see (insert famous influencer name here) launch their own supplement company and then talk about why their company is better and different than the rest. They aren't, and they don't even know what the f*ck they're selling half the time. They employ others to manufacture their products, and they have no idea what goes into making an effective product. I think it is blatantly obvious when these famous influencers talk about why their products are so great exactly why their product is going to be trash. They don't even know how their products work, because they don't use them and didn't formulate them, and they have to pay the overhead involved with having a team under them who is responsible for all of that. I will release the full formula in a dedicated post when the time comes, and if you want to be notified when it is ready for launch I strongly advise that you sign up for my mailing list if you aren't already.  Citrulline Vs Arginine One of the most well known pump ingredients is Arginine. The problem with L-Arginine is that it is very ineffective at increasing Nitric Oxide synthesis. Logically, you would assume that taking Arginine would be the most effective way to increase Arginine levels in the body. However, this is not the case. Oral L-Arginine is taken up and metabolized by the liver so much that it does not actually effectively increase Arginine levels, and it may even be unsafe to use because of how much excessive urea it yields [R]. L-Citrulline bypasses the liver and passes freely to the kidneys where it is metabolized to Arginine [R]. The most effective supplement that can be used to increase Arginine levels in the body to improve cardiovascular and metabolic health outcomes is L-Citrulline [R]. L-Citrulline supplementation has shown to lower blood pressure and provide atherogenic-endothelial protection [R]. When it comes to NO precursors to get more vascular, nothing beats an efficacious dose of pure L-Citrulline. PDE5 Inhibitors – Cialis (Tadalafil) PDE5 inhibitors like Cialis and Viagra are commonly overlooked because they are thought to just be erectile dysfunction medications.  Out of all of the common PDE5 inhibitors, Cialis is by far my favorite because of its long half-life (Viagra's half-life is only 4 hours), and its' efficacy is not inhibited by taking it on a full stomach vs an empty stomach. Cialis works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (hence being categorized as a PDE5 inhibitor) and acting as a potent vasodilator, allowing the user to achieve and sustain an erection with much greater ease. PDE5 inhibitors don't just increase circulation and blood flow to your Johnson though. They increase circulation everywhere. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) is an enzyme found primarily in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum that selectively cleaves and degrades cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to 5′-guanosine monophosphate (5′-GMP) [R]. PDE5 inhibitors are similar in structure to cGMP and work by competitively binding to PDE5, consequently inhibiting cGMP hydrolysis. The net result of this is the potentiation of the effects of Nitric Oxide in the body. Cialis And L-Citrulline Pre-Workout Stack So, with a PDE5 inhibitor we are enhancing the effects of NO in the body, you can just imagine what combining a PDE5 inhibitor with a potent NO precursor will do for vascularity and pumps. This is where combining a high dose of L-Citrulline becomes multiple fold more effective. I know a lot of bodybuilders who take a small dose of Cialis every day simply for the blood pressure lowering effect. More vasodilation equates to better circulation, which equates to lower blood pressure. This also results in the user getting more vascular. Basically, Cialis will result in lowered blood pressure, better erections, better pumps and more vascularity. By inhibiting PDE5 with Cialis and cranking NO through the roof with a high dose of pure L-Citrulline, we can create the most potent pre-workout stack for mind-blowing pumps and vascularity. 10-20 mg of Cialis with 6-10 grams of L-Citrulline 30 minutes prior to training in conjunction with a great diet is one of the most potent stacks you can use to get more vascular.

    "content": "How Many MCG Of T3 And T4 Do You Naturally Produce? | The Answer Might Surprise You     Instead of taking an arbitrary amount of T3 and T4, it would be wise to address potential dietary deficiencies and autoimmune triggers first and foremost. However, if exogenous T3 and T4 use is something you are dead set on, or you already use one or the other, you would benefit from knowing what healthy endogenous production actually equates to. I often see in the bodybuilding community this idea that 25 micrograms is not even a replacement dose for your natural T3 production. In a fat loss context, many bodybuilders assume that you need significantly more than that to produce appreciable fat loss. This is all misguided information and should be clarified with closer examination.   Table of Contents ToggleHealthy T3 And T4 ProductionT3 and T4 Reference RangeAddressing The Root Of HypothyroidismRecovering Healthy Thyroid Function Vs Hormone Replacement TherapyMisconceptions About Using T3 And T4 For Fat LossRelated Healthy T3 And T4 Production  On average, those with a healthy functioning thyroid gland secrete between 10-22 micrograms T3 and 94-110 micrograms T4 daily [R]. 1 grain of natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) is approximately 9 mcg of T3 and 38 mcg of T4. On paper, healthy endogenous secretion equates to approximately 3 grains NDT. However, some individuals with hypothyroidism may need more than that to achieve optimal results. T3 and T4 Reference Range Thyroid hormone production is much like testosterone in that there is a reference range. When you look at testosterone levels (free testosterone and total testosterone), the reference ranges are VERY general, which I'm sure you're aware of. The reference range can be as low as 250 ng/dL, upwards of 950 ng/dL for total testosterone. Some labs even go as high as 1100+ ng/dL. When it comes to T3 and T4, there is a reference range as well, which is what is generally viewed as “healthy”. I think it goes without saying that a level on the low end of healthy function is not going to yield the same quality of life in many cases as a level closer to the middle, or on the high end of normal. With that being said, oral absorption of exogenous thyroid hormones will not equate to exactly what your body would produce endogenously with healthy natural function. For example, popping a 25 mcg pill of Cytomel does not mean that you are directly supplying your tissues with 25 mcg after your body has broken that pill down. However, using clinical data as a reference point for where exogenous thyroid dosages should start is helpful. If euthyroid humans secrete 10-22 micrograms of T3 and 94-110 micrograms of T4, logically you can assume that you will probably need at least that much exogenous T3 and T4 to build up adequate serum concentrations in the blood. This is where many individuals run into problems though, as they will often start off the bat at 25 mcg+ of Cytomel monotherapy. Aside from the various potential issues that arise via traditional monotherapy, this dosage could be too high off the bat for many individuals. The same sort of thing happens in the bodybuilding community all the time with testosterone replacement therapy. Some bodybuilders will say that they are healthy and only using “TRT”, when the reality is that they are injecting 250 milligrams per week, which is actually the equivalent of being on a mini cycle year round. Addressing The Root Of Hypothyroidism It isn't normal for your body's immune system to attack and destroy your thyroid gland. It is triggered by something, and oftentimes the issue comes down to autoimmune problems. The most common triggers of thyroid issues are dietary deficiencies, ingesting things that your body simply can't handle, and environmental factors that are not being accounted for. Micronutrient deficiencies can result in suboptimal T4 production, as well as inhibit your body from converting T4 to T3 efficiently. Sometimes hypothyroidism is as simple as a Selenium deficiency caused by a subpar diet. If hypothyroidism is brought on via an autoimmune disorder, this gets a bit more complicated as there are many autoimmune triggers that can be the root of the issue. Things like medications (even the fillers in the medications), stress, viral infections, environmental toxins, compromised gut health (like leaky gut), and food sensitivities can all trigger an autoimmune flare where your body starts attacking your thyroid gland. Now, while some individuals have complex issues that aren't easily addressed, in general, if the thyroid gland hasn't been destroyed by the immune system, autoimmune flares can be attenuated in most cases simply by deploying a well constructed fasting protocol and/or elimination diet where you start to pull out any food groups (and things you ingest in general) that could be triggering your autoimmune flare. For some, removing gluten or dairy is all it takes. For those with extremely compromised gut health, removing literally everything except 1 or 2 food groups that supply the body with a sufficient amount of macronutrients and micronutrients may be necessary.  It all depends on your current situation and state of gut health. Mikhaila Peterson is an extreme example of this, and her story just goes to show how a “healthy” diet on paper may actually be harmful to you if you have intolerances to the foods you are ingesting. This is one reason why some individuals with thyroid issues can experience temporary relief with medications, and then suddenly experience a massive downward spiral down the line while using the exact same medication. Just because you're supplying tissues with a certain amount of thyroid hormones via exogenous NDT, you are not addressing the root of your issue which is destroying your body in the first place. If you have an autoimmune disease, your priority should be fixing that before your body destroys itself, not throwing a bandaid over it with T3 and T4 and then assuming you are fine and can continue with the exact same diet and lifestyle. If your body is attacking itself, it is telling you something. It is telling you that your current lifestyle, environment, and/or diet is not healthy for you. If you figure this out early enough, you can identify the problem, address the root cause of it, and maximize your likelihood of getting healthy again rather than slapping a bandaid on it with exogenous T3 and T4. Now, this isn't to say that T3 and T4 should never be used, but obviously the ideal scenario would be that you heal your body naturally as the autoimmune disease is not going to just randomly stop if the triggers have not been removed. Recovering Healthy Thyroid Function Vs Hormone Replacement Therapy When comparing the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis relative to the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis it becomes apparent that the Thyroid is more elastic in its ability to recover, even after significant bouts of functional suppression. The thyroid seems to bounce back much more easily than natural testosterone production does after endogenous suppression. This is not to be confused with autoimmune disorders that literally destroy the gland itself. I'm referring to endogenous hormone suppression caused by using exogenous thyroid hormones (hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis) or testosterone (hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis). Even after abusing T3 for years my thyroid still bounced back. I was afraid to come off as I thought that my thyroid production would stay crashed and I would gain tons of fat, but that wasn't the case. Even after a full year of artificially inducing a state of hyperthyroidism, I recovered adequate thyroid function within weeks of discontinuing T3. That's something that's probably not going to happen with natural testosterone production after several years of abuse of exogenous androgens though. Now, I'm not trying to say that hormone recovery is impossible after blasting steroids, however, I am trying to highlight the fact that when it comes to thyroid hormone production, it is typically much easier to recover healthy endogenous production, and it is worth trying to get back to a healthy level naturally even after years of abuse. Misconceptions About Using T3 And T4 For Fat Loss When I was completely enamored with bodybuilding years ago I noticed that anytime I used more than 50 mcg T3, regardless of what steroids I was running concurrently, I would start flattening out and lose muscle. Be cautious of this, as I do not see any significant benefit to pushing yourself into hyperthyroid range unless you're competing in a bodybuilding show and you absolutely need to lose insane amounts of body fat. And even then, if you need to artificially induce hyperthyroidism levels of T3 to lose enough fat before an event, you probably didn't allocate yourself enough time to diet down in the first place. When it comes to T3 and T4, I don't think it's something that really needs to be pushed during a cutting phase. Don't get me wrong, it helps, but T3 is the most catabolic fat burner you can use, even in the presence of exogenous androgens. It's common for newbies to use upwards of 75-100 mcg T3 for a cutting phase. Many of the top pros nowadays minimize their T3 use because of how badly it flattens you out and how catabolic it is at higher dosages.

    "content": "My Blood Work On 100 MG Testosterone Per Week (With Accurate LC/MS-MS)     I recently lowered my weekly TRT dose down to 100 mg Testosterone Propionate split into every day subcutaneous administrations with an insulin pin. Micro-dosing every day results in the most stable blood serum concentrations possible, less aromatization, and more free testosterone. Every day micro-dosing is the closest thing you can get to replicating what would otherwise be healthy endogenous secretion of testosterone. While more stable blood serum concentrations could be achieved with every day administrations of a longer ester like Enanthate, I opt for short esters for a reason.    Table of Contents ToggleWhy I Opt For Short EstersWhy I Lowered My TRT Dose To 100 MG Testosterone Per WeekInaccurate Testosterone Blood Test ResultsDirect ECLIA Vs. LC/MS-MS Blood Test ResultsMy Total Testosterone On 100 MG Testosterone Propionate Per WeekMy Free Testosterone On 100 MG Testosterone Propionate Per WeekMy Estradiol, Sensitive On 100 MG Testosterone Propionate Per WeekRelated Why I Opt For Short Esters The reason why I opt for short esters is because it gives me more leniency if I need to pull something in order to do an experiment for hair loss prevention, or for some health marker. It allows me to change a variable very quickly, have the hormone clear my system, and then give me accurate data to work with for my next experiment much faster. With long esters like Enanthate or Cypionate, if I wanted to do an experiment I would have to wait for a much longer hormone clearance period. You might be wondering, “Why would you want your testosterone to clear the system?” Well, some of my experiments are a bit unorthodox to say the least. Why I Lowered My TRT Dose To 100 MG Testosterone Per Week I've been trying to titrate my weekly TRT dose down to see what the lowest amount is that I can get away with without losing a high quality of life, good libido, good state of well-being, no brain fog, etc. My oldest TRT regimen at the very beginning was 200 mg Testosterone Enanthate per week, which was way too much. I was pretty much on a mini-cycle when I was using that much. Since then, I've slowly pulled back my dosages, and have been really pushing the envelope this past year to see how low I can get the androgen load in my body without losing muscle or experiencing impaired physiological functions supported by androgens. The reason why I'm doing this is because I believe that once you satisfy a therapeutic level of androgen receptor activation to support basic physiological functions, than any excess above and beyond that will likely just contribute to greater levels of organ stress than necessary. Most notably in a cardiovascular context. Basically, I want to minimize the likelihood of cardiovascular issues, while still maintaining as high of a quality of life as possible. By titrating down, I can evaluate where things level out in terms of risk to reward. Inaccurate Testosterone Blood Test Results Before we get into my blood test results, I would not be doing my due diligence if I skipped over the opportunity to explain why it is absolutely critical that you get high sensitivity testing done whenever you assess your hormone profile. As you may or may not know, the majority of men are not getting accurate blood test results. A minority of men using Testosterone even get regular blood work, and of that minority, an even smaller minority are getting accurate lab testing. If you get your Testosterone and Estradiol levels tested using the more primitive direct chemiluminescent immunoassays, you will not get accurate blood test results. I urge you to get your hormone levels tested with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) moving forward if possible. It is a more sensitive and specific method when measuring Testosterone and Estradiol concentrations when compared to immunoassay, and the difference in test results between the two methods are massive. Next time you need to assess your hormone profile, I advise that you at least get the following high sensitivity hormone profile and add the sensitive assay Estradiol test to your cart on top of that. High Sensitivity Hormone Profile Sensitive Assay Estradiol Direct ECLIA Vs. LC/MS-MS Blood Test Results Direct ECLIA is stated to be “sufficiently sensitive and accurate” for screening for androgen dysfunctions in men. The reality is, it is a rough way to assess deficiencies, but it is not a reliable way to accurately measure your hormone profile on TRT, and certainly not on supraphysiological doses of androgens. If you aren't getting highly sensitive and specific testing done via LC/MS-MS, you will not get accurate blood test results. I have proven this in my own blood work numerous times. The following is one example of this.   These Estradiol test results came from the same tube of blood. Night and day difference between the two results. Standard blood test assays can't even differentiate between Testosterone in your body and entirely different anabolic steroids. My “Free Testosterone” Level When I Was On 0 MG Of Testosterone But 200 MG Of Nandrolone Phenylpropionate Get high quality blood work when you get it. If you don't, you will be completely in the dark when it comes to deciphering exactly what deficiencies and/or imbalances you have in your hormone profile. My Total Testosterone On 100 MG Testosterone Propionate Per Week This is what my total Testosterone level was on 100 mg Testosterone Propionate per week determined via LC/MS-MS.  465.4 ng/dL on a reference range of 264-916 ng/dL. Frankly, I was a bit surprised. I thought it was going to be closer to 600 to 700. I was shooting for 700. I don't want to be teetering into mini-cycle territory, but I also don't want to be walking around with very average levels. 465.4 isn't even average, it's low. Keep in mind when you evaluate blood work that there should be a happy medium between quality of life vs. quantity. There's a balance that I'm still trying to achieve, regardless of my shift in priorities over the past few years. Ideally, I would have wanted to see a 700 ng/dL total testosterone level, or slightly higher. A lot of people are going to say, “total testosterone doesn't matter, all that matters if free testosterone.” Frankly, I think you would be best served by shooting for a high-normal free testosterone and a high-normal total testosterone level. Just because free testosterone is the measurable bioavailable androgens we can use, it doesn't necessarily mean that total testosterone doesn't have some sort of impact on physiological functions when you're accounting for the SHBG bound, as well as albumin bound testosterone in the body. There’s weakly bound testosterone in the body that may have some sort of physiological impact, and there may be other factors at play too that we are not yet even aware of that don't get accounted for when you only take free testosterone into account. In addition, the free testosterone test can vary wildly. It is notorious for being all over the map. That’s why I like to take the result of total testosterone determined via LC/MS-MS as well as free testosterone into account. I would just be more comfortable having them both on the high end of normal to be honest. My Free Testosterone On 100 MG Testosterone Propionate Per Week This is what my Free Testosterone (Direct) level was on 100 mg Testosterone Propionate per week.  19.6 pg/mL in a reference range of 9.3-26.5 pg/mL. It’s not exactly where I'd want it, but it is certainly better than my total testosterone level. My Estradiol, Sensitive On 100 MG Testosterone Propionate Per Week  My Estradiol level determined via sensitive assay testing was 23.8 pg/mL in a reference range of 8.0-35.0 pg/mL. My Estrogen sweet spot is around 30 pg/mL, so I evidently have some leeway to increase my weekly TRT dose. Based on my blood work I probably have 25 mg or so of leeway where I can build up to higher (but still therapeutic) Testosterone levels. I don't think there's going to be a significantly detrimental impact by me doing so. If I do decide to increase my Testosterone dose, I would also increase the amount of aromatization in my body. But, because my Estradiol is only at 23.8 pg/mL, that gives me a solid 11 pg/mL of leeway before I'm even at the top end of the reference range. These blood test results justify the addition of another 25 mg Testosterone per week should I decide I want to boost my total and free testosterone levels a bit higher.

    "content": "Julian Smith Bulked For 6 Years Straight | Should You Too?     Julian Smith claims he bulked for six years straight. He attributes the majority of his success/his accrual of lean muscle mass to this extended bulk phase he did that lasted six years. Julian Smith Before And After Basically, he walked around fatter than he needed to be for six years with the logic that he needed to be in a surplus for over a half a decade straight and walk around at 20%+ to maximize his bodybuilding progress. His claim is that being in a surplus for six years allowed him to put on enough muscle so that when he cut down he had a sufficient amount of muscle to be satisfied with his progress, which may have not been possible if he had followed a traditional bulk and cut approach. From what I gather, Julian Smith is asserting that in order to build muscle efficiently, you need to accept being a bit fluffy for a while in a consistent surplus to gain as much muscle as you can.   Table of Contents ToggleThe Problem With The Julian Smith Approach To Bulking When You Are Too FatInsulin Sensitivity And How It Affects Your ProgressFactors Working Against You During Excessively Long Bulk PhasesDeleterious Outcomes Of Excessive BulkingMy General Stance On How To BulkHow To Determine Your Maintenance And How Many Calories To Start Bulking WithWhere Do Diminishing Returns Set In During A Bulk Phase?Related The Problem With The Julian Smith Approach To Bulking When You Are Too Fat While I agree that a productive bulking phase will inevitably result in an increase in body fat, do you really need to bulk for over half a decade straight to efficiently build muscle? No, not at all. In my opinion, it's the complete opposite. I think that after a while, continuing to bulk is actually counterproductive. It's accepted that if you're in a surplus, you're going to gain some fat, however, walking around at 20%+ year round is a horrible idea if body composition and lean gains in muscle mass are your priority. I'm not sure if Julian Smith actually asserts that the way he went about his bulk was ideal, or if he just thinks it was ideal for himself. However, there's a few reasons I would advise against this kind of practice, besides the obvious drawback that holding too much fat will have on your sex appeal. Ideally, you want to be as lean as possible. Even if we look at this just in terms of ideal bodybuilding outcomes and throw everything else to the side, bulking for an excessive duration of time will eventually result in severely diminished returns, and eventually can even hinder your progress. The problem with bulking when you're too fat is you start to really hinder your insulin sensitivity. Insulin Sensitivity And How It Affects Your Progress When you start to develop insulin resistance, this will negatively affect your muscle growth potential. It will also make you far more likely to hold more fat. The fatter you are, the more prone your body will be to holding onto even more fat when you gain weight. Your nutrient partitioning starts to go down the toilet when you continue to bulk with suboptimal body composition. If you've ever forced yourself to continue gaining weight, I'm sure you have noticed this yourself. If you've gotten really lean, you'll notice when you start bulking back up that your nutrient partitioning is excellent. Your pumps in the gym are phenomenal and the weight you're gaining looks great. Each pound looks like clean weight with a favorable ratio of muscle relative to fat. And then, if you take in too many calories for a prolonged period of time, you will start noticing that your body composition quickly takes a hit and your insulin sensitivity seems to decrease. Your pumps in the gym are no longer as good, you're starting to notice your abs blur over more and more by the week at a very quick rate, and each pound you gain doesn't seem to be an ideal ratio of muscle to fat anymore. After a pushing your body for too long and letting your body pack on too much unnecessary fat, you will eventually hit a point where every single pound you gain is almost complete sh*t weight, and you're gaining far more fat than muscle. Julian Smith Before And After 6 Year Bulking Phase At that point, what is the smart move? To continue to bulk up and increase your calories even more? Factors Working Against You During Excessively Long Bulk Phases Your insulin sensitivity becomes so poor after a while that you are just digging yourself a deeper hole that you will need to climb out of when it comes time to cut. If you are a natural athlete, this will be much more detrimental to your muscle growth potential as you will need to diet even longer than you would have otherwise to strip all the garbage weight off. Even if you use exogenous anabolics, while endogenous androgen suppression is not a concern during the cut phase, is there really a point of continuing to hammer away in a surplus trying to milk more muscle gains out of that bulk phase when your Myostatin is so elevated that it is preventing you from even gaining more muscle in the first place? When your insulin sensitivity is subpar, your nutrient partitioning is impaired, and your Myostatin is elevated simultaneously, you cannot expect your body to respond optimally during an extended bulk. You would have far better outcomes cleaning out your body (if you use drugs), followed by cutting down to single digit body fat percentage, and redoing the process over again from a lean foundation. Deleterious Outcomes Of Excessive Bulking If you get to a point where you're gaining more fat than muscle, but you continue to slam your body with excessive calories despite being a high body fat percentage, you can actually start to cause ectopic fat storage. Ectopic fat storage occurs when you've consumed excessive calories for a prolonged period of time and your body isn't just storing fat as adipose tissue anymore, but it's also starting to store fat in other areas of your body too. You start to store fat in organs, muscle tissue, and in other areas that you shouldn't have fat depositions in for obvious reasons. In no scenario is storing fat in your liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and other important organs, conducive to muscle growth. Aside from the obvious things I've already outlined, gaining fat in excessive amounts and then having to lose it all afterwards will result in a much higher likelihood of a slow metabolism and stubborn fat stores. You’re going to have to peel all that weight off again afterwards. If every pound you gain, pound for pound, is far more fat than lean muscle, you're putting yourself in a position where down the line you're just going to need to cut harder strip that fat off. If you’re natural and rely solely on your own endogenous androgen production for the retention of muscle mass in a steep deficit, you're going to have to deal with the fact that you're going to have an even longer extended period of calorie suppression and endogenous androgen suppression. This will inevitably result in you being forced to be in a subpar hormonal state for muscle retention for a longer period of time just to peel that extra fat off. You're going to lose more muscle than you would have otherwise if the bulk had been cut off before the point where severe diminishing returns set in in the first place. My General Stance On How To Bulk I believe that a minor surplus is ideal for bulking without excessive fat storage. And by minor I don't mean 500-1000 calories. I literally mean 300 calories above maintenance. This will support recovery and muscle growth, but not cause excessive and unnecessary amounts of spillover. As you gain weight and start to plateau, your energy demands to continue growing will increase. At no point should your surplus ever significantly exceed 300 calories in my opinion. Keep in mind, your “maintenance” will change over the course of a bulking phase, as well as over the course of a cutting phase. If you have a legitimate maintenance of 3000 calories and start bulking at 3300 calories, and after X amount of time you stop gaining any weight for over a week straight (not even a 0.1 pound gain over 7 full days of eating the same diet), in general, it is typically safe to assume that your metabolism has adapted and your new maintenance is now 3300 rather than 3000 calories. This is common sense, and your body will adapt its metabolism to whatever calorie intake you have. If you've plateaued, you can add another 100 calories in to start progressing again. If that isn't sufficient, add more. But, you shouldn't ever be randomly jumping your calories up several hundred calories each time you plateau. This is the same reason why so many people burn out their metabolisms when they're cutting. Prematurely cutting calories before you've milked all the fat loss possible out of each incremental drop in calories will result in premature metabolic slowdown without the fat loss you could have squeezed out of that drop. I'm sure you know someone who has done this, or have done this yourself, where you plateau and then drop your calorie intake by another 300 calories, and before you know it you're cutting on sub 2000 calories and still can't lose weight and are starving all day. This is the same principle that applies to bulking. If you plateau, you shouldn't throw another 300 calories in, you will gain unnecessary amounts of fat. Milk the muscle growth out of each incremental increase, and then increase your calories once you've plateaued for a full week. In general, at the start of any bulk or cut, I use 300 calories as the increment to kickstart the process, but every drop or increase thereafter is a 100 calorie drop or bump, followed by a thorough milking of that increment until all the potential gains (or fat loss) from that increment has been exhausted. This is how I've been able to get shredded while still eating a reasonable amount of calories, as well as gain lean size while also eating a reasonable amount of calories. This is why metabolic priming during your bulk phases is so critical too, as an intelligently designed bulking phase doesn't just serve to build muscle and gain strength, it also sets you up for your upcoming cut phase and will allow you to get leaner with a higher calorie intake than would have been possible otherwise had you not primed your metabolism with an extended period of a surplus of energy. This is why if you cut for 12 weeks and get down to 2100 calories per day and plateau, you can't just take a break and then jump back into a “deficit” at 2700 calories (less than your maintenance on paper) and lose weight. Your metabolism will have adjusted to that 2100 calorie per day intake and slowed itself down to prevent you from starving. It is a defense mechanism, and learning to manipulate your body's regulatory mechanisms is critical for making your bulk and cut phases as conducive to your goals as possible. How To Determine Your Maintenance And How Many Calories To Start Bulking With If you don't know where to start, the first thing you should do is calculate your BMR and maintenance calories. This is the calculator that I recommend – Maintenance Calorie Calculator (I Recommend Using The Mifflin-St Jeor Formula Option In The Advanced Options Section) This must factor in your estimated activity level as well. This is a rough estimate of what your maintenance calories are based on your activity level and body type. These calculators provide very rough calculations and should serve as a guideline only. If a calculator says your “maintenance” is 3000 calories, but you've been eating in a deficit for 2 months and have stalled in weight loss at 2400 calories per day, your maintenance is obviously not 3000 calories anymore. This calculator should simply serve as a reference of where to start a bulk or a cut, and that's it. Even the baseline calculation can be off as much as +/- 500 calories at times. This is why I suggest you do what I call a “feeler week” when you start a bulk. This is where you eat a calorie intake equivalent to that of your calculated maintenance level calories for the first week of your diet. This week will be used as a “feeler” week to assess how inaccurate the calculator was relative to your actual maintenance. For example, if the calculator says your maintenance is 3000 calories, and you eat 3000 calories every day for a week straight but you lose 2 pounds, then it is obvious that the calculator was off by a decent amount and you can then adjust your caloric intake accordingly relative to what your actual maintenance most likely is. Or, if the calculator determines that your maintenance is 3000 calories and you eat 3000 calories every day for a week and you don't lose weight, but you don't gain any weight either, then it can be concluded that 3000 calories is indeed your actual maintenance level of calories. See what I mean. It is very useful to determine what this number is as accurately as possible because then you can be much more precise when calculating your macro and calorie intake each day, and know what to expect results wise at the end of each week. Once you figure out with a somewhat close level of accuracy what your maintenance is, then you can create your bulking diet and figure out what you will be eating each day. Where Do Diminishing Returns Set In During A Bulk Phase? As a general rule of thumb, lean bulk up to 14-15%, and then mini-diet and strip the fat off and get back to an insulin sensitive foundation in the single digits is what I find works best. I would not bulk past 16% body fat as the absolute maximum ceiling. Bulk up to 15%, then cut back down to 9%, and then rinse and repeat. Gain muscle, peel off the sh*t, gain muscle, peel off the sh*t and become insulin sensitive again. The only caveat to this would apply to newbies to lifting who are skinny fat, or are already 15%+ without a foundation of muscle on their frame. Guys who just need to build muscle and have no foundation to support their metabolism as they cut down would be best served by eating slightly above maintenance and focusing entirely on gaining as much size and strength as possible. Muscle is critical for staying lean without having to severely deprive yourself of nutrients, so building a foundation of muscle is a priority before you get into the bulk and cut cyclical process. As a newbie, you can get away with lean bulking for a long period of time without even needing to jump into a deficit, as in the grand scheme of things, it would be counterproductive to try cutting when you barely have any muscle on your frame. Obviously it is not an ideal position to be in where you have to try and “bulk” when you are already over 15% body fat, but you have to start somewhere and the sooner you build a foundation of lean muscle that can support a decent metabolic rate, the sooner you can then do a proper cut phase, get to single digits, max out your insulin sensitivity, and start to build on your foundation. While I do believe that newbies will benefit from an extended lean bulk, it certainly isn't ideal to bulk for six years straight still. There is no scenario in a health or bodybuilding context where I feel that being fat for six years is going to be more effective for building muscle mass than bulking and cutting down and becoming insulin-sensitive again. If you're wondering “how can I achieve a physique like Julian Smith?” In my opinion, the faster, smarter and healthier way would be bulking up and then cutting down once diminishing returns set in. Not bulking for six years straight.

    "content": "Is Post Finasteride Syndrome Real? | How To Diagnose And Reverse It     I believe that interpreting blood work correctly and implementing an appropriate lifestyle and/or pharmacological protocol can reverse Post Finasteride Syndrome. Post Finasteride Syndrome describes negative side effects caused by Finasteride that persist long-term, even after discontinuing its use. Finasteride-induced side effects can be very real. Let's talk about why that happens in the first place. In short, you need a certain amount of androgenic activity in your body to facilitate physiological functions as a male. For example, maintaining a high libido. You also need a physiological amount of Estrogen to support many overlapping functions as well. When you deplete these androgens and/or throw off the balance of androgens to estrogen in the body, you could experience erectile dysfunction, low libido, and a myriad of other issues.

This is not entirely the fault of the user. Most doctors are not going to preemptively suggest that you get baseline blood work, which is their own negligence. Obviously some level of responsibility falls on the patient to research what drugs they are going to be taking prior to taking them, but if a doctor has upwards of a decade of “education”, and they suggest you forgo blood work, or fail to even suggest it to begin with, it just goes to show that they probably shouldn't even be prescribing drugs in the first place. If you don't have baseline blood work to see what your hormone profile looks like, you will have no idea what to reference afterwards if an issue arises. Haphazardly giving somebody Finasteride without looking at their baseline hormone levels is a terrible idea. Which Blood Tests You Should Get Before Taking Finasteride You should get your baseline total testosterone, free testosterone, DHT, Estradiol and SHBG levels tested. While getting baseline blood work for as many major endocrine health markers as possible is ideal, the markers above are the bare minimum that you absolutely need. In addition, the quality of the testing is critical. If you get your Testosterone and Estradiol levels tested using the more primitive Roche ECLIA methodology (typically the default test most doctors will sign off on), you are going to get a completely inaccurate test result. I highly recommend you always get your hormone levels tested with high-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). It is a more sensitive and specific method when measuring Testosterone and Estradiol concentrations when compared to immunoassay, and the difference in test results between the two methods are night and day. Prior to starting Finasteride, I advise that you at least get the following high sensitivity hormone profile and add the sensitive assay Estradiol test to your cart on top of that. High Sensitivity Hormone Profile Sensitive Assay Estradiol Direct ECLIA Vs. LC/MS-MS Blood Test Results Direct ECLIA is stated to be “sufficiently sensitive and accurate” for screening for androgen dysfunctions in men. I'll tell you right now, it's not. If you aren't getting highly sensitive and specific testing done via LC/MS-MS, you will not get accurate blood test results. I have proven this in my own blood work numerous times. For example, the following test results are wildly different.   These test results came from the exact same tube of blood. Yes, it makes that much of a difference. Get high quality blood work when you get it. 99% of individuals don't get blood work at all, and of the 1% that do get it, 99% of those individuals don't get the proper tests. As a result, they're completely in the dark when it comes to deciphering exactly what deficiencies and/or imbalances they have in their hormone profile. Male Pseudohermaphroditism Caused By 5-Alpha Reductase Deficiency The way Finasteride works is by inhibiting 5-alpha reductase. Finasteride more or less creates a blockade whereby testosterone can't be 5-alpha reduced into DHT as efficiently as it normally would. Dutasteride inhibits 5-alpha reductase significantly more, and can crush systemic DHT levels as much as 90-99%. Dutasteride is so powerful that it almost induces a state identical to what pseudohermaphrodites experience as a result of a 5-alpha reductase genetic deficiency. 5-alpha reductase deficiency is a condition where genetic males (1 X and 1 Y chromosome in each cell) with male gonads do not produce enough DHT because they have a mutation in the SRD5A2 gene. This mutation prevents 5-alpha reductase from converting Testosterone into DHT adequately, which consequently results in a massive DHT deficiency. Depending on the severity of their deficiency, males with 5-alpha reductase deficiency can be born with genitalia that is not obviously male or female (ambiguous genitalia). In some cases, their genitalia appears female, or in other cases they definitively have male genitalia, but its unusually small (micropenis) with the urethra opening on the underside of the penis. During puberty, Testosterone and DHT spike significantly. DHT is several times more androgenic than Testosterone with a much higher binding affinity for androgen receptors, and is what is majorly responsible for the development of secondary sex characteristics like the deepening of the voice, development of facial hair and body hair, and the growth of the penis and scrotum. During puberty, men with 5-alpha reductase deficiency do not develop much facial or body hair, they appear to have no androgenic alopecia, and they have a small prostate. Many males with 5-alpha reductase deficiency are raised as girls until they hit puberty because they didn't have enough DHT to markedly differentiate themselves as males pre-puberty. Once they hit puberty and Testosterone levels spike, the penis and other androgen supported structures start to enlarge [R]. Expectedly, the penis doesn't grow to a normal size like it would in someone with an adequate amount of DHT, nor does facial hair or prostate growth occur to as significant of an extent. This genetic mutation is what shed light on the potential therapeutic applications of Finasteride in the first place [R]. It also reinforces the fact that Testosterone also causes hair loss, just to a far lesser extent than DHT.  Supporting Androgen Dependent Tissues Vs. Androgen Levels Necessary During Puberty Very similar to how HGH and IGF-1 levels determine how tall you get during puberty, Testosterone and DHT levels determine how much sexual development you experience during puberty. Once you're an adult, these androgens simply support existing androgen dependent functions though. A teenager in the middle of puberty could severely inhibit his sexual development by taking Finasteride. An adult could induce androgen deficiency side effects by taking Finasteride, but this could be manually reversed with ease via hormone manipulation. There's only a certain amount of androgen receptor activation you need in different tissues to support satisfactory function, and the necessity of maxed out DHT levels is lower post-puberty. This isn't to say that DHT isn't needed, but there's a reason why the majority of Finasteride users are side effect free. If you could thoroughly evaluate erection quality, libido, etc. before and during Finasteride use, I am sure that these would be hindered to some extent in the majority of users. You are after all slashing your body's primary androgen by upwards of 70%. However, that doesn't mean that you can't still support satisfactory function without that 70% DHT, hence why most do not experience any noticeable issues. It also doesn't mean you can't reach maxed out androgen support if you really wanted to via manual hormone manipulation, which we will delve into later. Once you create this blockade with Finasteride at 5-alpha reductase, you now have a bunch of testosterone that would have otherwise been 5-alpha-reduced, that now remains as testosterone. Finasteride will increase testosterone levels by roughly 15%, and Dutasteride will increase testosterone levels by roughly 22%. This is why males with 5-alpha reductase deficiency also have higher Testosterone levels than normal, and may even be more muscular than those with adequate DHT conversion. In most cases, Testosterone is more than sufficient to support androgen dependent functions as an adult in the absence of normal DHT levels. And in cases where it isn't, this is simply due to a lack of sufficient testosterone production, SHBG level being too high, mismanaged estrogen, or a combination of these. The same androgen dependent functions can be satisfied via any androgen though; Testosterone and DHT aren't special, which we will delve into later. Unaddressed Estrogen Imbalance Finasteride raising Testosterone levels might sound like a good thing. More muscle, less hair loss, how could this be a bad thing? Another cause of Finasteride side effects is an unaddressed Estrogen imbalance. When you have this 15% increase in testosterone, you have to take into account that testosterone also aromatizes into estrogen. If you have a significant increase in testosterone, you also get a parallel significant increase in estrogen in your body. In addition, DHT acts as an antagonist to estrogen in the body and also frees up bound Testosterone to SHBG. Testosterone is far less androgenic than DHT too. So, despite the fact that you're increasing your Testosterone and your estrogen by 15%, the drop in DHT Finasteride causes reduces the overall androgen load in your body. Estrogen increases by 15%, while you have a simultaneous 70% drop in the most androgenic hormone in your body that acts as an antagonist of estrogen and frees up bound testosterone from SHBG. Let's just say, hypothetically, you had an estrogen level on the top end of the reference range to begin with, and you take Finasteride and you push it outside of the therapeutic level, that in itself could cause estrogen dominance and result in estrogenic side effects. Now, what about individuals with side effects who have in-range hormone levels? This can happen in the following scenarios. If you had subpar free testosterone and DHT levels (could still be in the reference range, but not high enough), and Finasteride crushed your DHT while you maintained a normal Estrogen level in the reference range. Or, you have high SHBG levels, and the drop in DHT and/or the spike in Estrogen caused even more Testosterone to get bound up by SHBG, preventing you from getting sufficient free testosterone to facilitate androgen dependent functions that would otherwise be satisfied by endogenous Testosterone. Keep in mind, estrogen increases SHBG, and DHT lowers SHBG [R, R]. Finasteride or Dutasteride could both cause a hormonal sh*t storm where any of the following occurrences could cause and/or exacerbate a state of estrogen dominance in the body:  Your androgen load drops significantly via the decrease in DHT The decrease in DHT causes SHBG to bind up more testosterone in the body The subsequent increase in estrogen via the increase in testosterone causes SHBG to rise even more, consequently binding up even more testosterone  Increased SHBG will bind up even more of your testosterone, preventing it from being bioavailable. You could have a high total testosterone level, but if your SHBG is so high that you don't have enough free testosterone, you will likely experience androgen deficiency symptoms. This is also why it is so critical that you get high sensitivity blood tests. You could get a completely inaccurate blood test result and have no idea why you're still experiencing side effects, but the reality is that you aren't interpreting accurate information. If too much of your testosterone is bound up by SHBG, you could have low testosterone symptoms (fatigue, low libido, ED, etc.), and the simultaneous spike in estrogen could result in a state of estrogen dominance where you become prone to gynecomastia and a myriad of other estrogenic side effects. You could be estrogen dominant even with in-range estrogen levels simply due to an insufficient androgen load in the body. These are all things that are facilitated via an improperly managed hormone profile, and can be manually corrected. Now, the answer here is not to take an aromatase inhibitor and crush your Estrogen into the ground. Estrogen is needed to support libido and erections just as much as androgens. Even if you have sky high Testosterone and DHT levels, if you take a high dose of Letrozole and crush your Estradiol to zero, I promise you that your dick will cease to function. You need a healthy amount of estrogen, and an optimal balance of androgens to estrogen to maintain peak sexual function. The Implications Of Forgoing Blood Tests Users are quick to blame the drug, when the root of the issue is your hormone profile that is not being managed correctly. In many cases, had accurate blood work been thoroughly evaluated prior to taking Finasteride, it would have become clear that it wasn't a good idea to take Finasteride in the first place. Had you seen that your baseline bloodwork showed borderline high estrogen levels to begin with, low or low-normal androgens, borderline high SHBG, or a combination of these, it would be a lot easier to make an educated guess about what your risk profile was prior to starting. Even if you do increase your testosterone and estrogen by 15% with Finasteride and significantly decrease your DHT, the likelihood is that you will be side effect free. However, the fact remains that there is a possibility of dropping your androgen index to a point where you no longer have sufficient endogenous androgens to support male sexual functions. For example, if you have a guy who has Testosterone levels on the low end of the reference range, or he has high SHBG, and he's barely hanging on by a thread with satisfactory sexual function, and then he takes Finasteride and consequently crushes the DHT in his body that his penis was just hanging on for dear life to, can you guess what the likely outcome of that would be? You can predict with a MUCH higher level of accuracy whether you will encounter issues or not when you have a thorough baseline hormone panel to refer to. And even if you do still encounter issues, you can then pin point exactly what the reasons could be and how to attenuate the issue within short-order. Muscle Loss Caused By Finasteride? If you look at the clinical data, inhibiting 5-alpha reductase has no negative effect on the accrual of lean muscle mass. The following study was evaluated using Dutasteride, which is far more DHT suppressive than Finasteride. Even by nearly wiping out the participants' DHT levels with Dutasteride, they did not experience hindered muscle growth at all in response to graded testosterone doses. The DHT-deprived group had no significant disadvantage compared to the group that wasn't using Dutasteride [R].  The reason is that, if anything, the increase in testosterone would help you gain more muscle rather than lose muscle, because testosterone is more anabolic and tissue-selective than DHT. This comes with the caveat that your SHBG levels don't increase so much that you end up with less free Testosterone, but in most cases, the increase in Testosterone that occurs as a result of inhibiting 5-alpha reductase increases anabolic activity in the body. DHT is very androgenic, but sucks at building muscle. Testosterone has a significantly higher anabolic to androgenic ratio than DHT.  In the image above, the man on the left has a 5-alpha reductase deficiency, and his brother on the right doesn't have a deficiency. The man on the left has a higher testosterone level, is more muscular, and has less androgenic alopecia than his brother on the right who has normal DHT levels. The True Cause Of “Post Finasteride Syndrome” Other than supporting male sexual development through puberty, DHT more or less serves to sustain androgenic functions in androgen supported tissues that could otherwise be maintained by high testosterone levels, lowering SHBG and antagonizing estrogen. Now, these are obviously important, even in adulthood once the reliance on DHT is far lower as sexual development has already completed. Most individuals will do just fine with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, however, when you decrease DHT levels in men who are on the threshold of low androgen status to begin with, crushing DHT and spiking Estrogen with Finasteride, regardless of the fact of that their testosterone might be in the therapeutic reference range, can cause their androgen index to drop too low. This ultimately results in markedly decreased sexual function, and a myriad of other low androgen symptoms. Keep in mind, the reference range for these hormones are extremely general too. A doctor will tell you your testosterone levels are fine when you are walking around with a 300 ng/dL total testosterone level. And that isn't even factoring in that they probably haven't evaluated it with LC/MS-MS. They also probably haven't looked at your free testosterone at all, or your SHBG, or your sensitive assay Estradiol, or your DHT, or anything that could be useful to you because most physicians don't know a f*cking thing about hormone management. One time I asked a doctor to get my DHT tested and he told me I should get a blood test for testosterone because Finasteride lowers testosterone. Most doctors don't even know what hormones the drugs they're prescribing affect, nor do they know how to test them properly. This onus falls on you to learn how to manage your health. If you leave your Post Finasteride Syndrome up to a doctor to solve, you will 9/10 times be stuck with a limp dick and assuming that Finasteride ruined your life. “Post Finasteride Syndrome” is really just a fancy term for mismanaged estrogen levels and/or an androgen-deficiency induced by the Finasteride use. This is nothing that can't be alleviated simply by increasing your androgen index manually, and/or modulating your Estrogen levels. Most individuals who experience side effects and stop Finasteride recover with no issues with endogenous DHT levels returning to normal within short order once the Finsasteride has cleared their system and their body starts 5-alpha reducing Testosterone into DHT again [R].  The vertical dotted line represents when treatment was stopped during this study. The Finasteride treated group was using 5 mg per day for 24 weeks (roughly 6 months), and after stopping treatment, their DHT levels recovered to baseline within a month. Expectedly, those using 1.0-1.25 mg for hair loss prevention (the standard daily dose of Propecia, or Proscar prescribed off label divided into quarters) would experience a recovery of DHT levels within an even shorter time frame. Further complicating things is the fact that endogenous androgen secretion decreases with age [R]. After endogenous androgen secretion peaks in a man's youth, those levels plateau and then start to decline fairly quickly year after year. Total testosterone levels fall by 0.8%-1.6% on average per year, and free testosterone levels fall by 2%-3% on average per year [R]. SHBG levels also increase by 1.6% on average per year, which exacerbates the problem [R]. Total testosterone secretion dropping will decrease the amount of bioavailable free testosterone for the body to use, and the concurrent increase in SHBG binds up even more of the testosterone in the body, further dropping the amount of bioavailable free testosterone in the body. Most individuals who experience side effects from Finasteride were borderline low androgen status to begin with, and introducing Finasteride pushed them over the border. You can just imagine what kind of difficulty a borderline androgen deficient male would have trying to recover optimal sexual function when they are losing 2-3% of their bioavailable testosterone per year. For most who do experience side effects, the restoration of endogenous DHT production is sufficient to reverse the side effects, as they have effectively restored a sufficient enough androgen load to stimulate androgen supported tissues again. However, for those who experience persisting side effects, this is simply the result of persisting androgen deficiency or estrogen dominance. How To Reverse Post Finasteride Syndrome Now, there is debate as to whether or not Finsateride irreversibly inhibits 5-alpha reductase. The clinical data clearly shows that it doesn't, but even if it did, androgen receptors are still androgen receptors at the end of the day and can be activated by using any androgen, hence why Post Finasteride Syndrome is 100% reversible with hormonal manipulation. Let's break this down into what you can do naturally, and what you can do should the natural route fail. Natural Post Finasteride Syndrome Treatment Post Finasteride Syndrome is more than likely just an underlying androgen deficiency either caused by a lack of sufficient free testosterone and/or DHT. High estrogen levels, high SHBG levels, suboptimal endogenous testosterone secretion, or a combination of the 3 can exacerbate this. The goal here is to maximize bioavailable androgens, lower SHBG, and maintain healthy levels of Estrogen (not too low, and not too high). Should bioavailable androgen levels be at a healthy level, libido and quality erections are typically supported best with an Estradiol level around 30 pg/mL. These levels should be assessed using sensitive assay testing only, as outlined earlier in the article. Obviously there are exceptions to this, but in general, most men feel best with high-normal levels of bioavailable androgens, and an Estradiol around 30 pg/mL. This is the Estrogen sweet spot. There are some things you can do to try and optimize these levels naturally. Lifestyle  Exercise and lift weights often [R]. Get as close to 10-12% body fat as possible.  The leaner you are, the less aromatase activity you will have, thus resulting in lower Estrogen and SHBG levels, consequently increasing free testosterone and DHT levels [R]. Obesity is associated with low testosterone concentrations, which are not secondary to an increase in estradiol concentrations [R].   Gain as much muscle as possible.  Muscle mass not only supports improved insulin sensitivity, but it will increase your metabolic rate, consequently keeping you leaner, and thereby supporting a hormone profile with an optimized ratio of bioavailable androgens. These androgens then support increased muscle mass, essentially creating a virtuous circle of hormone optimization. Having enough muscle mass is the only way you will be able to walk around with a lean body composition year round without significantly depriving yourself of calories. Nutrient deprivation is not sustainable and will ultimately result in a slow metabolism and hindered androgen production.   Get enough sleep.  Obvious, but most do not actually get enough sleep. Most have a disrupted circadian rhythm and poor sleep hygiene, leading to suboptimal hormone secretion and inadequate amounts of REM and deep sleep.    Diet If you have no idea where to start and are feeling overwhelmed, I recommend trying the Vertical Diet. It is a turnkey easy to follow diet model that will ensure you are hitting your macros and micros, all while maximizing muscle and strength gain potential. I'm not going to breakdown everything you should be taking into account with diet as that would easily be an essay of content, and the Vertical Diet eBook covers it in elaborate detail, but here are a couple keys that you should adhere to that will help you be successful once you start following the Vertical Diet.  Eat enough healthy fats. Dietary fat is critical for producing sex hormones. Most don't realize how the body uses fat to produce testosterone in the first place (and consequently DHT), but many shoot themselves in the foot by severely limiting fats when they try and lose fat. Ensure you hit your micronutrient needs, not just your macros.  Set up a Cronometer account and monitor your micronutrient intake. Most people get so preoccupied with hitting their macronutrient and calorie targets that they completely fail to take into account that the body needs a sufficient amount of micronutrients to produce optimal amounts of androgens and modulate estrogen.    Supplements  Creatine Monohydrate [R].  This is the only supplement that you definitely will not be able to get enough of via a good diet. Use 5 grams per day, every day, for the rest of your life.   Boron [R, R].  The data on Boron is impressive, but I also view with skepticism. With that being said, Boron seems to be safe to supplement with, and may have a significant effect on reducing SHBG and increasing bioavailable androgens in the body. It is also very cheap, so its worth giving a chance.   Tribulus, Peruvian Maca, Tongkat Ali, Horny Goat Weed [R, R, R, R].  The “sexual health” market is full of junk. Of the products that actually contain efficacious ingredients, the standardization (extract) that is used in most commercial products is generally very low too. I developed the sexual health and libido formula “Horny Hippo” for my friend Chris (owner of Happy Hippo Herbals). It contains ingredients that work, at efficacious dosages and standardizations that will actually make a significant difference in your erection quality and libido. I ensured that it had the strongest possible standardization of every extract, with lab work to confirm.  Horny Goat Weed 10% Icariins (Industry standard: 1%) Tribulus Terrestis Extract 62.5% Saponins (Industry standard: 45%) TongKat Ali Extract 200:1 (Industry standard: 100:1)   With that being said, this product is ultimately just a bandaid. Frankly, I don't care if you buy it or not. This is something that works very well, but I'm telling you right now, you need to be more concerned with your overall androgen index than what random supplements you are taking to bandaid your issues.   Vitamin D [R].  Due to the predominantly indoor lifestyle humans have adapted to over the years, most people are not getting enough Vitamin D from the sun. And many will still not get adequate Vitamin D production even when they are exposed to the sun due to genetic predispositions. Take me for example, my genetics do not allow me to produce or process Vitamin D very well, so I need to supplement with a fairly high dose of it to reach healthy levels.    My blood test results taking 8000 iu Vitamin D-3 per day      You can check if you are predisposed to Vitamin D deficiency with 23andMe Genetic Testing. Check your blood work and add it to your hormone profile as well: Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy Blood Test Vitamin D is critical not only for optimized androgen production, but also for androgen receptors themselves.  The vitamin D receptor is expressed in reproductive tissues including prostate, testis and human sperm, and vitamin D receptor-knockout mice have gonadal insufficiency, suggesting a role for vitamin D in reproductive function [R]. A research group from Germany and Austria recruited 2,229 men from the prospective Ludwigshafen risk and cardiovascular health study. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, testosterone, luteinizing hormone and sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured, and the free androgen index calculated. Almost one-fifth of men assessed had hypogonadism. The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of these participants was markedly lower than that of men with sufficient testosterone. Regression analyses showed a significant association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and testosterone, free androgen index and SHBG, even after adjusting for age and body mass index. Variations in testosterone and androgen index followed a seasonal pattern similar to that of Vitamin D levels, with androgen levels peaking in the summer, and significantly decreasing in the winter [R].       I could have also included supplements like fish oil, Magnesium, Zinc, a B vitamin complex, and much more, but those are all things you should be able to get in and meet your micronutrient demands with a healthy diet. Meeting your micronutrient needs via whole foods is ideal and supplementing with nutrients you can easily get via food should be a last resort.  Unnatural Post Finasteride Syndrome Treatment Testosterone Restores Sexual Function In Male Pseudohermaphrodites I've seen evidence enough times now to know that testosterone can support all the same functions in the body as DHT, it's just that it requires a lot more of it to facilitate those functions in androgen dependent tissues with a dense amount of 5-alpha reductase production because it's more tissue-selective. There's a reason why certain tissues have far more 5-alpha reductase production than others. Now, testosterone is not very tissue selective in regards to myotrophic to androgenic activity, it's just far more so than DHT. The only reason males with 5-alpha reductase deficiency are able to go through puberty at all is due to the androgenicity of testosterone. If testosterone was not androgenic, male pseudohermaphrodites would have never developed any male characteristics and would look like genetic females for the entirety of their lives. This in itself not only exemplifies how testosterone is inherently androgenic, but it also reinforces the fact that testosterone will transcribe androgenic activity in affected tissues following its activation of androgen receptors (such as exacerbate hair loss in those with a predisposition to aggressive AGA). If you have a hormone that's mildly androgenic, but incredibly anabolic relative to DHT (what testosterone is), you would need more of it than normal in the absence of DHT to prevent androgen-deficiency symptoms. This is backed up in the clinical data conducted on male pseudohermaphrodites [R]. “Complete spermatogenesis was present on testicular biopsy in one affected subject, suggesting that Testosterone may be more important in regulating spermatogenesis than DHT. The affected males have erections and ejaculations; these also appear to be Testosterone dependent. Furthermore, in two subjects, the administration of pharmacologic amounts of DHT caused loss of libido and impotence. In the adult castrate male rodent, with the exception of one strain of mice, the administration of Testosterone restores sexual function, but DHT is not effective.“ I've proved this myself with my year long Dutasteride experiment. I took 1.0 mg of Dutasteride for a year straight with exogenous Testosterone. I kept my Testosterone levels on the brink of high-normal. Blood work proved that DHT was almost completely wiped out in my body. It was so low that DHT was not even detectable in my blood.  All I had to support androgen dependent tissues was testosterone, but because I had more than enough of it, I had 0 negative side effects at all. I had no libido issues at all. If anything, my libido was too high, and it was annoying.  As you can see in the reference ranges above, a woman would even be considered DHT deficient with a DHT level lower than 5 ng/dL. By taking 1.0 mg Dutasteride I not only crushed my DHT far lower than what the average woman produces, but I lowered it all the way down to as low, if not lower, than what male pseudohermaphrodites produce. This experiment to me proved that the functions of DHT can be replaced simply be replacing the disparity in the body's androgen load from baseline after inhibiting 5-alpha reductase. The reason is because all those same functions are supported just fine by testosterone, with the caveat being that estrogen is in the sweet spot and is modulated correctly. As long as the androgen load is satisfactory in the body, your androgen index is sufficient with enough bioavailable free testosterone, and your ratio of androgens to estrogen is optimized, sexual function will be sufficiently supported. And it's not just testosterone that can accomplish this. Sexual function can be supported by any androgen at the end of the day. The whole point is, androgen receptors are literally just receptors located in different tissues that can be activated by androgens to regulate gene expression. It's not like DHT is special, nor is testosterone special. It's just the fact that your body endogenously produces them to begin with that makes them seem special. AR activation is AR activation. Why Can't You Just Inject DHT To Treat Androgen Deficiency? Why would administering Testosterone fix androgen deficiency symptoms, but DHT administration further exacerbates it? The reason is that when DHT is administered, or any exogenous anabolic androgenic steroid, you shut down the HPTA. So, why does shutting down the HPTA matter when you are trying to rely on exogenous androgens anyways? Well, when you shut down the HPTA with DHT, you are also consequently eliminating the body's source of Estrogen as a result of Testosterone production being suppressed. DHT on its own doesn't lower libido, but administering exogenous DHT will cause the body to shut down its natural production of Testosterone, and consequently Estrogen and endogenous DHT too. Hence why administering DHT without a source of Estrogen will crush libido and cause muscle loss too. And even if it didn't right away, it would eventually once the endocrine system had been suppressed significantly enough and the body enters a state of Estrogen deficiency. Testosterone administration restores libido because it not only provides a sufficient amount of Estrogen, but it also 5-alpha reduces into DHT. However, the 5-alpha reduction of DHT isn't what facilitates the restoration of libido, its the sufficient serum concentrations of bioavailable free testosterone in conjunction with a healthy level of Estradiol. The 5-alpha reduction of DHT certainly helps, but its not necessary for achieving satisfactory levels of androgens. The only scenario in which injecting straight DHT could restore sexual function and maintain it long-term is if it was used in conjunction with exogenous Estradiol. However, that would then make you Testosterone deficient and cause muscle wasting because DHT has such poor anabolic activity. The only way you ensure that all pathways are fulfilled is by injecting Testosterone and monitoring your Estrogen, SHBG, DHT, total T and free T levels closely. Then you get into the weeds of optimal injection frequency to minimize aromatization, maximize free T, and optimal testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) practices. I have outlined these practices in other articles, and will not delve into it in detail here. Why Do Some People With Post Finasteride Syndrome Get Worse After Using Testosterone/TRT? One thing I can say with a high level of certainty is that the majority of individuals who don't experience relief of Post Finasteride Syndrome with exogenous Testosterone use are not properly incorporating the natural hormone optimization practices outlined above, aren't implementing optimal TRT practices, or have no idea how to properly interpret their blood work (or aren't getting accurate testing to begin with). If you think that the doctor who prescribed you Finasteride in the first place without evaluating your hormone profile properly is going to be able to prescribe you an intelligently constructed TRT protocol, you're insane. Exogenous steroid use is on another level from hormone assessment on Finasteride, and has many more moving parts at play. How many physicians know how to properly monitor hormone levels? Standard “TRT” is usually an infrequent mega-dose of Testosterone administered with unnecessary harmful aromatase inhibitors (AI's) and a myriad of other horrible practices. This is not how TRT should be implemented, and can often lead to deleterious outcomes with further diminished quality of life. The goal here is restoring an adequate androgen index in the body, with a healthy androgen to estrogen ratio. If that is accomplished, regardless if its done with Testosterone, or by increasing your androgen load with any other androgen under the sun, the end result in a penis function context will be the same. Obviously, the most predictable and efficacious of those being Testosterone, as it is the literal bioidentical androgen we naturally secrete, and we already know it acts as a precursor to all of the other hormones we need to modulate sexual health sufficiently, with a reasonably predictable risk profile. But, for the sake of illustrating my point, let's just say you gave me a guy with Post Finasteride Syndrome and then handed me a vial of Drostanolone (Masteron) and a box of micronized Estradiol pills and told me to figure out how to fix him. Masteron is a very androgenic hormone, but far more tissue selective than DHT still. After being injected, Masteron would bind to androgen receptors just like Testosterone and DHT would, and then transcribe its effects in androgen-affected tissues in a dose dependent manner. The result is the exact same as any other androgen, the degree to which these effects occur simply boils down to the drugs inherent androgenicity, and tissue selectivity. At some dosage, androgen-affected tissues would be adequately stimulated by Masteron, and then micronized Estradiol could be administered to get E2 levels up to 30 pg/mL manually. Now, obviously you shouldn't do this, but I'm just giving an extreme example of what this “syndrome” essentially boils down to. If androgens are low, libido and erectile quality will go down. If estrogen is too low or too high, libido and erectile quality will also go down. When enough androgens are present as well as enough estrogen, libido and erectile quality will be supported. That's it. So, aside from exogenous Testosterone administration, are there any androgens you can administer that will increase the androgen load in the body to satisfactory levels but won't cause endocrine shutdown? Yes, Proviron is a viable candidate for this. Proviron Use For Treating Post Finasteride Syndrome Mesterolone (Proviron) is one of the best compounds that can be used for treating Post Finasteride Syndrome in my opinion. The reason being that Proviron is minimally suppressive, whereas exogenous Testosterone use will cause HPTA shutdown. In a clinical setting, Proviron is used to treat androgen deficiency and to support male fertility. Teenage boys who experienced delayed puberty are also prescribed Proviron to push the process along. Proviron is not a substrate for 5-alpha reductase or aromatase; therefore it is not potentiated by 5-alpha reduction and does not convert into estrogen. It also has no progestogenic activity Proviron is a very poor anabolic agent due to inactivation by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in skeletal muscle tissue, similarly to DHT. Proviron is not 17α-alkylated, so it has little or no potential for liver toxicity. Deleterious effects on cardiovascular health are still possible with Proviron, but the overall risk profile in general is lower with Proviron use than with other comparable androgenic agents. Testosterone Vs. Proviron For Treating Post Finasteride Syndrome To clarify my stance on Proviron, I do not believe its the ideal candidate for a male who has low testosterone. For men with low total testosterone levels and low free testosterone levels, TRT is ideal in my opinion. However, for those who experience persisting androgen deficiency symptoms after Finasteride use, but otherwise have a healthy total testosterone level, then Proviron would be a better choice to start in my opinion. A “healthy” total testosterone level is not any number in the reference range. I would assert that as a rough guideline, a healthy total testosterone level is at least 600 ng/dL, with a free testosterone on the upper end of the reference range. As an experiment, I lowered my TRT down as far as I could to see how low I could go on a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor while still maintaining adequate sexual function. I got my total Testosterone all the way down to 465.4 ng/dL at my lowest. And my free Testosterone (direct) was 19.6 pg/mL.    I would prefer to see my total testosterone above 600 ng/dL and closer to 700 ng/dL, but my free testosterone level being high-normal is far more important. Despite being DHT deficient via 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use, I was still able to maintain a good libido and erection quality with a free testosterone level on the high end of normal and a hardly satisfactory total testosterone level. Let's just say hypothetically you have a total testosterone level of 350 ng/dL, a free testosterone level on the low end of the reference range and have Post Finasteride Syndrome. This is a scenario in which I believe an intelligently designed TRT protocol would be worth exploring and would be the best course of action. I emphasize “intelligently designed TRT protocol” as most physicians will not be knowledgeable enough to provide this, and goes back to my explanation earlier about why TRT can make things worse if it isn't implemented properly. With that being said, if you have checked off all the boxes in the “natural Post Finasteride Syndrome treatment” subsection I outlined earlier in the article (most important being lifestyle and diet) and you still have low total and low free testosterone, it will likely not resolve itself without exogenous hormones, and would then make you a prime candidate for TRT. Now, let's just say hypothetically you have a total testosterone level of 750 ng/dL and a free testosterone level on the low end of the reference range and have Post Finasteride Syndrome. This is a scenario in which I believe Proviron would be worth exploring and would be the best course of action. The reason being that you clearly have adequate testosterone production if you have a 750 ng/dL total testosterone level. The issue is not your testosterone production in this scenario, rather, the issue is that you do not have enough bioavailable free testosterone available to actually use. Even if you have a total testosterone level on the high end of the reference range, if SHBG has too much of it bound up, you won't have enough free testosterone available to support androgen-affected tissues (like your penis). Most circulating testosterone is bound to SHBG, and a lesser fraction is bound to albumin. Only a small fraction of your total testosterone is actually available to tissues as free testosterone. Testosterone weakly bound to albumin can dissociate freely in the capillary bed and become bioavailable for tissue uptake; however, SHBG still binds the majority of your testosterone and renders it inactive. Proviron not only directly supports tissues via its inherent androgenicity, but it has a very high affinity for SHBG. Because of this, Proviron is very effective at displacing endogenous testosterone from SHBG, which then significantly improves the ratio of bioavailable androgens relative to estrogen and SHBG in the body [R]. For someone who is on TRT and is encountering issues modulating their hormones, Proviron is extremely effective at facilitating a balancing act in the body and increasing the amount of available free testosterone to tissues. For someone using Proviron by itself, while Proviron doesn't directly increase free testosterone, it still modulates the androgen index in the body and can correct a hormonal imbalance without causing complete HPTA shutdown. Proviron is the least suppressive androgen and can be used at high doses without inducing HPTA shutdown. It is still an anabolic androgenic steroid at the end of the day, but it has some unique characteristics that make it ideal in this context. As Proviron is still suppressive, its use suppresses total testosterone levels, which consequently reduces estrogen levels in the body. In addition, via the suppression of testosterone production, Proviron significantly reduces of SHBG [R, R]. Because Proviron has such a high affinity for SHBG, it also displaces a significant amount of bound testosterone that otherwise wouldn't have been available to tissues in the body. Despite total testosterone production decreasing as a result of endocrine suppression, Proviron effectively frees up so much SHBG bound testosterone that it can maintain free testosterone levels in the body at the exact same serum concentrations as would have been found in baseline blood work. However, because estrogen and SHBG levels are now significantly lower in the body, via Proviron's inherent androgenicity and the optimization of the body's androgen index, sexual function should significantly improve in individuals who have optimal total testosterone levels on paper and still experience Post Finasteride Syndrome. Testoserone And Proviron Used At The Same Time For Treating Post Finasteride Syndrome If someone who had low total testosterone and low free testosterone implemented all of the necessary lifestyle and diet changes, as well as implemented a properly designed TRT protocol and still did not experience relief of Post Finasteride Syndrome, this is where Testosterone and Proviron may be worth exploring. As mentioned, Proviron is an effective agent for regulating the androgen index in the body in a dose dependent manner. If you started TRT, and your total testosterone levels are now on the high end of normal, or even above that, and you still can't achieve high free testosterone levels, or you cannot achieve high free testosterone levels without using such a high dose of testosterone that you induce estrogenic side effects from excessive amounts of aromatization, this is where Proviron alongside TRT will become an excellent option. Proviron more or less helps you maximize the amount of free testosterone in your body. Meaning, the higher the dose of Proviron, the more you can displace bound testosterone from SHBG and increase your free testosterone. Therefore, if you can't achieve an adequate free testosterone level because your SHBG is too high, or your Estrogen levels get too high at the TRT dose you need to achieve high free testosterone levels, then Proviron can be implemented to balance everything. How To Use Proviron With TRT If Your SHBG Is Too High If your issue is that your SHBG is too high and your total testosterone is at the top of the reference range, or even higher than the reference range, and you still can't achieve high free testosterone levels, then add in 25 mg of Proviron per day and reassess in a couple weeks. If that doesn't suffice, try 50 mg of Proviron per day and reassess in a couple weeks. And so on until you have displaced enough bound testosterone from SHBG with the Proviron to achieve high free testosterone levels and have restored sexual function. There is some dose of Proviron that will displace enough bound testosterone from SHBG that will allow you to reach high free testosterone levels without having to use so much testosterone that your total testosterone is outside the therapeutic reference range. How To Use Proviron With TRT If Your Estrogen Is Too High If your issue is that you can only achieve optimal free testosterone levels by using a dose of testosterone that elevates your estrogen too much and causes estrogenic side effects, then lower your testosterone dose to whatever dose you can handle without any estrogenic side effects, and then add in 25 mg of Proviron per day and reassess in a couple weeks. If that doesn't suffice, try 50 mg of Proviron per day and reassess in a couple weeks. And so on until your free testosterone levels are high enough that your ratio of bioavailable androgens relative to estrogen does not cause any estrogenic side effects and you have simultaneously restored sexual function. If you somehow are still having problems even after all that, then you can try to titrate your testosterone dose up a bit more until sexual function is restored, as the increased amount of bioavailable androgens will allow you to get away with a slightly higher estrogen level without any estrogenic side effects than you would have otherwise. This is why some bodybuilders can use a high dose of testosterone without any estrogenic side effects (not all, but some can), because estrogenic side effects aren't a direct result of the Estradiol blood test result on paper, rather, they're a result of a suboptimal androgen to estrogen ratio. The higher the bioavailable androgen load in the body is, the more estrogen can be present in the body without inducing estrogenic side effects. This is also why men can experience gyno with testosterone and estrogen levels in the reference range. If you are androgen deficient, you can still experience estrogenic effects even with a 35 pg/mL Estradiol level. Finasteride Is An Anti-Androgen While it will be difficult, try and find a doctor who knows what they're talking about who will help you work through this and get accurate blood work to monitor your progress. Doctors shouldn't haphazardly give you something that depletes your DHT levels by as much as 70% without getting your baseline blood work. While responsibility lies on the doctor, you also need to do you own research. It’s baffling to me how many people do not understand that Finasteride is an anti-androgen. While it doesn't fall into the traditional medical definition of an anti-androgen, the fact remains that 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are designed to severely deplete the body's androgen levels. If you intentionally take a drug that is designed to deplete your androgen levels, you should expect that androgen deficiency symptoms could be a possible outcome. The main problem lies in the lack of education. Most doctors have no idea how this drug works, and they also don't know how to educate their patients about how it works, nor do they try. Harm reduction is also rarely implemented, when it is more than warranted. Get some f*cking baseline blood work for the guy, you're about to prescribe him a f*cking drug that lowers his DHT levels by 70%! This isn't a pill that just prevents hair loss and gets rid of an otherwise unnecessary hormone. DHT supports androgen-affected tissues in the body for a reason. It's not something that cannot be supported by other androgens, like I've mentioned. But the fact remains that certain individuals only have so many endogenous androgens to begin with. Some men are pretty DHT-dependent because they aren't super high T individuals who can support those functions otherwise. Or they have a poor balance of androgens to estrogen. Or they have a poor balance of androgens to SHBG. Inhibiting 5-alpha reductase in these individuals could very likely result in a dysfunctional ratio of hormones in the body. This is something you need to understand for yourself before you start popping pills, because the likelihood that your doctor will teach you about it is extremely low. When you walk into a doctor's office and say “I have hair loss,” they're going to say “okay, take Minoxidil or Finasteride.” They'll gladly prescribe you Finasteride, perhaps briefly outline the potential side effects of it, and then send you on your way without explaining why the side effects occur, or how you could predict if they will occur in the first place. What they don't communicate to you is that Finasteride is deigned to deplete your androgen levels. Expecting an outcome where there's zero chance of having androgen deficiency related symptoms is ridiculous. However, if you fully understand this before going into it, you can assess your baseline hormone profile, and gauge your risk profile with a far greater level of accuracy. You would also be able to reverse any negative outcomes you may have because you would understand why it occurred and how to fix it. Summarizing Post Finasteride Syndrome At the end of the day, what this comes down to is getting accurate blood work, being able to make an educated conclusion based on your blood work if using Finasteride is a viable risk for you to take. And if you do have Post Finasteride Syndrome, it comes down to getting accurate blood work, knowing how to interpret it, and then implementing an appropriate lifestyle and/or hormonal protocol to address the issue you're having. There is a ratio of bioavailable androgens relative to estrogen that will restore sexual function in any individual who is an otherwise healthy individual and does not have a mental disorder, or some other outlier medical condition irrelevant to Post Finasteride Syndrome that is causing sexual dysfunction. If your penis worked fine before using Finasteride, and you are still an otherwise healthy person, there is some optimal ratio that can be manually achieved that will restore satisfactory function. If somebody has “Post Finasteride Syndrome,” it can easily be resolved by manually increasing your androgen index while modulating your estrogen levels. In my opinion, anybody who has it is not interpreting their blood work correctly and/or isn't implementing pharmacological intervention to attenuate whatever potential imbalances they have in their hormone profile as a result of inhibiting 5-alpha reductase.

View this post on Instagram                      DONT TRY THIS! last night I had this crazy idea that me and @cbum_ should attempt a 400lb barbell curl. Was all fun and games until I tore my bicep. I really should have known better, I forgot to warm up properly and should have used #koalafreak pre from @staunch.nation instead of the stim free ? Bicep: Pretty sure it’s a Grade 2 tear going off the web and the symptoms. Can Take up to 3 weeks before I’ll get strength back. I’ll try and see a specialist and get their opinion on it too. Note: Learn from my stupid mistakes! You can see half the arm workout on my YouTube ch. A post shared by  ??VON.MOGER (@calumvonmoger) on Nov 30, 2017 at 1:49pm PST   \n\n Shortly after recovering from that bicep tear, Calum had an even more severe injury occur in April 2018.                View this post on Instagram                      The day I almost died. Turn up volume listen for the “pop” Thanks to my older brothers @harleyvonm @alex_v_moger who pulled me up the cliff and Thank God im still alive. On way to hospital now with @parker_physique & @iamthmpsn A post shared by  ??VON.MOGER (@calumvonmoger) on Apr 18, 2018 at 8:16pm PDT   \n\n As a bodybuilder, obviously this was extremely demoralizing for him, and he spent the majority of 2018 recovering from his injuries. As you would expect, he lost a significant amount of size. After having recovered from the April 2018 injuries, Calum started to gain size back very quickly. So quickly that many were baffled as to how someone could gain so much muscle in such a short span of time. In this article, I'm going to explain what the “secret” was to his quick comeback. The Real Reason Why Calum Von Moger Gained Size Back So Quickly  And no, before you just say “steroids”, please show me someone who is a veteran steroid user who has been saucing for years who is able to gain a lean 30+ pounds in a matter of months. It's impossible, unless you fall into one of 2 scenarios:  You are recovering from an injury, surgery, or sickness You've allowed yourself to downsize by taking time off of the typical dosages of exogenous hormones you use  In Calum Von Moger's case, he lost what appeared to be 30+ pounds (just a ball park guess). The only reason he was able to gain back that size so quickly is the bank of myonuclei he had built up prior to being injured. In other words, muscle memory. Muscle Memory There is no secret to how Calum Von Moger gained so much size back so quickly. The reality is that he’s just built up a strong bank of myonuclei and is able to bounce back quick once adequate stimuli is reintroduced. He's very likely using the same hormones and same dosages as he used to. Probably the same hormones and dosages that most regular joes with subpar genetics use who crank at your local gym too. Using a sufficient amount of exogenous hormones, coupled with consistent training and adherence to a decent diet would allow him bounce back extremely quickly. This is not limited just to genetic freaks with superior genetic response. The reason he was able to build such an impressive physique in the past was due to his superior genetic response to both drugs and training. But, the reason he was able to gain the amount of muscle back that he did so quickly was due to the fact that he had already built that muscle in the past. Muscle memory is a phenomenon in the human body wherein the accrual of myonuclei is permanent. Meaning, even if you are sidelined by an injury, or come off of gear, or just stop training and dieting correctly in general, while you will inevitably lose size, any progress you've made in the past is essentially logged in your muscle tissue. The myonuclei remains there, regardless if you tore your bicep curling with Chris Bumstead and are forced to take several months off the gym [R]. This is why when you get back in the gym after an injury, or after surgery, you can gain size back so quickly, because it never really disappeared to begin with. The cells are still present, and it is up to you to induce hypertrophy in them again to get back to where you left off.  In addition, more recent studies also suggest that the myonuclei gained from using supraphysiological amounts of exogenous androgens also sticks around forever [R]. This is big because the data available now not only implies that you can bounce back to your genetic potential very quickly, but you can even bounce back to a physique far past your genetic potential very quickly too once sufficient amounts of exogenous androgens are reintroduced. It also suggests that there is a performance enhancing advantage to having used exogenous hormones, even if you have been natural for years. Kevin Levrone – Another Prime Example Of Muscle Memory When Kevin Levrone needed to get back in shape and come out of retirement, within short order he blew back up and took full advantage of that myonuclei bank (muscle memory) he had accrued throughout his career. Kevin Levrone before working out, in his prime, and then after retiring from bodybuilding It is also well known that Kevin would take many months off of bodybuilding even during his prime, and then grow into the Olympia every year. This was accomplished through the exact same mechanism. He had built up the majority of his size throughout the beginning of his career, which then allowed him the opportunity to come off the drugs and downsize during portions of the year and clean out his system. As the date of the Olympia would draw closer the following year, Kevin would reintroduce a strict diet and training regimen, as well as the exogenous hormone support needed to blow back up within just a handful of months to prepare for the show.  Obviously building an impressive physique like Kevin's would be impossible within a handful of months, even with his alien-like genetics. But, stimulating hypertrophy in existing muscle cells to blow back up to your peak in a handful of months after jumping back on cycle, that is definitely in the realm of possibility for some individuals. Obviously Kevin Levrone is an extreme genetic outlier, but he is a prime example of what superior genetic response coupled with taking advantage of muscle memory can look like in practical application in a bodybuilding context. The time Kevin took off undoubtedly helped him stay healthier throughout his prime bodybuilding years, where many other guys were likely brutalizing their bodies year round. In regards to this article in particular, it serves as another notable reference of what is possible in the most extreme of related scenarios. The Bank Of Myonuclei Calum Von Moger Built Up Calum Von Moger started bodybuilding at 14 years old [R].  He went on to win his first bodybuilding competition in 2010. Calum had been consistently training for 13 years before he experienced the bicep tear in 2017. And he had likely been using anabolic steroids for at least a handful of years prior to the injury as well. As you can imagine, that's a significant amount of time to build up a huge bank of myonuclei (muscle memory). Via that bank of muscle memory, Calum is easily able to gain back huge amounts of size even after significant setbacks. So many naive people assumed his career was over once they saw how much he had regressed. That is definitely not the case. Extremely quickly, Calum was able to pack on that “lost” size again.                View this post on Instagram                      #Tb when I was looking like a half sucked mango and people were like “yeah na your finished. Or “he’s done, his careers over”. Vs Today. Where are those people now…? #Unbroken A post shared by  ??VON.MOGER (@calumvonmoger) on Sep 5, 2019 at 5:36pm PDT   \n\n He hasn't recovered 100% of his size, but the difference between him at his most downsized compared to now literally looks like a 5+ year bodybuilding transformation. I believe at his age, Calum could gain the remainder of his lost size back pretty easily in another few months if he really wanted to.  This would likely involve steroid use at dosages exceeding high-normal TRT, and who knows if he really wants to push his body that hard anymore. He could be hair loss conscious now and perhaps doesn't want to push his androgen load too high, we don't know for sure. All that matters is understanding that there isn't some secret you are missing out on. He's not using Increlex, he's not using 5 grams of gear, he's probably doing the exact same thing he used to do and is in the gym again consistently giving his body the stimuli it needs to get back to where it was. What This Means For You? If you are a natural athlete, do not waste your youth when your endogenous androgens are peaking and you have the greatest opportunity to build up a strong myonuclei bank that you can then lean on down the line in old age, during injury recovery, after surgery, or whenever needed. If you use anabolics, or plan on it, this is also why it's absolutely critical that you do not waste your blast phases with a sh*tty half-assed diet and training regimen if you are not thoroughly knowledgable on how to take full advantage of food, programming, and pharmacology to maximize your progress during your opportunity windows. Maintaining a physique is WAY easier than building it.

    "content": "Should You Use Mouth Tape For Mewing If You Have Sleep Apnea? What Body Position Is Ideal?     Mouth Tape For Mewing Using mouth tape for Mewing has started to pick up in popularity as many are starting to learn about the potential ramifications that mouth breathing can have cosmetically, and on overall health. It's one thing to consciously force yourself to Mew while you're awake, but Mewing while you are sleeping can be nearly impossible if you are not forcing yourself to breathe through your nose.  During my meeting with my ear nose and throat specialist (ENT) I asked whether it would be a good idea or not for people with inhibited nasal passages to use mouth tape to train themsleves to stop mouth breathing. He claims that those who would do that are doing themsleves a disservice, because you are putting unnecessary stress on your body to breathe through your nose when it likely cannot get sufficient oxygen in. You would be sacrificing your health just to force yourself to not use your mouth while sleeping. For those without inhibited nasal passages (no inflamed turbinates or a deviated septum), he encourages the use of mouth tape though, is it would promote the adoption of nasal breathing 24/7, not just during waking hours. Should I resolve my inflamed turbinates, he would then advise I try incorporating mouth tape into my nightly routine, but only once I ensure I can breathe comfortably enough through my nose where it isn't putting my health in jeopardy.  Optimal Sleep Position For Those With Sleep Apnea One thing I've noticed over the years is that my Sleep Apnea seems to be a positioning problem, rather than a signaling problem in my brain. If I fall at my computer desk sitting upright in a chair, I am able to breathe through my nose comfortably. However, if I fall asleep laying on my back, gravity seems to cause my relaxed tongue to fall into my throat, rather than staying against my palate the way it should be. As a result, I only have severe Sleep Apnea when I'm lying on my back, but not in an upright position.  I can actually sleep without my CPAP machine when seated upright. I asked the doctor if he advises his patients to sleep in a specific body position, such as propped up 90 degrees during sleep to avoid gravity induced airway obstruction. The doctor claimed that he usually does not and that 45 degrees, not 90, is the recommended angle for those with sleep apnea. Similar to the angle of a La-Z-Boy reclined chair. Alternatively, he also suggests sleeping your side to prevent the tongue from obstructing the airway. I also asked whether sleeping in a propped-up position as opposed to lying down can have decrease the amount of REM sleep you get. He said no, claiming that the obstruction of the airway is more of the concern rather than the body position itself, and that people with obstructed breathing would find it hard to get to REM sleep anyway. In other words, it is hard to get adequate deep sleep with an obstructed airway, and body position is not nearly as important as ensuring that the airway is clear in general.

    "content": "How To Tell If You Are Mewing Correctly | ENT Doctor’s Opinion     Are you Mewing correctly? While I've watched dozens of instructional videos and read through several articles to make sure I'm not wasting my time with what I thought was the correct way, I wanted to get my ear nose and throat specialist's input to see if it lines up with everything I've learned to date. The general principles I was aware of essentially broke down to maintaining proper body posture, keeping your mouth shut, and applying light pressure, or a suction hold, to the roof of your mouth with your tongue, with the posterior part of the tongue being the most important for encouraging optimal facial development.  Mewing – A Simplified Explanation Although the doctor himself did not specifically answer the question as he had never heard of Mewing, he already adopts and encourages his patients to adopt the same principles behind it, and made an effort to briefly outline to me how to know if you are Mewing correctly.  Using the anatomy of the mouth as an example, he first established two points in it; specifically, the locations of the tongue and the palate. The palate is the roof of the mouth.  Correct tongue posture is achieved with an emphasis on the back of the tongue being firmly placed against the back palate. The middle and tip of your tongue should be suctioned up against the mid and front area of your palate as well, but not too forcefully otherwise it will push the back of your tongue (the more important part) downwards.  The force generated by correct tongue posture should be upwards and forwards, and is mainly driven by the back of the tongue. If the back of the tongue is high enough and firmly pressed against the back palate, your airway in your mouth should feel cut off, and it may even feel uncomfortable. This is normal, and takes getting used to. The biggest mistake people make when trying to learn how to Mew is they will place the tip of their tongue on the roof of their mouth, but then completely or partially neglect the posterior region. Focus on getting the back of your tongue in the right position before you even worry about the middle or the front of the tongue, as they are much less important. As time goes on and Mewing correctly becomes second nature to you, the back of your tongue will be firmly placed far back on your palate, and the rest of your tongue will be suctioned up against the mid and front portions of your palate without touching the back of your front teeth. Another big mistake many make is they will push the tip of their tongue against the back of their front teeth. The front of your tongue should not touch your teeth at all, and should be right behind your gums.

    "content": "Mewing While Exercising And Sleeping | Is It Necessary? | ENT Doctor’s Opinion     My conversation with my ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist continued where we subsequently talked about the potential ramifications mouth-breathing can have on the craniofacial development, and its potential implications relating to my sleep apnea. About a year ago, I started to dive down the rabbit hole of mouth breathing vs nasal breathing with “proper” tongue posture. The evidence supporting why you should breathe through your nose was convincing enough for me to take a serious look at my own airway issues, mainly my nasal congestion and how it forces me to use a full face mask with my CPAP machine every night. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-U5O7HCt0A Even with a significantly impaired nasal passage, Mewing throughout my waking hours is possible, it is just difficult. However, maintaining proper tongue posture and nasal breathing during exercise is impossible for me, and while I'm sleeping its also incredibly difficult as my body has subconsciously trained itself to let gravity drop my tongue into my throat while I sleep. Chronic mouth breathing and bodybuilding is what led to my sleep apnea in the first place, and my tongue posture just compounds the issue and further encourages mouth breathing. My question for my ENT specialist was whether or not Mewing while exercising and sleeping is necessary. He was pretty confident in saying that even for those without inhibited airways, nasal breathing comfortably during very strenuous exercise is impossible. Nasal breathing throughout less demanding exercise is encouraged, but it is not necessary if your exercise demands create oxygen needs that simply can't be met with nasal breathing. Mewing sleeping however is necessary and is encouraged.  Takeaway Although some of us find breathing through the nose a difficult thing to do, breathing through the mouth poses a risk that is not only detrimental to our health, but also to our craniofacial development. Mouth tape while sleeping is encouraged, as is sleeping on your side to prevent gravity from dropping your tongue into your airway and causing sleep apnea. While he did advise me to not use mouth tape, this is because the increased stress and workload created by forcing your body to get enough air in through your nose with an inhibited airway could be dangerous. If I was able to resolve my turbinate inflammation, he said that mouth tape would then become a useful tool to train my body to breathe through my nose while I sleep, and to maintain proper tongue posture at the same time.

    "content": "Turbinate Reduction Vs Deviated Septum Surgery For Mewing? | ENT Doctor’s Opinion     Is turbinate reduction or deviated septum surgery for mewing effective? In a previous discussion we have talked about whether or not my deviated septum or inflamed turbinates is the cause of my mouth breathing. My ear nose and throat (ENT) doctor outlined how septal deviation and inflammation of turbinates compounds inhibition of nasal circulation. As my nasal passage is relatively open on one side or the other throughout the day and seems to switch back and forth every few hours, inflamed turbinates seems to be the more likely root of my issue, with septal deviation contributing to my issue, but not comprising the majority of it. We speculate that by resolving my inflamed turbinates, I could likely comfortably breathe through my nose without significant difficulty, and perhaps even start using a nasal mask with my CPAP machine rather than my full face mask that I've been using for seven years now. There are two surgical procedures that would be worth exploring further. Deviated septum surgery, and turbinate reduction. While I would much rather figure out what is spiking my inflammatory response and removing it from my environment, hearing out my options was still worthwhile, as surgical intervention isn't something I will completely take off the table. My ENT detailed the pros and cons to each option, and what can be expected in general.  Turbinate Reduction Turbinate reduction is a less involving procedure with a lower risk profile and significantly lower recovery time. Apparently, in my case, it would definitely relieve most of the congestion in my right nostril, but it may be less effective in my left nostril because my septum is deviated to that side. I asked the doctor what this “minor” procedure entails exactly. He explained to me that the procedure is in office and only takes half an hour. Under local anesthetic they stick needles into the turbinates on the side of the nose and freeze them up. Afterwards, they put little probes in beside the bone and into the inflamed, hypertrophied areas. Using heat, the turbinates are shrunk down, and then they are pushed away from the middle part of the nose, thereby creating more room for breathing. The recovery period involves at least one week of no heavy lifting or straining, and is followed by 4 to 6 weeks of constant care with saltwater rinsing and flushing to get rid of the crusting that will occur in the nose. There will be an immediate relief in congestion, but that will be followed shortly thereafter by congestion again as swelling and crusting blocks the airway during recovery.  Following that, things will start to get much better again from there as the swelling and crusting subsides. Deviated Septum Surgery Deviated septum surgery would be a far more involving process, whereby they would not only shrink down the turbinates, but forcefully move my septum back into alignment. This procedure takes place in a hospital and has a much longer recovery time. To achieve full nasal congestion relief, this would be the ideal procedure, however, the downtime and involvement of this procedure seemed to outweigh the potential benefit in my case as my inflamed turbinates seem to be the major contributing factor to my congestion, with only a relatively minor amount of airway inhibition occurring in my left nostril as a direct result of my deviated septum. Empty Nose Syndrome I had heard about something called “empty nose syndrome”, which apparently is a major concern post-surgery [R]. Empty nose syndrome can occur when part or all of the turbinate structures attached to the wall of the nose are removed during surgery. The doctor assured me that removing turbinates is no longer a practice used today, unlike the way things were done previously, so empty nose syndrome after either procedure would be impossible with todays technology.

    "content": "Deviated Septum Or Inflamed Turbinates The Cause Of Mouth Breathing? | ENT Doctor’s Opinion On Mewing     Following up on my previous post where I talked about my deviated septum, this topic extends by finding an answer to the cause of my mouth breathing. During my last meeting with my ear nose and throat doctor I asked if the main cause of my mouth breathing was my deviated septum, or the inflammation of my turbinates. In my case, all day one nostril or the other is 80-100% inhibited, and this seems to swap back and forth every few hours. As you would expect, this makes Mewing very difficult, and Mewing while I sleep nearly impossible.  Prior to him explaining how this inflammation response is mediated, I did not truly understand the impact Turbinate hypertrophy has on getting adequate circulation through the nasal passage. I had been told all my life by doctors that my deviated septum was the main issue, and it would likely correct itself with invasive surgery. After this meeting, I realized that this likely is not the case at all. My Inflamed Turbinates Turbinates in the nose are responsible for warming and moistening the air we breathe. The turbinates can become enlarged, and they will grow in response to irritants or allergies.  According to him, irritants include things like smoke, weather changes, barometric pressure changes, etc. And allergens include things like molds, grasses, etc. But the big question is what really causes the blockage in my nose and why does it shift back and forth? Is it really because of my deviated septum, or a case of my turbinates getting extremely inflamed? The fact that one of my nostrils always has decent circulation while the other is almost completely blocked, coupled with the fact that this blockage swaps back and forth over the course of the day, every single day, leads me to believe that the root of my mouth breathing is mainly caused by inflamed turbinates in response to some unknown environmental allergen or irritant. There is no logical reason why a deviated septum would cause swapping airway inhibition over the day as it is deviated to one side and remains there. So, I had uncovered the root of my issue, but now comes the challenge of discovering what irritant or allergen is triggering my inflammatory response. An elaborate allergy test would be justified, and probably an extensive assessment of my work/living environment as well to check for any kind of molds or potential triggers. Turbinate Reduction Vs Deviated Septum Surgery I had almost gone through with deviated septum surgery in the past, but now I'm glad I hadn't, as I truly believe turbinate inflammation is the major cause of my issue. Surgical intervention for a deviated septum is very invasive, and doesn't seem overly necessary in my case based on what I now know. While I am more interested in finding out what is triggering my inflammation in the first place and removing it so I can naturally alleviate my issue, I was still interested in hearing the potential surgical interventions designed to deal with this problem. My ENT detailed how a turbinate reduction procedure would shrink my enlarged turbinates, and likely significantly alleviate my airway inhibition on my right side, but perhaps less significantly on my left side as that is the side my deviated septum is bent towards.  By reducing the inflammation in my turbinates, I believe I would be able to Mew much more comfortably, and perhaps even start to incorporate mouth tape into my sleeping routine. I have extreme obstructive sleep apnea, so mouth tape is probably too dangerous for me to use right now until I address my turbinate inflammation. However, knowing how to go about addressing turbinate inflammation (and being aware of its existence in the first place) now potentially opens up a whole new way for me to not only circumvent my circulation issues, but to allow me to maintain proper tongue posture 24/7, and maybe even get rid of my sleep apnea down the line.

    "content": "Can a Chiropractor Fix a Deviated Septum? | ENT Doctor’s Opinion     Can a Chiropractor fix a deviated septum? Some of my followers told me not to get deviated septum surgery and to seek out a Chiropractor instead. Supposedly, they can just snap your nose back into place, and you can avert having to go through surgery entirely. This seemed a bit farfetched to me, so I asked for my ear nose and throat doctor's opinion on the matter. As some of you may or may not know, I've been dealing with a deviated septum for the majority of my life. In addition to inflamed turbinates, my septal deviation just compounds my airway inhibition, and prevents me from breathing through my nose easily. A deviated septum is a condition where the tissue that separates both the left and right airways of the nose is off-center.  This means that, instead of straight, the septum itself is bent towards either left or right, which can inhibit the otherwise smooth airflow through the nose. In my case, I have been encountering nearly 100% airway inhibition in one nostril or the other nearly all day long, and this inhibition seems to switch sides every few hours. The cause of this I have since discovered is the inflammation of my turbinates, which is the root of the majority of my issue. I asked my ENT about my options for fixing my deviated septum. I already knew about the surgery route, but I also asked “can a chiropractor fix a deviated septum”? If so, it would avert the need for an invasive procedure like septal surgery.  Basically, the idea of putting the treatment in the hands of a chiropractor instead of an ENT originally derives from those who believe that this anatomical disorder can be fixed through mere re-aligning of the bones in the nose. My ENT doctor was straight to the point in saying that, for a case that is not necessarily bone-related, a treatment for a deviated septum is most often—if not always—a subject for surgery. Not wanting to leave any confusion, he outlined how bones work; and how a chiropractic approach would relate to its mechanics. The ENT detailed how a condition involving a deviated septum is not treated with just the re-fracturing of the bones within the nose itself. The nasal passage is also comprised of Cartilage. Cartilage is not something you can fracture and straighten like with bones, hence why a Chiropractor, in almost all cases, would not be able to correct a deviated septum.

    "content": "Half The Female Population Uses A Nandrolone Analog For Birth Control | Deca Only Cycle     A rabbit hole I've been going down over the past few months is the Deca only cycle, synthetic progestins, and Nandrolone analogs. Something right in front of our faces is the fact that women are being prescribed a Nandrolone analog for contraception. “The progestins found in hormonal contraceptives are most commonly a derivative of 19-nortestosterone progestin” [R]. One progestin that is commonly prescribed to women as birth control is Levonorgestrel. Also known as 17α-Ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone. Sounds familiar right? 19-nortestosterone is Nandrolone. If your girl is on birth control, there is a high likelihood that she is either using this drug, or another similar analog. Even the “Morning After Pill” (Plan B) is literally just a mega-dose of Levonorgestrel. Taking this into consideration, it sheds more light on the potential therapeutic applications Nandrolone (or its analogs) could have in men, and opens up a whole new area of data we can refer to, as these Nandrolone analogs have been extensively studied in humans.

Nandrolone is most commonly found in the bodybuilding community as a performance enhancing/muscle building agent. It has a more ideal level of tissue selectivity than Testosterone. While Nandrolone can have a multitude of esters attached to it, the most popular is Nandrolone Decanoate, which is just Nandrolone with a Decanoate ester attached to it. It is commonly just called “Deca” in the bodybuilding community. I've discussed the potential therapeutic promise of Deca in a hair loss prevention context before in previous videos.  Male Hormonal Contraceptives The 19-nor's are among the most suppressive steroids out there, and expectedly, they seem to be the prime candidates of interest when it comes to potential male hormonal contraceptives. While being preoccupied researching things like Nandrolone and Trestolone, I was completely overlooking the fact that the same principles apply to female contraception in many regards. And by reverse engineering their current therapeutic treatments, you can start to piece together more information that is applicable to us. There is a significantly greater amount of human data on female contraceptives than there is on many of the steroids we try to research about, and some of the information is very relevant and insightful to reference. Progestins are the candidate of choice when it comes to female contraception, and it isn't surprising that in male contraceptive research the involvement of a progestin seems necessary to facilitate the most consistent success rate as well. Even among the more cutting edge compounds in development like the Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) S23, infertility could not be consistently achieved with S23 and Estradiol, and it is speculated that the use of a progestin would be necessary to achieve 100% infertility consistently. The Use Of Nandrolone Analogs As Birth Control https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu11uty__OY Now, speaking of progestins and their role as contraceptives, among females specifically, one of the most common compounds prescribed is Levonorgestrel. Doctors will prescribe this drug freely without much hesitation, even to teenage girls. If your girlfriend is on birth control, there is a high probability that she is on a Nandrolone analog.  Expectedly, it is more tissue selective than Testosterone, just like Nandrolone, so it features a more favorable level of anabolic to androgenic activity [R].  In addition, contraception can be achieved with dosages much lower than would be required to induce significant virilization (androgenic activity), hence why it has such a promising clinical profile as a contraceptive agent for women. Decreased Libido On Birth Control (Nandrolone Analogs) Many women experience a decrease in libido after starting Progestins, and this comes down to two factors.  Estrogen, and androgen load.  By shutting down the body, which is the point of taking birth control, you also shut down your body’s endogenous sex hormone production, which is otherwise essential for facilitating several physiological functions. Women using only progestins for birth control with no exogenous Estradiol are essentially the equivalent of men walking around on a very low dose Deca only cycle with no Estrogen. Sufficient Estrogen levels are needed not just for the maintenance of bone mineral density and a variety of other basic functions in the body, but for the maintenance of libido as well. Sufficient androgen levels are needed to support libido in women too, which is fulfilled normally via Testosterone and DHT production. In addition, because the synthetic progestins used for birth control are tissue selective and so suppressive at very low dosages, the androgen load on the body is so low in many cases that in some women who do use it with exogenous Estradiol, their overall androgen load is still insufficient to support a high sex drive. Basically, even if there is enough Estrogen, the dosage of the progestin will likely still yield less androgenic activity in the body than a woman's natural Testosterone production would have otherwise, consequently leading to a decreased libido. The issue boils down to the dose of the compound used for contraception, and the maintenance of healthy amounts of Estrogen. Progestin Use In Conjunction With Exogenous Estradiol Exogenous Estradiol use comes with an inherent risk of increased potential cardiovascular issues, which is partly why it isn't always prescribed with the synthetic progestin being used for contraception. But, the issue with that is that Estrogen is needed for a healthy libido, so girls will commonly experience a massive drop in sexual desire after starting birth control. For example, Alesse 28 is one of the popular brands of birth control commonly prescribed to women. Each pill of Alesse contains 0.10 mg of Levonorgestrel and 0.02 mg of Ethinyl Estradiol. The first birth control pill, Enovid, hit the market in 1960 and contained 0.075 mg of Mestranol, which is a biologically inactive prodrug of Ethinylestradiol.  Ethinylestradiol is about 1.7 times as orally potent by weight as Mestranol, meaning Enovid had over 2 times as much active Estrogen per pill. Enovid was associated much more closely with serious complications like cardiovascular issues, and is why combination pills containing Estrogen are not always prescribed. Despite the fact that Estrogen is needed to maintain a healthy libido, cardiovascular risk will obviously supercede the maintenance of libido for individuals who are seen as high-risk. However, this is where this conversation starts to tie directly back into the Deca only cycle debate. Deca Only Cycle Limitations The reason the Deca only cycle fails is typically not related to androgen load, as most men exploring this avenue use 19-nortestosterone at doses far higher than is needed to support a healthy libido in an androgen context. In the instances when they do fail, the reason is almost always the lack of sufficient Estradiol levels, as Nandrolone does not aromatize into a sufficient amount of Estradiol at therapeutic dosages. I explored this for myself, and found that even with the concurrent administration of Estradiol cream onto my scalp (for a hair loss experiment) I still could not maintain adequate levels of Estradiol in my body while on 200 mg of Nandrolone.  This is a dose that should be more than enough in a hormone replacement therapy context, but it simply does not produce enough Estrogen to be considered a viable form of HRT monotherapy. This is why a Deca only cycle must have some form of Estrogen added in to maintain adequate Estrogen levels in the body in most cases. This limitation is the same reason why birth control pills contain a combination of hormones in them, a progestin and Ethinylestradiol. The only reason why women who take a synthetic progestin for birth control do not experience masculinization as a side effect essentially boils down to the dosage and the low androgen load it has at that dosage while still maintaining infertility. Nandrolone Analogs Being Handed Out Like Candy By Doctors The thing I find most baffling about all of this is how easily women, even young teenage girls, can get a birth control prescription.  Meanwhile, men who are actually hormonally deficient going in to try and get hormone replacement therapy of the actual hormone their body should be producing higher amounts of are scorned and given an extremely difficult time getting what they need. looking for hormone replacement therapy, on the other hand, would find it hard to get TRT at any given age, due to the ridiculousness of the medical system. If you have a 35 year old hypogonadal man walk in to the doctors office and a 16 year old girl walk into the doctors office, the man is the hormonally deficient one of the two, and is actually seeking to get a prescription for a legitimate medical problem that significantly hinders his quality of life, and the prescription is literally the hormone is body should be producing. But, what is the typical outcome of those two scenarios? The 16 year old girl walks out with a prescription for a Nandrolone analog, meanwhile the man is told he should take Viagra or Cialis for his non functional dick and he is too young to be having these issues. Does that make any f*cking sense to you? If I walked into the doctors office and said I want to be prescribed Nandrolone and Estradiol for birth control, they would laugh me out of the office. Even if you're legitimately hormonally deficient and ask for Testosterone replacement therapy, if you're not 65 years old and withering away in front of their eyes they will probably assume you just want a prescription for steroids and will more often than not tell you you're fine and to leave. If a chick who knows absolutely nothing about hormones walks in and asks for birth control, without even looking at her baseline blood work they would hand her a prescription with several refills on it for a synthetic Nandrolone analog, which is NOT a bioidentical hormone and is not something your body even produces, or is deficient in ever. If I was a girl and wanted to transition from female to male though and said that I want a Testosterone prescription, I would have a higher likelihood of getting a prescription from most doctors than I would walking around in my 20's hypogonadal trying to obtain a TRT script from most doctors. There is absolutely zero logic in the medical community when it comes to hormone modulation. Women on birth control are essentially walking around on a micro-dosed Deca only cycle for years, sometimes decades, until they decide they want to stop, come off, and have a kid. Birth Control Implants And Injections Doctors will often administer long lasting progestin injections, or progestin releasing implants too.   A teenage girl can walk into a doctors office and get a rod inserted into her arm that releases Etonogestrel (11-Methylene-17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone) into her body for the next 3 years, but you can't get a Testosterone prescription because you just want steroids you greasy juice monkey. One of the main problems with haphazardly prescribing these steroids to women (yes, birth control is technically a steroid) is that there is no baseline blood work, and when a sexual side effect arises, nobody has a clue what the problem is because Estrogen modulation and androgen load in the body are not even considered. Typically, if a girl has a low sex drive, it can be attributed to her birth control, or general lack of hormone modulation. I've seen dozens of relationships ruined over the improper management of sex hormones, and often the girl or guy in the relationship will start to blame themselves, or their partner, because they assume that they must be the issue, and fail to consider the fact that their hormone profile is a disaster. Now, this may come across as me frowning upon birth control, and that's not necessarily the case, rather I'm simply trying to make clear how to address hormonal issues should they arise as a result of progestin usage. What Does This Mean For Deca Only Cycle Advocates And Critics? Nandrolone with Estradiol may be a safer form of hormone replacement therapy than many assume, as most of the female population seems to live on it for decades. In men, the switch from Testosterone to Nandrolone is usually prompted by the desire to avoid androgenic side effects like hair loss, which is a reasonable justification in my opinion. Granted, Nandrolone (and any AAS) is not hair loss safe by any means, but the pharmacology of Nandrolone is certainly more ideal in that regard. Nandrolone's superior myotrophic to androgenic ratio of tissue selectivity would also allow a male to use a lower dose of drugs per week to maintain the same amount of muscle mass that would otherwise require a higher dose of Testosterone to maintain. If it is generally regarded as safe for a girl to walk around for decades on a synthetic Nandrolone analog, then why is it so frowned upon when men choose to use the literal bioidentical progestin our bodies actually create (albeit in trace amounts)? Before you dive head first into a Deca only cycle, remember, the dose makes the poison. Women are using such a low dosage of progestins that they don't even induce any virilization in the body, and the studies conducted on Nandrolone analogs mostly evaluate it at what are considered therapeutic doses in women for contraception. The long-term potential ramifications of Nandrolone use in a hormone replacement therapy context at the doses required to maintain male physiological functions remain unknown, however, the confidence the medical community seems to have in Nandrolone analogs is certainly promising and further solidifies its potential safety and efficacy profile in my opinion.

    "content": "How Many Days Per Week I Workout To Maintain My Physique     I used to be religious about hitting 5-6 workouts per week to maintain my physique. This was at a time when I was hardcore into bodybuilding and assumed that any less than that would cause my physique to whither away. This was also the same time that I assumed that I needed 200 mg per week of Testosterone for my TRT or else I would lose everything I had gained over the years. During those times, I would go to the gym 5 or 6 days a week, minimum. I was so consistent that I wouldn't even miss a workout when I had the flu and felt like dog sh*t. As time went on and my free time became more and more limited as a result of increased work demands, I started to hit the gym less and less. At first I dropped down to 4 or 5 days per week. Then I dropped to 4. Then I dropped to 3. I have now stuck with 3 days per week for a while. I started to realize that I was able to maintain my physique and was not regressing at all, despite my lowered weekly volume. I was working out half as frequently as I was previously, and my physique didn't change at all. This is when I started to truly realize that when it comes to muscle maintenance, less can be more. The demands your body has to gain muscle are different than your demands for muscle maintenance, and I started to realize this as I lowered my TRT dosage, and lowered my training volume. Nothing changed when I cut my volume in half, not for better and not for worse. It had been grilled into my brain that I needed to be in the gym on a nearly daily basis. Hell, if IFBB pros are training twice per day, then surely I should at least be in there 5 days a week to maintain my physique I thought to myself. My previous assumptions about training were thrown out the window at that point, and I started to realize that it was actually possible to maintain my physique lifting weights for no more than 3-4 hours total per week, which would have seemed absolutely insane to me years ago.  However, it should be noted that this is not necessarily ideal if you are actively trying to gain as much muscle as possible. Gain As Much Muscle As Possible As Young As Possible I encourage you to build as much muscle as you can as young as possible. The reason for this being that after going through puberty your body is primed to build maximum amounts of muscle, and this amount will slowly decline over the coming years. Not just via the decrease in endogenous androgen production that you will inevitably experience with age, but just cellular breakdown in general. Recovery and muscle building becomes harder and harder the older you get. In addition, the clinical data suggests that a muscle can gain myonuclei and never loses it, ever [R]. That means that any myonuclei (the nuclei of a muscle fiber or cell) gained throughout your younger years where accruing muscle is exponentially easier will stick around even in old age, and consequently allow you to retain a lot more muscle in old age than you would otherwise. This is essentially what muscle memory boils down to. Build A Bank Of Myonuclei I'm sure you've experienced muscle memory at one point or another in your life. You take some time off for an injury, or because you were sick, or you just needed a break, you lose some size, but then when you get back on a strict regimen you get back to where you plateaued last relatively quickly. This is muscle memory. But this “memory” extends far beyond just the idea that you can get lost gains back quick after an injury. It implies that if you build up a bank of myonuclei in your youth when you are the most primed to build lean muscle mass, you can then draw on that “bank” to maintain a muscular physique with far greater ease as you get older. When endogenous androgen levels are at their highest and your body is primed for recovery simply via being young, you can build up a huge bank of myonuclei that you can then benefit from later in life when gaining muscle will be a much more difficult endeavour. The same principle extends to exogenous anabolic hormone use, as you could build up a bank of myonuclei that would have otherwise been impossible to accrue with natural endogenous androgen levels, and then benefit from that for years to come when building that same physique would have been extremely difficult. Kevin Levrone is a great example of this. He built up an incredible physique in his youth, and then took years off of bodybuilding entirely. Kevin Levrone before working out, in his prime, and then after retiring from bodybuilding Then when he decided to get back in shape, within short order he blew back up and took full advantage of that myonuclei bank (muscle memory) he had accrued throughout his youth. Kevin Levrone in his prime vs 19 years later after coming out of retirement If Kevin tried to build that physique from scratch in 2016, there is no way he would have even come close. When you are in your prime in your youth you will be the least vulnerable to sickness, disease, cardiovascular health complications and hair loss. This is where accruing as much lean tissue as possible is ideal, as you can then go on to build on that later if you desire, or just maintain it with ease as you get older, which I think is the more ideal outcome. Build your physique when your body is most capable of avoiding negative ramifications, and then remove those stressors as you get older and reap the rewards of maintaining a phenomenal physique with minimal stress on your body. In a performance enhancing context (if you aren't natural), obviously gaining muscle with hormone use is not healthy at any age, but I think if someone is dead set on building a physique that is not attainable naturally, they would be best served by getting there as quick as possible when their body is most capable of packing on that muscle. After the foundation is built, they can then remove those stressors so then they can enjoy the fruits of their labor with minimal stress on the body, minimal hormone use, and potentially even minimal training in the gym if desired. This goes back to my statement where I stress the importance of making the most of each bulking phase and milking them for muscle gain while you are capable of it. And if you are using exogenous hormones, DO NOT waste your blasts! In addition, aside from the obvious performance and body composition benefits of building up a strong bank of myonuclei, it will significantly offset the likelihood of musculoskeletal degenerative disease in old age.

    "content": "Oral Castor Oil for Hair Loss Prevention?     Oral castor oil is something not thoroughly explored in the hair loss community, despite a significant amount of promising data backing its potential efficacy. Typically, castor oil is topically applied. In practical application, its effect on hair loss prevention topically seems to be minimal when it comes to dealing with androgenic alopecia as opposed to a skin condition. To get adequate absorption through the scalp you would need to mix castor oil with DMSO, or keep it on your scalp almost all day. And even with this, topical absorption is subpar relative to oral castor oil ingestion. The component of castor oil that was found to potentially be hair protective is the Ricinoleic acid found within castor oil itself. Ricinoleic acid induces formation of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and acts as a potent agonist of EP3 and EP4 receptors [R, R]. In theory, this could help relieve hair follicle hypoxia by antagonizing the tissue constricting effects of Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in the scalp [R].   Table of Contents ToggleWhat is PGD2 and PGE2?PGE2 Protection Against Radiation-induced Hair LossPGE2 And Castor Oil To Induce LaborCastor Oil As A LaxativeCastor Oil and Hair LossMega Dosage of Castor Oil and Its Effect on Hair GrowthMinoxidil And Oral Castor Oil As Growth AgonistsKnown Factors of Hair LossMy View On Oral Castor Oil For Hair Loss PreventionIs PGE2 More Effective Than Castor Oil?Where To Buy Food Grade Castor OilRelated What is PGD2 and PGE2? Without going too deep into the topic, PGD2 and PGE2 are physiologically active lipid compounds that are categorized as prostaglandins. Prostaglandins exhibit diverse hormone-like properties and are found abundantly in human tissues, such as the organs. At their most basic, PGD2 causes the constriction of tissues in the body, while PGE2 does the complete opposite by inducing tissue relaxation [R]. PGE2 and PGD2 more or less counterregulatory hormones of one another. PGE2 Protection Against Radiation-induced Hair Loss PGE2 was found to prevent radiation induced hair loss in a rodent model [R].  Although it has not been tested on humans, the data suggests that a favorable ratio of PGE2 to PGD2 has significant hair protective benefits. In cancer patients that would otherwise lose their hair, PGE2 has the potential to protect them from radiation-induced hair loss. In theory, castor oil could potentially facilitate the same hair protective benefits. PGE2 And Castor Oil To Induce Labor PGE2 is commonly used to induce labor [R]. The mechanism by which it facilitates this is by relaxing smooth muscles, softening the cervix and causing uterine contractions. Studies have noted that PGE2 is hair protective, and PGD2 inhibits hair growth [R]. Notably, castor oil is also used to induce labor [R].  The ingestion of the Ricinoleic acid in castor oil induces formation of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and acts as a potent agonist of EP3 and EP4 receptors, consequently facilitating the same labor induction effects of pure PGE2. Another interesting thing to note is that, this belief is more than just conceptual. It’s actually being deployed as a medical practice. For example, if a woman desired to give birth on a specific date, they may be prescribed PGE2 in conjunction with a large dose of castor oil. As for the dosage, women are given upwards of 4 tablespoons (60 mL) of castor oil for labor induction. Castor Oil As A Laxative Castor oil is most commonly used as a laxative. It is a treatment for constipation, and works the same way it induces labor. Smooth muscle relaxation helps alleviate constipation and encourage a bowel movement. As a laxative, doses above 5 mL are commonly used, although many will assert that anything above a 2 mL daily dose will cause the same laxative effects. Castor Oil and Hair Loss So how castor oil is used against hair loss? Understanding that the mechanism by which PGE2 works starts to shed some light on how the cascade of events leading to hair follicle miniaturization occurs. PGE2 relaxes tissues in the body, hence why it works to induce labor and as a laxative, and also why it is also potentially hair protective. It relaxes the tissue that would otherwise be constricting hair follicles and potentially causing follicular hypoxia. For inducing labor, doses upwards of 60 mL of castor oil are used. As a laxative, doses upwards of 5-15 mL of castor oil are used. In a hair loss prevention context, doses of 0.5-2 mL of castor oil per day have proved to be sufficient, and it is theorized that 2 mL is where diminishing returns sets in. The tolerability of castor oil consumption on a daily basis more or less boils down to digestion and gut health. Right off the bat, one major complaint that some report with oral castor oil consumption to treat hair loss is that it causes an upset stomach. I know guys who can handle upwards of 5 mL per day with no issues, and I know guys who can't even consume 0.5 mL per day without massive digestive stress. This is a relatively obscure potential treatment, so proceed with caution. There are not many studies we can refer to to assess its safety and tolerability when it comes to long-term usage, as this is ultimately what we would be interested in in a hair loss prevention capacity. Data outlining its tolerability as a laxative shed light on its safety in the short term, but for daily use at micro-doses for years on end, that remains to be seen. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization and World Health Organization, up to 0.7 mg/kg of castor oil orally per day is safe for men [R]. Oral castor oil is also generally recognized as safe and effective for use as a stimulant laxative by the FDA [R]. Mega Dosage of Castor Oil and Its Effect on Hair Growth One of my close friends started taking 5 mL per day for beard growth. While he's not particularly concerned with hair loss prevention, the results he reports are still useful to reference as the mechanism by which beard hair growth is facilitated is not different than on the scalp, it just doesn't have a cascade of hypoxia triggering factors causing miniaturization like on the scalp via androgens.  This friend of mine, who was the subject of his own experiment, noticed a positive result in just a couple weeks. The sides of his beard had become significantly less patchy, his beard had become thicker in general, he had grown hairs in areas which did not have any hair growth before, and his beard is now darker as well. It should be noted that I don't recommend using this high of a dose, but it is insightful to reference his results at 5 mL nonetheless. Minoxidil And Oral Castor Oil As Growth Agonists Minoxidil is commonly used to increase beard hair growth. If something works to increase beard hair growth, you can logically conclude it would likely have a similar effect on the scalp as a growth agonist.   For those who did not know, one of Minoxidil’s side effects is hair growth everywhere in the body [R, R]. This isn't common with topical Minoxidil as it more or less stays localized to its area of application and only is partially systemically absorbed, but with oral Minoxidil (Loniten) hair growth everywhere is reported in almost all users. Oral castor oil seems to facilitate this systemic increase in hair growth, but without the negative cardiovascular effects that Minoxidil is associated with. The reason why is that both of these compounds increase circulation to the scalp, thereby alleviating the follicular miniaturization occurring in the tissue. Ultimately, these are both just bandaids for the root of the issue (endogenous androgens), but at the end of the day, the more tissue relaxation and circulation you can promote the better for antagonizing the constricting effects triggered by androgenic hormones in the body. The mechanism by which they accomplish this likely differ, as Minoxidil mainly works by opening up the potassium channels in the body, while oral castor oil works by inducing the formation of PGE2 and acting on the some of the same receptors as PGE2. However, Minoxidil's mechanism of action isn't fully understood either, and a lot of the data actually suggests that it doesn't just work by opening up the potassium channels more, but it also may have an anti-androgen like effect, and it may even be a PGE2 agonist in itself too [R, R]. Known Factors of Hair Loss While nobody definitively knows what the full cascade of events is in the body that lead to follicular miniaturization, it seems that androgens are a catalyst for scalp tissue changes that ultimately lead to poor circulation and cumulative hypoxia. Ultimately, poor circulation and the presence of androgens go hand in hand, and interventions that increase scalp tissue circulation all seem to have positive effects on hair growth. Hence, the most effective treatments for staving off further miniaturization would include compounds that antagonize the effects of androgens either at the androgen receptor itself, or systemically. My View On Oral Castor Oil For Hair Loss Prevention Some reputable sites seem to deem that castor oil is safe to consume long-term [R]. However, I am still wary of any potential long-term ramifications it could have on gut health in particular, and will proceed with caution. Its potential efficacy is promising, as it evidently has a profound antagonizing effect against the tissue-constricting effects of PGD2, and is seen in the medical community as one of the go to agents to facilitate this. Anecdotally, it seems to be one of the most promising growth agonists in a hair loss prevention context with a fairly low risk profile. I will be experimenting with 1 mL per day myself, and will make a judgment after I've given it a fair chance as to whether or not I think it holds its own to justify its use in a hair loss prevention capacity for most men. Is PGE2 More Effective Than Castor Oil? We already know that the way castor oil facilitates its potential benefits in a hair loss prevention context is via the formation of PGE2 and activation of some of the same receptors as PGE2. So if that is the case, then why don't we just apply PGE2 to our heads and be done with it? Well, in practical application, while it seems to have some positive effect, it isn't enough to stave off androgenic alopecia. However, it certainly doesn't hurt, and many individuals I know have noted that oral castor oil gave them better results than topical application of pure PGE2. The problem with straight PGE2 is that PGE2 dosages are extremely small and measured in micrograms, making it very difficult to make an accurately dosed solution that doesn't overload your scalp with excessive PGE2, and the potential ramifications of that are unknown. PGE2 is also cost prohibitive, whereas castor oil is dirt cheap, seems to facilitate much of the same effects at a fraction of the price, and there is a lot of data supporting the safety of the consumption of castor oil at dosages far exceeding what someone would consume in a hair loss prevention context. Consuming a small dose of ricinoleic acid as a precursor to PGE2 also gives your body a chance to regulate how much PGE2 is formed, whereas with straight PGE2 application you are forcing your body to deal with a giant hit of PGE2. The potential contraindications of PGE2 use are worrying as well, as it is directly tied to the promotion of cancerous tumour growth [R]. Where To Buy Food Grade Castor Oil You want to buy 100% castor oil, not Jamaican black castor oil. It's clear and a pale yellow color. Food/Pharma grade (USP or BP) is ideal as it ensures a high enough standardization of Ricinoleic acid. Ricinoleic acid is the component of castor oil that boosts PGE2 and we care about. NOW Solutions Castor Oil is third party tested and meets our criteria for a high quality Castor Oil, and is also what I use personally.

    "content": "My IGF-1 Level On 3 IU Of Pharma Grade GH     Many bodybuilders seeking hyperplasia and enhanced lipolysis use GH (HGH/human growth hormone). Even individuals just seeking anti-aging benefits have started to incorporate GH into their hormone replacement therapy protocols. Most of these individuals have no idea what their IGF-1 levels actually are as a result of the amount of GH they are using. I've spent thousands of dollars on blood work, and I felt it would be insightful for many to see what a fairly typical IGF-1 level is on 3 IU of pharma grade GH. What is IGF-1? IGF-1 stands for “Insulin-like Growth Factor-1,” also known as Somatomedin C, is a hormone produced primarily in the liver, which shares a similar chemical structure to insulin. IGF-1 production is stimulated by GH, hence why individuals seeking to increase their IGF-1 levels inject GH to facilitate its production in the liver. IGF-1 Level Effect On Growth GH is made in the anterior pituitary gland, and after being released into the blood stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1.  IGF-1 then stimulates systemic body growth, and is largely what facilitates the growth spurt children experience as they go through puberty.  Peak average serum IGF-1 levels during puberty are roughly around 380 ng/mL, and these levels sharply decline after puberty.  A child who is deficient in Growth Hormone (and consequently IGF-1 in most cases), will experience hindered growth during puberty. One of the most prominent examples of this was when Lionel Messi was diagnosed with a Growth Hormone deficiency as a child, and received treatment at age 13. If he had not received treatment, he likely would have never grown to a normal height. IGF-1 Level On 3 IU GH  Back when I was obsessed with bodybuilding, I used GH to try and induce hyperplasia and splice new muscle cells, as well as stay leaner while I bulked up in the off-season. I had a blood test on 3 IU of high quality GH that revealed that my IGF-1 level was 489 ng/mL.  The reference range is 98-282 ng/mL, so 3 IU had me almost double the high end of the therapeutic reference range. This IGF-1 level is literally in acromegaly territory, and would certainly expose someone to some level of long-term consequences if this dosage were used year round, for many years on end [R]. The most notable of these potential complications would be insulin resistance and severe cardiovascular complications [R, R]. IGF-1 Level In Active Acromegaly Patients Vs The Self Imposed IGF-1 Level Of Bodybuilders Below you can see for yourself what the IGF-1 level in a normal person vs someone with active Acromegaly is [R].     Remission Group Active Group     n = 61 n = 77 p-value     Age (yr) mean (range) 52.7 ± 10.7 46 ± 13.5 0.0007   Gender (F/M) 29/32 32/45 0.49   IGF-1 (ng/ml) 173 ± 49 595 ± 211    GH Fasting (µg/L) 0.92 ± 1.16 20 ± 37 <0.0001   GH Nadir OGTT (µg/L) 0.25 ± 0.25 14 ± 25 <0.0001    In the bodybuilding community, 3 IU is commonly seen as an anti-aging dose. 4 IU and above is seen as a “muscle building” dose. As you can see, the active group with untreated Acromegaly had IGF-1 levels as low as 384 ng/mL, and as high as 806 ng/mL. Think about how much systemic growth occurs during puberty, and then think about how the IGF-1 level required to yield that growth is only around the same amount of IGF-1 that the very low end of Acromegaly patients produce year round. By using only 3 IU of high quality GH, I was quite literally imposing on myself the same potential complications that Acromegaly patients are vulnerable to. It isn't uncommon for bodybuilders to use 4-8 IU per day, and even more in some cases, for years on end. Accompanied by the excessive amounts of muscle and anabolic steroids they use, you can logically conclude how health complications can become a very real concern very quickly for many bodybuilders as young as their 30's and 40's, and sometimes as young as their 20's. Caveat Keep in mind, my blood test result is just a reference at the end of the day. Different individuals will produce significantly different amounts of IGF-1 with the same dose of GH just based on their own genetics, liver function, and several other factors. But, there aren't many individuals publishing their blood test results, and as a rough point of reference this is more or less what can be expected with high quality GH. Is this amount of GH sustainable in the short-term without encountering health debilitating side effects? For most healthy individuals, probably. Is walking around with an IGF-1 level in Acromegaly range sustainable year round, for years on end though without some sort of hindrance to your health? For most individuals, I would assume the answer is no.

    "content": "Are SARMs Actually Side Effect Free? Or Are They Just As Bad As Steroids?     Are SARMs side effect free? Also known as the Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators, SARMs are tissue selective anabolic agents designed with the intention of replicating the anabolic effects of steroids in muscle tissue and bone without the androgenicity in other affected tissues. On paper, SARMs have a distinct advantage in terms of tissue selectivity, androgen-receptor specificity, and apparent lack of side effects that are otherwise commonly experienced with anabolic steroid use. Anabolic steroids can cause various adverse effects in the human body, most notably deriving from their androgenicity. Side effects like hair loss on the scalp, acne flare ups, hair growth on the body, infertility, among several others can all occur with steroid use. These side effects are even more pronounced in females because of their Estrogen dominant hormone profile. Even a mild increase in the androgen index in women can result in male-like manifestations like hirsutism and deepening of the voice. Obviously, the therapeutic potential of SARMs is incredibly promising. They are designed to provide the same muscle growth as Testosterone, but without any of the negative androgenic side effects that would occur with exogenous androgen use. However, SARMs aren't without their own issues, despite what many advocates will repeatedly state.

One group will tell you that SARMs are side effect free steroid alternatives, and the other group will tell you that SARMs suck and are useless. Now, to be clear, SARMs DO bind with a high affinity to the androgen receptor, they DO transcribe tissue-selective anabolic effects via androgen receptor activation, and they DO work. They are not side effect free though. The Misinterpretation Of SARMs Studies When you actually get into the data of what a SARM is to begin with, you will quickly realize that this “tissue selective” category of anabolic agents is fairly general, and compounds of varying levels of efficacy will be lumped into the same category as one another. Basically, effective SARMs are lumped into the same category as poor SARMs, simply because they all have a better anabolic to androgenic activity ratio than Testosterone. The reference androgen used to evaluate the efficacy of a SARM is Testosterone. The problem with that is that Testosterone is not tissue selective at all. It's 5 alpha-reduced into a far more androgenic metabolite, DHT. In the medical community, Testosterone is seen as a subpar treatment for musculoskeletal degenerative diseases because of its androgenic activity in the body. Anabolic steroids were designed for this very purpose, and the pursuit of synthesizing anabolic steroids with greater levels of efficacy than Testosterone was fueled by the therapeutic limitations of Testosterone in a clinical setting. If an old frail woman comes in with a muscle wasting disease, while slamming her with Testosterone will probably help prevent further muscle loss, it will inevitably lead to horrible masculinizing side effects. Clearly you can see where the limitations of steroids lie in this capacity. Clinical studies use the anabolic to androgenic tissue selectivity of Testosterone as the benchmark for SARMs, which frankly, is not very good. If you have an anabolic agent with superior tissue selectivity to Testosterone, that doesn't mean it is free of some level of androgenic activity itself. For example, if SARM #1 has a 500:1 level of tissue selectivity, but SARM #2 has a 4:1 level of tissue selectivity, they will both be categorized as “SARMs” in the clinical data. You can imagine how misleading this ends up being when this information is poorly interpreted and regurgitated. Both are SARMs and are tissue selective relative to Testosterone, but are they equal to one another in efficacy? Not even close. MENT And Trenbolone Have SARM-Like Actions Looking at the clinical data, you'll see things like MENT (Trestolone) and Trenbolone, being referred to for their SARM-like characteristics. Trenbolone, despite being a very potent anabolic androgenic steroid, is described as “SARM-like” because of its level of tissue selectivity relative to Testosterone [R]. Just because an anabolic compound milligram per milligram may be more efficacious than testosterone, it's still going to induce androgenic effects at some level, and this is dependent on the chemical makeup of the compound in question and how it interacts with the androgen receptor. All things considered, there are tons of different factors to take into account here, but the point is that SARMs are not free of androgenic activity as they are often implied to. As the efficacy of SARMs is nuanced—meaning, some are better or worse than others—one common issue with this particular class of compounds is many of them negatively affect many of the same health markers as traditional anabolic steroids. The Two Polar Opposite Arguments For And Against SARMs The main problem with SARMs comes from the lack of accurate information coming from both camps of individuals. Both the advocates and the critics of SARMs disseminate incorrect information constantly, and it leaves the general public who have interest in this niche completely clueless as to who to believe. When the “gurus” and “experts” in the industry don't even know what the hell they're talking about, how can you possibly make an informed decision? You can't, unless you delve into the data yourself and make an educated conclusion, because the “gurus” sure as hell aren't interpreting the data correctly before they hop on social media and parrot to the masses about how great (or how horrible) SARMs are and why. Side Effects Of SARMs Currently In Clinical Trials Here's the deal, there are only a handful of SARMs being pushed through pharmaceutical pipelines in clinical development right now. As of now, the following compounds are the only SARMs that have been studied on humans:  Ostarine Side Effects Ostarine also known also known as Enobosarm, GTx-024 and MK-2866 is the most well known and extensively studied selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) right now. It is categorized as a SARM because of its unique selectivity at the androgen receptor where it exhibits a significant amount of anabolic activity in the body relative to androgenic activity. It is being researched to determine if it is a potential treatment for the management of muscle and bone wasting diseases. Enobosarm (Ostarine) Pipeline Increased Hemoglobin And Hematocrit Small, statistically significant increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed with Ostarine 3 mg compared to placebo [R]. Effect On Lipids Reductions in serum lipids (namely HDL and LDL) occurred in a dose dependent manner with Ostarine usage, while another study only showed reductions of HDL levels (otherwise known as “good cholesterol”) [R, R]. We at least know for sure that Ostarine has a negative effect on HDL levels, which is notable as this is a common side effect of all traditional anabolic steroids, and other SARMs. Natural Testosterone Suppression Ostarine has also shown to significantly lower Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) and serum total testosterone levels in clinical trials in subjects treated with 1 mg of Ostarine or higher [R]. While SHBG was always significantly impacted at notable dosages, suppression of LH and FSH wasn't consistently proven throughout Ostarine's clinical trials. However, after referencing anecdotal logs of baseline pre-Ostarine blood work compared to mid-Ostarine blood work with dosages several times higher than the 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg dosages used in trials (users commonly use Ostarine at upwards of 25 mg per day for several months), I believe it's safe to say that Ostarine does also show blatant reductions in all of these hormones markers in a dose dependent manner, the dosages in the studies just weren't high enough to yield this data. The degree to which even high dosages of Ostarine suppress LH and FSH is far less than that of traditional anabolic steroids though, which should be noted. The process of recovering to baseline healthy endocrine function would be hindered to a far greater extent in steroid users. Liver Toxicity Short-lived increases in ALT to above the upper limit of normal were observed in eight subjects in one of Ostarine's clinical trials. The ALT observations in seven of eight subjects had resolved while still continuing their daily dosage, and no subject had clinically significant abnormal levels of ALT or AST at the end of study. One subject was discontinued due to an elevation in ALT 4.2 times the upper limit of normal. The ALT level in that subject returned to normal levels after discontinuation of the Ostarine [R]. This was with dosages of no higher than 3 mg per day, so it is only logical to assume that common recreational dosages of Osatarine (upwards of 25 mg) may exhibit some level of liver enzyme elevation. This is contradictory to common broscience theories that assert that there is zero chance of liver toxicity from SARMs at any dosage amount, or that an increase in ALT in their blood work must mean that they received methylated prohormones instead of SARMs. At therapeutic dosages, there appears to be a low risk profile, but it should be noted that there may be some notable degree of liver toxicity at dosages commonly used for performance enhancement, which would likely resolve itself after cycling off. LGD-4033 Side Effects LGD-4033, also known as Ligandrol, was originally developed by Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and was licensed afterwards to Viking Therapeutics. It is now officially named VK5211 under Viking Therapeutics. LGD-4033 is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) developed to be a potential treatment for a variety of musculoskeletal degenerative diseases. LGD-4033 is purported to be the most potent SARM currently in clinical trials, with its data exhibiting the most favorable ratio of anabolic activity relative to androgenic activity. LGD-4033 (VK5211) Pipeline While LGD-4033 was generally regarded as safe in human trials using dosages as high as 22 mg per day, that doesn't mean it had no negative side effects. These were some of the negative side effects reported in the clinical data. Effect On Lipids The clinical data shows dose-dependent suppression of HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels with LGD-4033 usage [R]. A negative effect on HDL levels is consistently noted as a common side effect of all traditional anabolic steroids, and other SARMs. Despite SARMs ability to be selective about how they exert anabolic activity in the body, they evidently do not differ much from anabolic steroids in regards to their effects on lipid profiles. Natural Testosterone Suppression SARMs have shown to suppress luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, thus decreasing testosterone in a dose-dependent manner [R]. Ligandrol suppressed Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) and total testosterone levels in clinical trials in a dose-dependent manner. Serum free testosterone and FSH levels were only suppressed in the subjects treated with 1 mg of Ligandrol [R]. There was no LH suppression in subjects treated with Ligandrol during the 21 day clinical trial conducted on healthy young men. However, the treated groups were only administered either 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, or 1.0 mg for three weeks, which are relatively low dosages and is also a short time frame. Based on the overwhelming supporting data on anabolic agents collected over the past 50 years, I believe it's safe to say that LGD-4033 will show blatant reductions in all of these hormone markers in a dose dependent manner, and the dosages in the studies just weren't high enough to consistently yield this data. At higher dosages (above 1 mg), I am sure serum free testosterone levels would drop considerably as the dose was titrated up, and other markers would decrease in parallel. Liver Toxicity LGD-4033 did not result in any significant changes in AST or ALT levels in human trials [R]. However, it should be noted that in a relevant clinical trial conducted on Ostarine (a SARM with an identical mechanism of action), short-lived increases in ALT to above the upper limit of normal were observed in eight subjects [R]. Taking this into consideration, it's entirely possible that LGD-4033 could potentially also exhibit some degree of liver toxicity at dosages higher than the 1 mg trialed where they assessed those health markers. At therapeutic dosages, there appears to be a strong safety profile and the data suggests a complete absence of liver toxicity. GSK2881078 Side Effects GSK2881078, a SARM being investigated by GlaxoSmithKline for the treatment of musculoskeletal degenerative diseases, was tested in a 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation Phase 1 study [R]. This trial was conducted on 108 participants broken up into cohorts of young men and postmenopausal women. GSK2881078 was found to be well tolerated. Expectedly, GSK2881078 caused reductions in HDL levels. A few individuals noted constipation, dyspepsia, and nausea. 1 woman developed a maculopapular rash with biopsy consistent with a drug reactions. 2 women experienced elevated ALT values 2-2.5 times the upper limit of normal during treatment. 2 men experienced muscle soreness and elevated creatine kinase levels weeks into the follow-up period. PF-06260414 Side Effects PF-06260414, a novel SARM, was involved in a Phase 1 combination, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose escalation, parallel-group study in 72 healthy adult men of mixed ethnicity [R]. PF-06260414 was found to be well tolerated. Decreases in HDL levels and increases in serum ALT levels were noted and consistent with other findings we have on SARMs. Headaches, decreased appetite, dizziness, and upper respiratory infection were also noted in some of the participants. 1 man discontinued the drug due to fatigue, and another discontinued due to anxiety. Elevated Estrogen Or Decreased Estrogen This side effect applies to all SARMs and is not reported in the clinical data, as the therapeutic dosages used, or durations of exposure, were likely insufficient to produce this outcome. SARMs do not aromatize into Estrogen, however, by suppressing natural Testosterone levels it can create an unfavorable balance between Testosterone and Estrogen in the body. By occupying the androgen receptor with such a high affinity, SARMs can divert a significant amount of Testosterone to aromatize into Estrogen that wouldn't have otherwise. The consequence of this is a systemic elevation of Estrogen levels in the body, which is commonly misinterpreted as prohormone laced SARMs. Common symptoms of high estrogen include:  Acne, oily skin Erectile dysfunction Low libido Lethargy Gynecomastia (man boobs) Irritability Depression Water retention High blood pressure Enlarged prostate Shrunken testicles Sugar cravings  While SARMs can cause Estrogen levels to rise via the increased aromatization of circulating Testosterone, long-term use, or high dosages of SARMs can cause an opposite effect, where the body has such a low level of circulating Testosterone via endocrine suppression that the body no longer has enough aromatization occurring to satisfy Estrogen fulfilled physiological functions. Low Estrogen levels can lead to a variety of health problems. Common symptoms of low estrogen include:  Dull weak orgasms Dry skin and lips Dehydration Erectile dysfunction Low libido Irritability Mood swings Loss of appetite Fatigue Lethargy Decreased bone mass and strength  Interpreting The Data – SARMs Vs Anabolic Steroids There is a common misconception that all of the human trials on SARMs have been conducted using minuscule dosages, and would lead to catastrophic outcomes if used at the same dosages of traditional steroids. While I agree that the data on “high dosages” of SARMs is too limited right now, there were ascending dose studies to evaluate the tolerability of these compounds, they are often just overlooked. Highest Dosage Of Ostarine Well Tolerated In Humans Ostarine has been evaluated in 27 completed or ongoing clinical trials. About 1500 subjects in total have been treated with Ostarine in some capacity, with dosages ranging from as low as 0.1 mg all the way up to 100 mg. Ostarine was observed to be generally safe and well tolerated in all of those trials. One notable Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated Ostarine as a form of hormonal therapy for women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and androgen receptor positive (AR+) breast cancer was broken down into two dose cohorts (9 mg and 18 mg daily). The Phase 2 trial pre-specified threshold for success, clinical benefit response (CBR), was attained meeting the trial’s primary efficacy endpoint. The trial enrolled the predefined number of evaluable patients in both dosage arms with at least 44 patients in each of two cohorts receiving 9 mg or 18 mg daily doses of Ostarine (Enobosarm) respectively [R, R]. This study in particular presented the first opportunity for us to gather clinical data representing what results would occur from what would generally be considered “high dosages” of Ostarine. Highest Dosage Of LGD-4033 Well Tolerated In Humans The first Phase 1 trial involving LGD-4033 was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial conducted in 2009 on 48 healthy male volunteers. The volunteers were divided into six cohorts and received an escalating daily dosage of LGD-4033 ranging from 0.1 mg per day to 22 mg per day. All doses of LGD-4033 tested in humans (even the 22 mg per day dosage) were shown to be safe and well-tolerated, with predictable pharmacokinetics. Are SARMs Safer Than Steroids? In a therapeutic context, when compared with steroidal androgens, SARMs appear to be much better tolerated with fewer incidences of severe adverse events. They are also orally bioavailable, which lowers the risk of accidental exposure, which is a limitation of topical Testosterone. Obviously when it comes to adoption and use, oral therapies are going to be favored over injections as well. The most consistent hindrance of health markers shared between most SARMs are decreases in HDL levels and transient increases in ALT. However, this is in a therapeutic context, not a supraphysiological muscle bulding context for bodybuilding purposes. When it comes to using massive dosages for bodybuilding purposes, are SARMs still safer than steroids? From an androgenicity context, I think the answer is undoubtedly yes. However, when it comes to hepatotoxicity, suppressed lipids and HPTA, is the risk to reward that much different? That remains to be seen. Frankly, I believe certain SARMs are safer at all dosages, but the issue is that their muscle building potential is lower than that of many anabolic steroids. Significantly lower when it comes to certain SARMs (some are formidable to many traditionally used steroids). Some are much more effective than others, but the question arises, if you are going to smash your lipids and shut down your natural Testosterone levels anyways with megadoses of SARMs, would it not be worth it to just take the plunge into a steroid cycle instead if muscle growth is the goal? This is where the real debate is. The debate is not whether or not SARMs work. We already know they work and will continue to improve as more powerful SARMs are developed, the debate lies in the anabolic ceiling of the current SARMs in development, and their risk to reward profile in a supraphysiological context. The SARMs Side Effect Bottom Line I think SARMs are the future of performance enhancement as well as musculoskeletal degenerative disease treatment. They will continue to improve and become more and more efficacious as time goes on, and slowly phase out traditional less tissue selective anabolic steroids. However, this does not mean that SARMs are side effect free, and they certainly are not all equal to one another simply because they are categorized as a SARM. Take S23 for example. S23 is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) currently under development for potential use as a male hormonal contraceptive. While it has a superior level of anabolic to androgenic tissue selectivity when compared to Testosterone, this does not mean it is an ideal SARM at all. Something overlooked is that S23 is also being evaluated as a potential treatment for androgen deficiency in postmenopausal women. Basically, something better than Testosterone to increase the libido of androgen deficient women in menopause. That in itself should tell you everything you need to know about its inherent androgenicity. It's literally being developed as a contraceptive for men which would replace the androgen dependent functions typically mediated by Testosterone and DHT in the body, as well as a means to increase the androgen index in postmenopausal women. Just because its more tissue selective than Testosterone, this doesn't mean its as tissue selective as another more efficacious SARM like LGD-4033. At the end of the day, SARMs are not side effect free, but they aren't as bad as they are made out to be by the critics. There isn't enough data to make any conclusive statements on their long-term safety or overall efficacy, but from what we do know, we can see that their development is definitely on the right track and is paving the way for superior anabolic agents.

    "content": "The Highest Steroid Dosages Used By 7 Top IFBB Pros In The 90s     Something every aspiring bodybuilder wants to know is what drugs and dosages the top IFBB pros at the Olympia are using. This article is going to quickly break down the biggest steroid cycles used by 7 top tier IFBB pros in the 90s. 6 of the cycles were outlined in anonymous interviews with 6 of the men when they were asked by Tom Platz to detail their performance enhancing drug use. For a comprehensive deep dive into those interviews with a full transcript and my commentary, you can check them out with the links below.  Ronnie Coleman Lee Priest Paul Dillet Aaron Baker Dennis Newman Chris Cormier  Dorian Yates is the 7th bodybuilder who candidly detailed his past steroid use in several transparent interviews.  The interview in particular that I used as my reference point where he outlined his biggest steroid cycle ever was the Joe Rogan podcast episode Dorian was on. Dorian also outlined what his typical drug use was like in an interview with Muscular Development a couple years ago. Let's start with Dorian Yates' biggest steroid cycle.   Table of Contents ToggleDorian YatesLee PriestPaul DilletOffseason CycleContest Prep CyclePaul Dillet's Macros Pre-contestAaron BakerDennis NewmanChris CormierFinal WordRelated Dorian Yates Dorian Yates stated he used more drugs in his offseason as opposed to pre-contest. He concluded that it made the most sense to use the most drugs when he's trying in a calorie surplus trying to gain muscle. After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Dorian Yates' steroid cycle dosages pre-contest, he claims his use broke down to the following:  Testosterone – 1000 mg per week Deca (Nandrolone Decanoate) – 500 mg per week Dianabol (Dbol) – 40 to 50 mg per day GH – 2 to 4 IU per day  As far as insulin, Dorian claimed insulin was part of his protocol later in his career. However, he saw the effects it had on his body composition as a net negative, as he sacrificed dry grainy detail in the muscle for a smoother more bloated look that came with the size gained with insulin. Ronnie Coleman  After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Ronnie Coleman's steroid cycle dosages pre-contest, he claims his use broke down to the following:  Testex (concentration of 250 mg/mL) – 750 mg per week split into one 250 mg injection three times per week Primobolan (concentration of 100 mg/mL) – 300 mg per week split into one 100 mg injection three times per week Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca) – 200 mg per week (unclear if he used more than 200 mg per week or not) Testosterone Heptylate (concentration of 250 mg/mL) – 500 mg per week split into one 250 mg injection twice per week Primobolan, Dbol or Anadrol tablets – Roughly 25-100 mg per day depending on the oral steroid chosen Human Growth Hormone (HGH) – 4 IU per day Humulin R Insulin – 30 IU split into two 15 IU injections only for the carb up phase before a competition  Lee Priest  This is the one that everyone thinks is bullshit because of how conservative his usage was. Notably, Lee Priest was one of the only top IFBB pros in the 90s (if not the only) to do a completely transparent interview during the prime of his career where the video could severely impact his placements. After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Lee Priest's steroid cycle dosages pre-contest, he claims his use broke down to the following:  Injectable Stanozolol (Winstrol) – 200 mg per week split into two 100 mg injections every three days Primobolan – 200 mg per week Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca) – 200 mg per week Anadrol tablets – 50 mg per day Human Growth Hormone (HGH) – 2 IU per day  Paul Dillet  Paul's was a lot more detailed. He had offseason dosages, contest prep dosages, and he even laid out his diet macros which was really interesting. After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Paul Dillet's steroid cycle dosages pre-contest, he claims his use broke down to the following: Offseason Cycle  Testosterone Cypionate – 400-600 mg per week Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca) – 400-600 mg per week Anadrol – 50-100 mg per day  Contest Prep Cycle  Testosterone Propionate – 500-600 mg per week Primobolan – 500-600 mg per week Anadrol – 50-100 mg per day GH (growth hormone) – 9 IUs per day Proviron – 4-5 pills per day Cytomel – Titrating up to 100 mcg per day  Paul Dillet's Macros Pre-contest  Calories – 4000 calories per day Protein – 450-600 grams per day Carbs – 100-200 grams per day Fats – 75-100 grams per day  Aaron Baker  After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Aaron Baker's steroid cycle dosages pre-contest, he claims his use broke down to the following:  Testosterone Cypionate – 400 mg per week Primobolan – 100-200 mg per week Anadrol – 50 mg per day Parabolan – Dosage was not specified Winstrol, Dianabol, Anavar, Halotestin – Reserved for specific phases pre-contest or during mass gaining phases. Dosages were not specified. Growth Hormone – 2 IUs/day, every other day, for 10-12 weeks, pre-contest only Insulin – 10 IUs administered twice a day, pre-contest only  Dennis Newman  After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Dennis Newman's steroid cycle dosages pre-contest, he claims his use broke down to the following:  Testosterone Cypionate – 200 mg twice a week = 400 mg/week Sustanon – 250 mg twice a week = 500 mg/week Testosterone Enanthate – 200 mg twice a week = 400 mg/week Anavar – 25-30 mg a day Parabolan – Two 76 mg Parabolan amps per week = 152 mg/week Primobolan – 1 shot every 3 days = 200 mg/week Winstrol – 50 mg a day = 350 mg/week Halotestin – Used pre-contest, the dosage was not disclosed. My educated guess is that he probably used between 20-40 mg per day for the last 2-3 weeks of his contest prep. Growth Hormone – Tried it twice with a dosage as high as 4 IU per day Insulin – Tried a couple IU as an experiment but didn't want to increase the dosage  Keep in mind, Dennis Newman had a very short-lived career, and this may not be indicative of what he would have gone on to use had his career not been cut short. Chris Cormier  After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Chris Cormier's steroid cycle dosages pre-contest, he claims his use broke down to the following:  Equipoise – 300 mg/week Primobolan – 400 mg/week Growth Hormone – 4-9IUs/day Testosterone – 800 mg/week Winstrol – 300 to 450 mg/week Halotestin – 30 to 40mg/day Insulin – Three or four doses of 12 to 15 IUs/day Teslac – 50 to 200 mg/day  Final Word If you want to hear my thoughts and commentary on each of the cycles above, check out the respective video for the bodybuilder you are interested in. At the end of the day, take these cycles with a grain of salt and form your own conclusions. Yes, they could be lying, which is what most automatically assume when they see a top pro outline what is generally considered “moderate” dosages. But they also might not be. Personally, I think the interviews were truthful, perhaps with a couple exceptions with guys who didn't want to implicate themselves with certain scenarios that would have resulted in being able to easily identify them (e.g. Paul Dillet with the diuretics discussion). There you have it: 7 top IFBB Pros in the 90s and their respective cycles.

    "content": "DHB (Dihydroboldenone) | The Most Overhyped and Liver Toxic Injectable Steroid?     DHB, also known as Dihydroboldenone or 1-Testosterone, has gotten a lot of hype in the past few years in the bodybuilding community. Guys are always looking for the new exotic steroid to try. It's almost like a form of shiny object syndrome. Juice heads are looking for the next best thing, and as soon as a hormone they haven't tried starts getting some traction in the community, they jump on the bandwagon assuming that this new hormone must hold the key to unlocking their true bodybuilding potential. The fact of the matter is that 1-Testosterone has been around for quite some time, however, it just was never seen as efficacious enough to pursue in a therapeutic context.   Table of Contents ToggleWhat Is DHB?Boldenone (Equipoise) Vs DHB (Dihydroboldenone)Studies Conducted On 1-Testosterone (DHB)Anabolic Activity Of DHB Vs TestosteronePotential Liver ToxicityLack Of AromatizationNo Established Efficacy Or Safety ProfileBetter AlternativesRelated What Is DHB? DHB is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is more commonly known as the 5-alpha reduced metabolite of Boldenone (Equipoise). Just like how Testosterone interacts with 5-alpha reductase to produce dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Boldenone 5-alpha reduces into DHB (Dihydroboldenone). Among many using this hormone in a performance enhancing context, it is reported to be formidable to Trenbolone in regards to muscle building potential, but with a more favorable side-effect profile. Advocates of Dihydroboldenone claim that it is twice as strong as Testosterone. This claim is typically based on the premise that DHB features an anabolic to androgenic ratio of 200/100. Thus, it is implied to be twice as tissue selective as Testosterone, milligram for milligram. Unlike its parent hormone, DHB features no estrogenic effects, which is seen as a desirable trait among those seeking efficacious steroids to use in conjunction with Testosterone. Boldenone (Equipoise) Vs DHB (Dihydroboldenone) Boldenone (Equipoise) is a derivative of Testosterone that was created by adding a double-bond between carbon atoms one and two. Chemical Structure Of Boldenone This bond dramatically slows aromatization and makes the steroid a poor substrate for 5-alpha reductase. While Boldenone is a substrate for 5-alpha reductase and can be converted into DHB, the amount converted by even a high dose of Boldenone is not substantial. Although Boldenone inherently has strong anabolic effects and moderate androgenic effects, DHB is perceived by many in the bodybuilding community as the superior hormone in a muscle building context. Mega-dosing EQ in order to try and achieve moderate serum concentrations of DHB is a strategy that has been deployed by many bodybuilders in the past. Due to the parent hormone Equipoise being such a poor substrate for 5-alpha reductase, an increasing number of bodybuilders have started to simply opt to use straight DHB instead. Chemical Structure Of DHB (Dihydroboldenone) Studies Conducted On 1-Testosterone (DHB) Very little clinical data exists evaluating the efficacy or safety profile of DHB. There is only one study that we can reference that actually shows how DHB stacks up to Testosterone in a controlled clinical setting. 17β-Hydroxy-5alpha-androst-1-en-3-one (1-testosterone) is a potent androgen with anabolic properties  This study was conducted on 1-Testosterone (DHB) after it was scheduled in the US. The goal of the study was to establish that DHB is not a “prohormone” as was incorrectly stated by many supplement companies prior to its scheduling. By evaluating the effect DHB has on androgen sensitive tissues in the body via the androgen receptor, the study established that DHB is in fact an anabolic androgenic steroid. While the premise of the study was meant to simply explore the AR dependent transactivation mediated with DHB, the measured effect DHB had on various tissues in the body relative to Testosterone shed light on how tissue selective and efficacious this hormone really is. Anabolic Activity Of DHB Vs Testosterone After being orchiectomised (surgical removal of testicles), castrated rats were left for 7 days to allow sufficient hormonal decline. This process allows the scientists to administer exogenous androgens and then weigh different organs in the body and measure how much of an impact a specific drug has on muscle tissue, androgen sensitive tissues like the prostate, as well as vital organs. The rats were then subcutaneously administered everyday with either an inert vehicle, 1 mg/kg/bw/day of Testosterone Propionate (TP), or 1 mg/kg/bw/day of DHB (1-Testo). Milligram for milligram, DHB was shown to induce less muscle growth than Testosterone, while stimulating the prostate and seminal vesicle just as much.  This means that in order to replicate the same level of muscle growth, DHB would need to be dosed higher than Testosterone. Where this supposed 200/100 anabolic/androgenic ratio came from I'm not sure, but the only clinical data I could find evaluating the tissue selectivity of DHB certainly does not reflect that. It is less tissue selective than Testosterone, and less anabolic overall. Potential Liver Toxicity Typically, hepatotoxicity occurs with the use of orally active 17α-alkylated anabolic androgen steroids. Flagship signs of liver toxicity include elevated liver enzymes, and in some cases even liver enlargement. Expectedly, the Testosterone Propionate treated group did not show any signs of liver toxicity. However, the DHB treated group experienced a significant increase in liver weight.  While this is not definitive proof that DHB is liver toxic, I do not feel the risk to reward is there with this compound when there are several other steroids with clinical testing on humans backing their superior efficacy and safety profiles. No human trials to reference, red flag #1. Less anabolic and tissue selective than Testosterone, red flag #2. Potentially liver toxic even in an injectable format, red flag #3. Lack Of Aromatization While the bodybuilding community typically sees hormones that do not aromatize into Estrogen as ideal candidates to throw into their cycles because they are “dry” and don't “bloat”, I am more interested in potential hormone replacement therapy alternatives that could offer improved efficacy and safety profiles relative to Testosterone. The entire point of synthesizing new steroids to begin with is to find anabolic hormones that are more tissue selective and anabolic than Testosterone. While DHB is not a substrate for aromatase, this is not particularly advantageous for its therapeutic promise in a clinical setting, as it would then require exogenous Estradiol administration alongside it to even be viable in an HRT context, or a Testosterone base, but then that sort of defeats the idea of potential DHB monotherapy in the first place. No Established Efficacy Or Safety Profile At the end of the day, there is no data on the effect DHB has on the human body other than anecdotal logs on forums, and the data we can extrapolate from the preclinical rodent model is not promising. While I'm not against experimentation, if I were to incorporate what is more or less just an experimental androgen, I would at least choose something that appears to have therapeutic promise based on its preclinical profile. When it comes to what to use with Testosterone in a bodybuilding context to build muscle, there are far more promising alternatives than DHB. Personally, if I was still trying to build up my physique (and I didn't care about my hair), I would opt for other DHT derivatives before I would even consider DHB. Better Alternatives Primobolan for example is a very underrated steroid, and is the first injectable DHT derivative I would be looking at for gaining size. Nandrolone is another hormone I would look at. When it comes to growth promoting agents, these drugs all more or less do the same thing, some are just more tolerable than others because they have superior levels of tissue selectivity and a general lack of negative side effects relative to the other less efficacious alternatives. Why would I use DHB when I can use something like Nandrolone or Primobolan that has copious amounts of human data backing their efficacy and tolerability at dosages greatly exceeding what would be considered physiological replacement androgen levels? I wouldn't.

    "date": "2019-08-30T00:00:01+00:00",
    "content": "The REAL Half-Life Of S4 (Andarine) | It Is NOT Four Hours     A common misconception about the Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) S4 , also known as Andarine, is its half-life. The Human Equivalent Half-Life Of S4 In Preclinical Studies The preclinical data states that the half-life of S4 is only 4 hours in humans [R].  When I experimented with S4 myself, my dosing protocol was designed based upon this statistic, and you will often see others suggest that twice per day dosing is mandatory to maintain even relatively stable blood serum concentrations of this SARM due to its “short half-life”. I have found this 4 hour statistic to be completely incorrect in practical application. Data showing the pharmacokinetics of S4 in humans has never been published, so this statistic suggests that it was either pulled out of a scientists ass, or there was some sort of unpublished trial on humans at some point. The fact that S4 is now an abandoned SARM suggests that it may in fact have been tested on humans at some point. Perhaps the night vision side effect is what led to its abandonment in the first place, but that is unknown at this time and is all just speculation on my part. The discovery of the night vision side effect was stumbled across by accident (no pun intended) via anecdotal findings years ago, and to date the supposed half-life of four hours is still circulated around the community, despite it taking several days to restore uninhibited sight at certain dosages.  The Real Half-Life Of S4 In Humans Anybody who has dosed S4 high enough to a point where they broke the barrier and entered hulk vision, sepia-filter mode, can attest to the fact that it takes longer than 24 hours to restore vision after discontinuation of the SARM. Personally, I noticed that there seems to be an accumulative effect with S4. When I tried S4, I titrated up to 50 mg per day slowly, always splitting my dosage into a morning and nightly administration. By the time I reached 30 mg, I was already noticing the vision side effect. I pushed my way up to 50 mg and the vision side effect just became substantially more prominent. I left the dose at 50 mg to evaluate whether my body would acclimate and the side effect would start to go away on its own, but the opposite happened, it continued to get worse despite stopping my upward titration. I was sitting on the porch of a cabin underneath what was supposedly an amazing sky full of stars. I couldn't see anything. I couldn't even see the drink I had in my chair's cupholder 2 feet from my face. Accumulative Serum Concentrations Of S4 I pulled the dosage all the way down to 10 mg a day afterwards. Things did not improve, even after several days. I soon realized that the half-life of S4 was much longer than 4 hours. I stopped using it entirely and then kept a close eye on how long it took to resolve itself. For the first few days, there was no improvement. After about a week, I finally started to see things go back to normal. After that experience, I came to the conclusion that the half-life of S4 is probably closer to that of a SARM like LGD-4033, if not longer. My educated guess is that the human equivalent half-life is closer to 36 or 48 hours, rather than 4.

    "content": "How To Test For Hypothyroidism With A Thermometer | Temperature As A Reference Of Thyroid Health     Are you constantly tired, even when you’re well rested and haven't engaged in excessive amounts of strenuous activities? Do you have major brain fog, or perhaps even constantly feel cold, even in the summer? You know you are trying to stay healthy, but still feel constantly run down. You could be a victim of an un-diagnosed case of hypothyroidism. What is Hypothyroidism and what are its symptoms? Hypothyroidism occurs when the body produces a suboptimal amount of thyroid hormones. These hormones are generally responsible for the organization of three of the body’s critical functions: metabolism, growth, and energy. People with hypothyroidism are essentially hampered in these three major facets of their health, which exhibit a variety of symptoms. Some of the most common manifestations of the disorder includes:  Tiredness Weight gain, even when dieting very hard Cold sensation General body weakness, especially in the muscles and bones Hair loss (alopecia) Skin disorders Emotional depression Brain fog Constipation   What causes Hypothyroidism? Poor lifestyle choices, poor sleep, genetics, toxins, poor diet choices, autoimmune triggers, underlying medical conditions, and trauma are some of the most common causes of why people experience hypothyroidism. But, in most cases, it is caused by an autoimmune disorder which causes inflammation of the thyroid gland, called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. As an autoimmune disorder, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis causes the body’s antibodies to attack and subsequently damage the thyroid gland. This is a kind of anomaly that happens in the human body, shared by all autoimmune conditions in general. How is the disorder diagnosed? The most accurate and effective way of knowing whether you have the condition or not is a series of blood test. The blood makes for the best indicator of the thyroid disorder due to the serum concentrations of two hormones. Namely, the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4). These are the hormone which drives the thyroid to secrete its hormone and the actual hormone secreted, respectively. Generally-speaking, a sub-optimal value in thyroxine indicates strongly that a person is suffering from hypothyroidism. The presence of thyroid-stimulating hormone, on the other hand, suggests the inefficiency of the hormone itself in stimulating the release of thyroxine. The two are actually related. However, an elevated level of TSH and normal reading on T4 might also insinuate the likelihood of mild hypothyroidism. In addition, TSH and T4 could look perfectly fine, but if you have suboptimal T4 to T3 conversion, you will also experience hypothyroidism. The inactive form of thyroid hormone T4 converts to the active form T3 (triiodothyronine) which is what facilitates the majority of Thyroid mediated functions in the body. On top of that, even if you have in range TSH, T4 and T3 serum concentrations in your blood work, you could still be triggering Hashimotos Thyroiditis via diet choices or environmental toxins that exacerbate leaky gut. It is not uncommon for individuals to experience blatant hypothyroidism symptoms while still having perfect looking blood work, simply due to the ignorance of their physician failing to also look at their inflammation levels in the body, diet and environment, as well as three very important blood markers of Thyroid health that are commonly overlooked entirely. These three markers are Thyroid peroxidase (TPO), Thyroglobulin (Tg) Antibodies and Reverse T3. How else can you “potentially” diagnose hypothyroidism without blood tests? While blood work is the gold standard for assessing your current thyroid status, it goes without saying that it is time consuming and expensive to get blood tests every few weeks, and a cheap, quick and easy way to evaluate if your thyroid health is trending in a positive direction between blood tests would be invaluable. Fortunately, I learned about a way this can be done when I was in the process of restoring my own thyroid health. You can test for hypothyroidism with a thermometer at home to accomplish this. As a caveat, this method is by no means a concrete method of diagnosing whether or not you have hypothyroidism. But if you are looking for an easy yet cheap—or free—way of knowing you might have the disorder; you may do so by checking your body’s temperature with a thermometer. Yes, that same thing that you either put under your armpit or in your mouth to see how warm your body is. You probably already have one lying in one corner of your house. But if you do not, a little visit from the nearest drug store or buying one off Amazon will suffice. A high quality thermometer is not cost-prohibitive, and it will prove to be an invaluable tool throughout your life when assessing how micro-changes in your lifestyle or diet impact your thyroid status. I don't know about you, but I don't want to have to get a blood test every single time I change every little thing in my life to see if it negatively or positively impacts my thyroid health. If you would look back at one of the symptoms of the health condition, you’d see the “cold sensation” in the list, right? A healthy functioning thyroid is necessary to maintain normal body temperature, and if you have hypothyroidism you will very likely experience lower than normal body temperature. You literally feel cold with hypothyroidism because your body temperature is lower than it should be. How To Test For Hypothyroidism With A Thermometer Now, there is a common misconception about the use of a thermometer when it comes to getting an accurate reading. Leaving a thermometer under your armpit or in your mouth for 30-60 seconds will not cut it. It has to be longer than that. 5 minutes minimum if you check your temperature orally under your tongue. 10 minutes minimum if you check your temperature using your armpit. The difference between letting the thermometer sit in for a mere 10 seconds and for a longer 10 minutes is massive. One is significantly lower than the other, and thereby, not the most accurate of two outcomes. If I take my temperature when I wake up and only leave it in for 10 seconds, the thermometer will show that I am as low as 96 degrees Fahrenheit. If I wait the full 10 minutes though, the thermometer is able to pickup an accurate reading after acclimating to the temperature in my mouth or armpit, and it will show that I am 98.0 to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. 10 seconds is simply too short a time for any good working thermometer to get the precise values. You would not want to make a mistake of “misdiagnosing” yourself as having hypothyroidism just because of a faulty thermometer reading.  But, like I said, merely tracking your body’s temperature per se is not the most definitive way to know whether or not you have the disease. But, it certainly does help in giving you a rough idea of how bad your hypothyroidism is, and if it is trending in a positive or negative direction. Typically, with some lifestyle and dietary adjustments, hypothyroidism can be fixed—especially if it’s just a dietary problem—and using your body’s improving temperature is one good tell-tale sign for that assessing your progress as you remove potential autoimmune triggers from your diet and start choosing more micronutrient dense foods that hit your iodine and selenium requirements, or any of the other myriad of nutrients you could potentially be deficient in. To reiterate, this method I mentioned is by no means a substitute to an actual clinical test required to properly diagnose hypothyroidism. The Ideal Body Temperature The average temperature of a healthy adult with a healthy thyroid is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37.0 degrees Celsius mid-afternoon. Upon waking, the average healthy temperature is between 97.8 to 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Your body temperature should trend up from the low 98's up to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the morning into the afternoon. If it is less than that, you could have hypothyroidism, or you could be under-treated if you are already being treated for hypothyroidism. Alternatively, it may be indicative adrenal dysfunction. If your body temperature varies on a daily basis (comparing measurements at the same time of day) by over 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit, you may have adrenal dysfunction. If you are checking your temperature in your armpit, it is typically advised to add 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit to your result to get an accurate result. Armpit temperatures are typically about 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit lower than oral under the tongue temperature readings. Which Thermometer To Buy Patients with hypothyroidism consistently report that Mercury thermometers are more accurate than digital thermometers. If you want to compare digital thermometers to the gold standard Mercury thermometers until you find a digital one that is formidable in accuracy, by all means do that, but always keep a Mercury thermometer on hand as a reference point for a more consistently accurate reading. Most digital thermometers tend to be off by up to a full degree.

There is some speculation as to whether this was Mike Matarazzo or Dennis Newman in the interview. Some even thought it was Bob Ciccarello. The consensus is that this is more than likely Dennis Newman, but we don't know for certain as this interview was meant to be anonymous after all. In the video below, the anonymous bodybuilder who competed in the 90's is interviewed by Tom Platz as part of a short video series called “Backstage Secrets of Pros.” In this interview, we get some valuable insight into what his performance enhancing practices were in the 90's.

And really, I know you're not used to doing that, probably, but the nature of this video is just that addressing the issues and in terms of honesty.  But (INAUDIBLE) important to do that mainly because we can make a difference to the viewer.  I mean, for the first time, I think they can hear the issues presented in terms of reality, rather than avoiding the issue pretending it doesn't exist, or lying to the, you know, the up-and-coming athletes who are vying for position in various sport form. Okay?  So, I guess my first question to you would be, what made you decide — what situation in your life made you decide that you were going to use steroids?” Dennis Newman: “Well, when I was 16 years old, I did my first bodybuilding show.  I've been training since I was like, 14.  I was doing like, upper body and kind of skipping out on legs and stuff like that.  And so, I realized that, you know, in – well, this gym was putting on a contest and Fort (INAUDIBLE) it was like some military contest or whatever.  My dad was in the military so we're in it as a teenager, 16.  And it was just me and another kid and so I won.  So, that was kind of like, the top, you know, I won and the people were telling me, “Hey, you know, you look good. You keep doing them. As you get older, you'll get better.”  So, I started training hard.  I didn't know nothing about steroids.  I heard about it and stuff, but you know, I didn't really …  you know, from a small town where I was from, it was just — I'm hearing too often about what was going on and not anything about any knowledge about any other drug.  But when I competed again the year later, that's 17 (INAUDIBLE) a Mr. California teenage show, and it was (INAUDIBLE) contest.  And the kid that won it, he was 19 and I was 17.  And this kid looked so incredible.  I mean, he could have — I think he did win the men's open class, too.” Tom Platz: “Wow.” Dennis Newman: “And he just looked – I was just like was shocked that a 19-year-old could look like that.  That's when I knew in my head, I would rather — you know, I wanted to take the risk.  You know, it wasn't going to be – I didn't think it was that big of a risk.  So, I just figured I need to do something to get that big by the time I'm 19.”  How Old Was Dennis Newman When He Started His First Steroid Cycle Tom Platz: “Okay, so you were 19 when you initiated this program?” Dennis Newman: “Right. Yeah.” Tom Platz: “Okay.” [03:13] That's a lot not a lot younger than most and I think it's actually pretty standard. A lot of these guys nowadays are starting at 17, 18 years old. I'm not saying it's responsible to start at 19 at all. To be honest, that's super early, still. But it's interesting to see the progression of these guys and how it compares to kids' mentality nowadays. Dennis Newman: “That time the people that I – you know, I didn't know (INAUDIBLE) ask for and stuff.  You go into a gym and somebody says, “Hey, you want this?”  And I've had that approached to me when I was younger and I said no.  But when it happened again, the guy — he gave me some — I think it was some Testosterone Cypionate and I think some Deca.  And he told me — he gave me one Sustanon shot (INAUDIBLE) this is a booster.  You take this and two weeks later, it's going to just totally change you.  So, here I am, taking this stuff and I find out later it's all sesame oil because the guy was running fake stuff.  And then, that's — so I figured my first cycle was fake.  And I think that just wanting to — wanting it to work, I trained harder (INAUDIBLE) and it worked.  I mean, I did get bigger, but I think maybe one of the drugs is good.” Tom Platz: “Which is?” Testosterone Cypionate Use Dennis Newman: “Which probably was the Test.” Tom Platz: Okay. Test. What …” Dennis Newman: “(INAUDIBLE) I think it was Cypionate.” Tom Platz: “Okay.” Dennis Newman: “Because I did get a little puffy, and I gained like 20 pounds.  You know, and it wasn't really hard muscles.  It's just, you know, bloated puffiness and stuff like that, because I didn't know how to eat right.  I didn't know how to, you know, diet, and how much protein I should have taken — took in and other stuff.  I didn't do that much reading up on it, I kind of just went by what everybody was, you know, saying.” [5:03] That sounds pretty much like the stereotypical thing that most people did. My story wasn't a whole lot different than that. I did a bit more research than this guy it sounds like, but it's funny, history seems to repeats itself in the younger generation. Tom Platz: “Okay, I guess at this point, you mentioned the Cypionate being something you responded well, very favorably to — Testosterone Cypionate.  What other drugs would – do you have in your, I guess, your mind at this point (INAUDIBLE) relay to us that you found …” Winstrol Use Dennis Newman: “Winstrol was one of the favorites, I loved it.  I mean, I found out, you know, after a few contests that I took — I had a friend of mine tell me that that's all he took, and he looked incredible.  And actually, he was a professional.  And you know, these guys aren't going to tell you what they take and stuff (INAUDIBLE) they kind of hide it and stuff.  So, I've imagined for a couple of years that Winstrol was all he took.  You know, he once told me that, you know, you take that and that's it.  So, I was just taking that maybe, you know, cycling it with some Deca and, you know, couple — maybe I tried Anadrol like 19 tabs of it.  And I started getting headaches and stuff, so I dropped that.  I was really scared of the steroids and stuff.” Dennis Newman's Steroid Cycle Dosages Tom Platz: “I guess when you started putting together your first constructive cycle, what — the drugs were Cypionate or no?  Dennis Newman: “Yeah.” Tom Platz: “Cypionate. How much — how much Cypionate in terms of dosage per day?” Dennis Newman: “I did 200 mg twice a week.” Tom Platz: “Okay.” Dennis Newman: “And then I did Winstrol 1 cc every other day.” Tom Platz: “Okay.” Dennis Newman: “And then, I did that for a couple shows until I was 21, 22.  And then, that's when I moved to Southern California.  And that's when I really got the knowledge of what to take and what these guys were doing to look like, you know, what they did.  I think my offseason cycle was like 200 mg or 250 mg twice a week of Sustanon.  200 mg twice a week of — I think it was Enanthate.  And then, it would be like five or six Anavar twice a day every day.  I do that up until like 6 to 8 weeks out from a show.  And then I …” [7:35] I don't even know if I understood correctly. He said two shots of Sustanon but then he would also take Enanthate, as in Test Enanthate. He's taking around a gram of Test, and then five Anavar twice a day, did he say? Pharma grade Anavar back then came in 2.5 mg pills apparently, so that would be 25 to 30 mg of Anavar per day. Dennis Newman: “To switch it Winstrol.  And then Winstrol, Primobolan, and Parabolan.  I take two shots of Parabolan, which are 76 mg.  I take that a week with one every three days of Primobolan. And I take Winstrol 1 cc a day.” Tom Platz:  “A day. Okay.” Dennis Newman: “Yeah.” [8:21]  He's using 152 mg of Trenbolone. The Parabolan ester, it's not Enanthate or Acetate. It's Hexahydrobenzylcarbonate. These were the Negma pharmaceutical-grade Parabolan Amps. As far as the Winstrol, I'm assuming he must have been using 50 mg a day if he administered 1 cc per day. Primobolan, I don't know, it sounds like 200 mg per week, depending on the concentration. Dennis Newman: “And then as I got on with the shows, then, I kind of learned about diuretics, stuff like that.”  When To Stop Using Steroids Prior To A Competition Tom Platz: “Okay. We'll go into that – in a moment, we'll go into that, but did you stop your drug intake prior to the show ever, or is that a consideration?” Dennis Newman: “Oh, yeah, I did.  I stopped everything. I turned …” [9:16] It's kind of interesting because some of the stuff doesn't necessarily have rhyme and reason to it. The traditional theory that you need a Testosterone base isn't necessarily because your body needs Testosterone to support androgen dependent tissues. It's more so to aromatize into a sufficient amount of estradiol, which is what supports the libido in the presence of adjunct androgens. It seems like almost every cycle this guy either uses dosages that would result in excessive aromatization, or combinations that would result in no Estrogen aromatization at all. Dennis Newman: “I take everything out like the last week.  The last week, I get off of everything.” Tom Platz: “Okay. Did you cycle the – (INAUDIBLE) did you go up and down, or just …” Dennis Newman: “I maybe — I might have done that once or twice, but normally, I would just stick to a certain dosage and that's all.  I'd run it all the way through for like 12 weeks.” Tom Platz: “Up until the last week before the show?” Dennis Newman: “Right.” Dennis Newman's Contest Prep Cycle Vs Offseason Tom Platz: “Okay, I see.  Okay, so offseason, let's say, you — how long did you prepare for a show usually?” Dennis Newman: “Usually, 16 weeks.” Tom Platz: “Okay, so if you're preparing 16 weeks or four months, that's the (INAUDIBLE) as you recall it, yes?” Dennis Newman: “Right. Right before a show.” Tom Platz: “Okay. And then in the offseason?” Dennis Newman: “Actually, I take more stuff before a show than I would in the offseason.  Offseason, I'd just stick to basic drugs like, you know, Test and maybe –  oh, you know what, I was taking Halotestin right before the show, too.  But I usually stick with Test and Winstrol.  And I like the Winstrol.  It's just did something …” Winstrol Use [11:00] That's a really weird offseason combination, Testosterone and Winstrol, but I guess it worked for this guy, so there's no argument there. I have no experience with injectable Winstrol, but apparently it's a night and day difference compared to oral. I can't imagine pinning water-based Winstrol on such a consistent basis. The easiest way to get an infection in my opinion is with stuff like that, water-based Winstrol and fast-acting suspensions. It seems like those are the culprits 90% of the time that give guys issues and send them to the ER with an infection. Dennis Newman: “It was veterinarian kind.”  Tom Platz: “Right, Winstrol V?” Dennis Newman: “Yes, Winstrol V.” Tom Platz: “So, there may be some years then where you would be on some form of steroid all-year long?” Dennis Newman: “I think it would be mostly Winstrol all-year-round, but the other ones I would — Any form of test or any androgen, I would get on for eight weeks, and then I get off for like at least eight weeks.  But I'd still Winstrol all-year-round.” Tom Platz: “I see. I see.” [12:17] This guy would stay on Winstrol year-round, meaning, he would be walking around with zero estrogen in his body and just functioning off of a DHT derivative all year, which seems kind of nuts to me. Especially on Winstrol, where it does not only antagonizes estrogen via its mechanism as a DHT derivative, but you have no aromatization occurring because your HPTA is completely shut down. You have zero E2 and would probably have creaky ass dry joints with no libido and have ED issues. At least that's what I would assume would happen. It's kind of interesting that he would be willing to just walk around like that all the time. Winstrol Dosage Tom Platz: “Okay. Dosages went up to — what you (INAUDIBLE) just went over some dosages, do you have a number as far as …”  Dennis Newman: “A cc of Winstrol, 16 weeks out from a contest, every day, and then, in the offseason, just a 1 cc every other day.” Tom Platz: “Was there a weekly or daily milligram dosage that you — a formula you had or not really?” Dennis Newman: “No, not really.  I just went by how many I had and how (INAUDIBLE) long I'll make them last.” Tom Platz: “Okay.” Dennis Newman: “I think basic.” Tom Platz: “I understand.” Dennis Newman: “I've heard a lot of guys out there that really knew exactly what they were doing every day.  I did that once and it was just too confusing. It feels like you're a pin cushion.” Growth Hormone Use Tom Platz: “Yeah, I imagine.  Okay, well, besides the steroids, of course, you know, a lot of discussion in the magazines and in the industry is about growth hormone.  Is that something you ever utilized, and if so, do you find that effective?” Dennis Newman: “I've used it — I used it twice.  First time, I had a friend give it to me with no money.  He just said, “Here, I want you to do good.” He gave me $3,000 worth of stuff.” Tom Platz: “So, how many cc's did you take a day of that?” Dennis Newman: “Actually, I took 4 IU's a day, 4 IU's a day. Tom Platz: “Prior to the show?” Dennis Newman: “And I was – prior to the show.  And I did a show before without it and then I did a show with it.  And I gained like 9 lbs. It was harder and more cut, and bigger than I was three months before when I didn't have it. I felt really good, but that was the only time.  That was the only time I ever felt like that.  And the other times, I did it and it just didn't do the same.  I think it was fake or something. Although, I think the first time I did it was (INAUDIBLE) a 92 amino acid.  And I guess the 91 is the most popular they use nowadays.  So, supposedly, that wasn't supposed to be a one that works good but it worked great for me.” [15:52] You should know the difference between 91 and 92 if you're going to use GH, by the way. Interesting, as 4IU's is nothing insane for pro bodybuilder standards. Tom Platz: “That's very interesting.  It seems like everything we've been talking to a few different athletes all day and everyone has a similar feeling about certain things, but some diversified situations.  I imagine being (INAUDIBLE) chemistry, a different body, everyone responds differently to a degree to a — given different system — given two different systems of intake.” Dennis Newman's Take On Insulin Tom Platz: “Okay. Well, does insulin for you go along with GH, was that a consideration?” Dennis Newman: “I've never tried insulin.” Tom Platz: “Okay.” Dennis Newman: “I've maybe taken a couple units or whatever, but it never did what everybody was doing.  It never did that for me, and I didn't want to go higher.  Just kind of really scared that so many people say that you turned diabetic from them.  And I just didn't want to take that risk. Tom Platz: “So, primarily …” [16:52] You can't turn diabetic from using insulin necessarily. It's the GH abuse that would lead to you becoming a Type II diabetic. It's interesting that this is supposed to be the insulin era, and so far, not much insulin use that I'm seeing in these interviews. I highly doubt these guys are all lying. I guess they could be, but the way they're talking about their use, it sounds pretty genuine for the most part. It's probably a misconception about how much the guys in the 90's really used Insulin, but I'm sure there were guys who were using absurd amounts in the 90's. Some of these guys with Olympia caliber genetics seem like they just hyper respond to anything they take, even at what would be considered low dosages. Tom Platz: “And then, the steroids with the GH.” Dennis Newman: “Right. Then, I heard of IGF-1 and stuff, but I never — I never tried that either.” Diuretic Use Tom Platz: “Okay. Well, next, I'd like to sort of segue into (INAUDIBLE) diuretics. I mean, is there any usage you followed or any …” Dennis Newman: “I take — right before the show, I take – I was taking Aldactone seven days out.  I think one in the morning, one in the afternoon, up until the show.  And then, I take — I think a Dyazide or …” [18:13] That's the protocol, that's the same thing that everyone's doing. That's hilarious, everyone's doing the same thing. Dennis Newman: “On Friday afternoon (INAUDIBLE) Friday night before I go to bed, and then, however, I looked in the morning, I would determine if I need another one or not.  But I use other methods like, you know, the Epsom salt baths and stuff like that.” Tom Platz: “Oh, really? Interesting.” Dennis Newman: “Just to soak up the water.  One time I did it too long and I started puking, throwing up and I couldn't stop, so I ended up taking one of those meal replacement drinks really fast (INAUDIBLE) digest in my body and then it just stopped.  That was perfect. I felt like it was (INAUDIBLE)” Tom Platz: “Yes, I can imagine.  Any problems with diuretics ever?” Dennis Newman: “No, because I've always been kind of shy on that.  But I've never – you know, I've seen guys dropped at the backstage and stuff, and I just didn't —  I thought that would be more embarrassing.  You know, I just — I just never got that far into it.” Dennis Newman's Scariest Steroid Experience Tom Platz: “How about as far as any, you know, scary or frightening episodes with any of the drugs at all? I mean …” Dennis Newman: “Yeah, I had with Winstrol.  I had two staph infections that I had to drain …”  [19:30] There you go. Tom Platz: “From injecting the same area? Dennis Newman: “From injecting — yup, same area.” [19:37] Injecting the same area is a bad idea, in general, but it seems like injectable Winstrol is the number one infection causer out of everything. Dennis Newman: “I'm, you know, running out of needles. You know, not be able to find any more, so you use the same one over. And then I use alcohol to clean it up.  It just doesn't do it.  [19:57] Well, no wonder. Dennis Newman: “You know, just sometimes you just try and you can't get nothing, nobody has anything, so …” [20:05] That's brutal. Dennis Newman: “So, I had the two operations on that.” [20:09] Can't even get clean needles? Nowadays, you can go to a needle exchange and get whatever you want for free. They accommodate drug users now, but back then, sterilizing your own needles to use them again? That's just insane. Time's have certainly changed. Dennis Newman: “And then, that was pretty much it.  All the other things — I've heard other guys, you know, puking up blood and stuff, and getting bloody noses from Anadrol and stuff like that, but that's never happened to me.” [20:37] Bloody nose from Anadrol would be high blood pressure related more than likely. If you have high blood pressure from using Dianabol, Anadrol, or any other steroid, go check your blood pressure because it's probably high. It's probably not something you should even be taking in the first place if it causes you to have bloody noses. Dennis Newman: “Abuse the drugs. I think using them and abusing them is different than –I mean, probably before a show is probably the only time I abuse if I (INAUDIBLE) more than I really need just because I want to win so bad.” Non-Steroidal and Non-Over-The-Counter Drugs Tom Platz: “Are there any non-steroidal or non-over-the-counter drugs that you find effective, like Andro or GH enhancers, or …” Dennis Newman: “Actually, I've never even really taken minerals and vitamins and stuff like that until like the first — or the last five, six years.  Before (INAUDIBLE) I figured if they're over-the-counter, they didn't work.  That's pretty much that.  And then, I think like, you know, amino acids and stuff like that, I'll just throw in, you know, just chug them, just makes me feel good to know that maybe I'm getting more extra protein and stuff, but I never really got technical with it.” Is Drug Use In Sports Accurate In The Magazines? Tom Platz: “You know, in the magazines — how accurate do you think the magazines are whenever they report about the extent of drug use in the sport and bodybuilding? Do you think they're accurate or …” Dennis Newman: “I — well, yeah, I guess so. I mean, it depends on what kind of article they're writing. If you're trying to scare somebody, yeah, there are people out there that do some crazy stuff.  I mean, I know a guy that he was taking so much stuff, he started doing squats, he was bleeding out of his ears.  And he still wanted to complete the set.  And he was like — he was taking like 6 cc's of Sustanon, like 10 Anadrol in the morning, 10 at night.  I mean, the guy was loading up on so much stuff.  And you know what, he wasn't even a bodybuilder.  He was just a skinny little kid that just wanted to get big and huge.  And his friend told him to take this and you'll grow.  And he just thought more was better, and he just started going off.” [22:53] This reminds me of the guys at the regional level that blast their faces off and do 5-6 grams of steroids when they just don't have the genetic response to get anywhere in the sport. They just keep blasting the dosages higher and higher, thinking that the secret is just more. It's evidently not the case. Dennis Newman: “When I heard about that, I just couldn't believe it.  You know, it's just ridiculous.” Dennis Newman's Take On SERMs and Aromatase Inhibitors Tom Platz: “How about like things like blocking agents?  Have you ever considered those or used those?” Dennis Newman: “You mean like Nolvadex?” Tom Platz: “Nolvadex.” Dennis Newman: “What's the other one?” Tom Platz: “Clomid.” Dennis Newman: “Clomid? No.” Tom Platz: “HCG? Things that …” Dennis Newman: “Yeah, I've heard using HCG while you're on cycle helps (INAUDIBLE) for your body's own natural testosterone to kick in, but … In this sport, you're just — you're just struggling to get what you need, you know, and who has it? And if you can afford it, and stuff like that. So, I mean, I think little things like that seem to bypass most of the time.  But when it gets — when you get ready for a show, it's one of those little things that you might need to have.” [24:06] I think this just goes to show how well-connected you needed to be in the 90's to get what you needed. I was talking about how his cycles don't seem to have rhyme or reason, but it seems it's more so because of accessibility issues, where this guy just takes what he can get, and then he just takes it as his inventory allows, or whatever he can get his hands on, he just takes. It's interesting because most bodybuilders take for granted the accessibility they all have to UGL's now, but back in the 90's it sounds like you had to scramble to find whatever you could for a contest prep. Dennis Newman: “… just to get that edge, so we like Nolvadex or what's that other one?” Tom Platz: “Clomid? Nolvadex?” Dennis Newman: “It's like Nolvadex.” Tom Platz: “HCG, you know …” [24:55] Talking about AI's? Dennis Newman: “It's a blocker.” [24:56] Arimidex, Aromasin? Tom Platz: “Proviron?” Dennis Newman: “Proviron, that's what I …” [25:00] Proviron? That's a steroid. Granted, it could work as a makeshift “blocker” via its inherent androgenicity I suppose. What is essentially just pure oral DHT does have an antagonistic effect on Estrogen. Dennis Newman: “It seemed to work good. Get the water off.” Tom Platz: “With the — when you're taking steroids?” Dennis Newman: “Right. Just prior to a contest, six to eight weeks …” Tom Platz: “In terms of — what do you …” Dennis Newman's Gynecomastia Problem Dennis Newman: “I used to have a problem with gyno, so I got it cut out.  Tom Platz: “I see. Okay.” Dennis Newman: “So, I had to — I mean, that was really always shut off —  That's what kept me away from a lot of testosterone and androgenics (INAUDIBLE) theory was basically …” [25:30] This guy is obviously Gynecomastia (gyno) prone. I would assume he probably has a genetic predisposition. Perhaps a polymorphism where his sex hormone metabolism is such that he has a higher level of aromatization than the average guy, so he can't get away with very much Testosterone. That's probably why he abused DHT derivatives as opposed to high dosages of Testosterone. I would assume the standard go-to for most of these guys is a base of Testosterone, but obviously if he's gyno prone, it makes more sense why he steers clear of Androstane. Even if you're gyno prone, you still need at least a therapeutic amount of Estradiol in there though to support basic physiological functions. Dennis Newman: “(INAUDIBLE) on a stack or cycle.  I was always on, say, two anabolics and one androgen.  And that's always worked for me, and I've heard other guys doing two androgens and, you know, one anabolic. And, you know, I just never liked that puffy, zitty kind of fat look. It just never really did anything for me.  And there was a couple of times I got to that point and, you know, I'd lose feeling in my hands and my (INAUDIBLE) and my arms, my legs would fall asleep, you know, always being in some uncomfortable position.  It was because of the water retention and I was so uncomfortable.  So, I basically stayed off of the androgens a lot, and just stuck with the anabolics.  They kept me hard, they kept the body fat down.  I always, you know, felt good, get great pumps in the gym.  I wasn't like it was (INAUDIBLE) my circulation in my arms or other body parts.  So, I stuck with the anabolics.” The Limited Knowledge In The 90's Tom Platz: “The Proviron you mentioned, the main effect of that which was useful to your program was the fact that it blocked the estrogen?” Dennis Newman: “From what they say, yeah.  I mean, I — you really don't know what the drug is actually doing because it (INAUDIBLE) to, you know, aromatize or whatever in your body, but …” [27:45] It doesn't aromatize, it acts as an antagonist to circulating estrogen to some extent. It has a very high level of androgenicity as it is essentially just oral DHT. It's prescribed as a treatment for men with androgen deficiency. Most notably being low libido. In the absence of physiological amounts of estrogen in the first place though, it doesn't really serve a purpose in that regard. If you have zero Estrogen, you can slam yourself with as much Proviron as you want and your dick will still be a noodle. Dennis Newman: “Yeah, they said — I was told that it blocks off the estrogen from, you know, making in your body, and it also had some anabolic effects.” [28:21] Again, this just goes to show how the limited scope of knowledge back then didn't limit the growth potential of these guys significantly. They explode without even knowing what they're really taking. They're just taking what they have access to randomly like this guy. I'm not knocking this guy whatsoever. If I was in the 90's, I'm sure I wouldn't even know one-tenth of what I know now, because the information simply wasn't accessible. It's interesting to see how everyone thought these guys' had the “secrets” and they must use 10 times more than everybody else. I think it was just a hyper response to drugs, training, and crazy genetics in general to be honest. Dennis Newman: “So, that was helping from catabolic effects from eating the muscles, stuff like that.  So, I took that (INAUDIBLE) 1 IU's of that rather than Nolvadex which was just a blocker. I want both worlds, you know?” Dennis Newman's Take On Roid Rage Tom Platz: “I understand. Your opinion of the roid rage syndrome, is that something that really does occur?” Dennis Newman: “You know what, I — my opinion is, I think a lot of guys are weak when it comes in the mind.  And I think they use that as an excuse — yes, maybe in my — I mean, I've controlled it pretty good.  And I've never — I don't think I consider myself having roid rages even when I'm on stuff, because I know how it should feel what I'm feeling and like I think maybe when you're unaware of what your on (INAUDIBLE) steroid and stuff, maybe you would tend to get angry and overdo it.  But maybe in the younger crowd, but if you know what you're doing and you know what you're taking, I think you can control it.  But I think a lot of people out there they want — they want to be, you know, strong or, you know, I don't know, maybe it's a macho thing or something.  I just (INAUDIBLE) this rage and connect with me.  You know, when they — I mean, especially, when a woman uses it against you and that — I mean, you're pissed and it isn't so much the drugs, it's just — it's just an argument.  And then they start pointing the finger (INAUDIBLE) to your roid — you're on the roids, man.  Those roids are making you this way.  You're just like — but it's not — but, yeah, it's a lose-lose situation when that comes around. Tom Platz: “Obviously, I think you probably feel that steroids are necessary and GH is necessary to some degree to compete in today's stage?” Dennis Newman: “Exactly, yeah.  But when they're taken out of hand, then that's when the roid rages and all the other side effects probably happen.” Esiclene Use Tom Platz: “How about things like the Esiclene where they inject into the muscle for temporary …” Dennis Newman: “Inflammatories?”  Tom Platz: “Yeah, inflammatory type drugs?” Dennis Newman: “I've tried that, actually.  In fact, it just — I don't know if I'm not putting it in right or what, but these guys, I've heard they inject themselves everywhere about, you know, weak points that they have in their body and stuff.  But I don't know, I think it's just a cheating way of doing it.  I feel like if you can't do it, you know, natural — not naturally, but if you can't do it that way, and try to form your body by building it, you know, it's just cheating, you know? It doesn't look right anyways, because it takes away the cuts anyway, you know what I mean? You can usually tell who's pumping their stuff up, you know, so …  I don't like (INAUDIBLE) because I like the, you know, the good look, you know?” Tom Platz: “I understand?  I guess that would probably be the same thing as doing implants to some degree that looks like …” Dennis Newman: “It's not real. And it doesn't look good when it's flexed.  Maybe for some people, it does, but I'm not going to go that far in competing. Steroids are bad enough.” The Bodybuilding Chemical Warfare Tom Platz: “In your opinion, do you feel that the bodybuilding stage that we're pushing genetics to the ultimate edge?” Dennis Newman: “Yeah, I think it's gone a little too far.  I think if you compare the 80's, or the, you know, 70's and 80's bodybuilders compared to the 90's, there — I think in the judging is basically pushing people (INAUDIBLE) you know, out the door, man.  They're croaking because of a certain look that they want to look like, you know? I mean, they need to take it down some.” Tom Platz: “So what you're saying is the judges are judging the drug look?” Dennis Newman: “Yeah, exactly.” [32:47] It's funny because this message is literally what's making men's physique and classic physique popular in modern day, but this is over 20 years ago, and they were already talking about this, and it still sustained itself for another 20 years before the tide started turning. Even now, they still favor the mass monster open bodybuilding category. And still, the biggest draw of the show is the open bodybuilding class. They were already talking about how the size game was overkill back in '96, or whenever this was. Foreshadowing for the future. Tom Platz: “So, get my drug look to do well, right? Dennis Newman: “Right. Right.” Tom Platz: “I'm just — I'm not — I don't mean to paraphrase you, but it's …” Dennis Newman: “Yeah, it's the drug look, basically. I mean, you can tell who's doing more and who's not.” Dennis Newman On Steroid Use In Sports Dennis Newman: “And in all sports, too. It's not just bodybuilding. I mean, the Olympics, they got ways of disguising these drugs. And they're the best at it anyway, so they got to hire people to do this. So, we're the rug rats compared to this.” Tom Platz: “Yeah, I know what you're saying. Okay, well, is there any other comments you care to share with our viewers along the lines of — I mean, you said quite a bit already. Is there anything else that you care to add?” Dennis Newman: “You know, these steroids are, you know, they're just like any other drug. I mean, you can get addicted to it. Most of the bodybuilders that you see that are on them, are pretty much addicted to them because they just don't want to stop looking the way they do. And if you're going to take steroids, I think, man, you need to be mentally prepared for, you know, the consequences that they come with. And, you know, if you abuse your body, and you take more stuff than you should, you know, if you're doing something right or wrong. Trying it and loading it up is two different things. You just got to be careful because nobody is going to tell you what to do, but you definitely need to be smart about it.” Dennis Newman's Formula For Success Tom Platz: “I guess the question I have for you at this point would be, what is your formula for success? And how do you — what would you — can you put that in a few statements?” Dennis Newman: “I think, look in the mirror, find somebody in the magazine that you resemble or what you would like to look like. And, you know, go to the gym, start out — start working out and start noticing, you know, gains in your body, and just get around (INAUDIBLE) see if, you know, but just know how to supplement your bodybuilding with your lifestyle, so you don't let it overpower your whole life and make people miserable in your — you know, who's in love with you and stuff like that, because that tends to happen a lot. As far as, like, you know, being so dedicated, that you can't do anything in your life. But you know, putting (INAUDIBLE) hour and a half, you need to be intensive in the gym, and that's it. And then, outside of that, it's just eating, and dedicate yourself to, you know, eating good foods and a lot of protein. And it's pretty — you can have fun with it, and don't be miserable by doing it.” Are Pros With More Money More Likely To Win Competitions? Tom Platz: “One question I have for you is, do you feel that, you know, whoever has the most money and afford the most GH, and related to drugs is the winner, or could be the winner? Dennis Newman: “Of course, because just like any kind of — like car race or jet ski race, anybody that has the more technology and the more money to spend on that engine, basically, if you can afford more horsepower, so you're going to win the race. And that's got a lot to do with bodybuilding in any other sport. It's who has the resources, most resources and who can afford the resources. It's really — and it takes genetics, but the people that do have the genetics, those are the people that can afford that stuff. And they just keep getting nice — like the rich keep getting richer and the poor get — keep getting poorer.” Tom Platz: “That's an interesting point. So, like building a race engine almost. If you're winning at the track and …” Dennis Newman: “We can't put in regular gas. You got to put in super unleaded. If you can afford super unleaded and if you — you know, and you got a connection on that, then you're going to be a better athlete. But that's where the strategies — that's why you don't hear anybody talking about what they do with the drugs and what they do with the diet and all that kind of stuff. They kind of — they do tell you — they lead you around in another direction. And nobody really wants to tell you, which is insecure with themselves and they really don't care.” Tom Platz: “Yeah. But then again, you know, I mean, that's again the purpose of this video production, is to address it like it — in terms of what's really happening, and say things like we are not able to say in other forms.” Dennis Newman: “Yeah. Well, people don't want to hear it. Yeah, I think it's BS because a lot of (INAUDIBLE) when they do tell you (INAUDIBLE) you guess a lot. Tom Platz: “Right, exactly.” Dennis Newman: “Yeah, it's not the truth.” Protein, Carbohydrate, And Fat Macronutrient Ratios Tom Platz: “In terms of nutritional ratio — nutritional ratios, protein related to carbohydrates and fats, do you have any ideas or strong feelings about those ratios?” Dennis Newman: “Usually, when I'm trying to stay lean in the offseason, let's say I'm off of everything (INAUDIBLE) and trying to clean myself out, I'll stick more to lighter foods like chicken, fish, you know, any kind of shellfish and stuff like that, and potatoes and rice. And then, when I'm on like, my cycling for, you know, getting bigger for the contest and stuff, I'll stick to more red meats. Still, with the rice, maybe up my fats a little more. And then (INAUDIBLE) kicking the aerobics is when I just start kicking in all the protein. I'll just take in mostly protein. I kind of — like in the morning, I'll have a little bit (INAUDIBLE) my carbs and stuff, I'll have like a lot of eggs, egg whites and egg yolks with it, whole eggs, and then maybe some — like a small bowl of oatmeal and some fruit. And then, the next meal I'll have just a protein shake, and then maybe a couple scoops of peanut butter or, you know, for lunch, maybe a steak and — a really fat steak or something like that, and maybe a potato and some vegetables. And then after that, I'll just keep eating more protein, protein shakes, and like more chicken and rice maybe even before I work out, then after that, just protein and vegetables.” Caloric Intake And Counting Calories Tom Platz: “In terms of calories per day? If there is some offseason (INAUDIBLE) Dennis Newman: “I've taken about — in the offseason, I really don't care. I don't care. Frankly, I just eat the protein and then whatever fats in there is just in there. You know, if I need to cut back or get leaner, if I feel a little fat, I just cut out the carbs. I won't eat the carbs, I'll just have like maybe a couple of chicken breasts and some salad or something. And if I (INAUDIBLE) get fat from that then I'll just maybe switch it to a steak or something if I feel like, you know, I'm getting too lean or, you know, if I feel like my muscles aren't full enough. So, I'll try and get some of that Creatine out of the steak and pump up a little bit. It makes me feel a little harder and bigger. Each food just does different stuff to me and whatever mood I'm in or whatever how I feel, my body feels. I kind of just judge it by that and I eat whatever I think I need. Because after all these years, you kind of figure out what should, you know, you run on.” Tom Platz: “Do you count calories before a show?” Dennis Newman: “No, I never count calories. I never write down anything. I feel like if, you know, your body is different, I mean, you don't burn the same amount of calories every day, why should you eat the same amount?” Tom Platz: “So, you don't really — grams of protein, carbohydrates, or fat, you don't have those grams recorded and …” Dennis Newman: “No, pretty much… Especially, when you know, I run on GH, it's pretty much, you know … Only probably the last week, the last week prior to the show, I mean. I'm more self-conscious of the amount of chicken breast and the amount of carbs and the amount of fat. I'll take a, you know, 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and stuff and have the same amount that (INAUDIBLE) And then if I need to adjust anything, I just adjust, you know, either pose a little harder that day, or sweat a little bit more, or burn a little more calories, and I just keep everything else the same. How Effective Growth Hormone Is For Fat Loss Tom Platz: “You mentioned the GH, though, when you're on GH, you feel that you can almost eat anything you want?” Dennis Newman: “Oh, yeah. 16 weeks out from a show, I did that one show. Yeah, I was eating cake, ice cream after my meals and stuff. And it was weird because if I didn't eat that, I felt like I was doing like away. And so, it's like — you know, I heard other people doing this, too. I mean, and I was just getting harder and looking better and better. And it was — it was amazing, I was tripping. [41:48] I feel like that's a gross exaggeration of how effective 4 IU's of GH is at fat burning. GH induced Lipolysis works, but it's not the end-all, be-all. Other fat burners are far more effective, in my opinion. GH is really hyped up as this crazy, insane, body transforming drug, but in actual practical application, it doesn't really add a significant amount of tissue. It helps you stay leaner as you bulk up, which is helpful obviously, but as far as ripping fat off your body, that comes down to caloric intake mostly. Other fat burners are more efficacious for actually dipping into stored body fat and pulling it out like Clenbuterol, Cytomel (T3), etc., Not that any of these drugs are healthy, but I feel like those are more effective fat burning agents than GH. I'm kind of surprised when guys say they can eat whatever they want on GH. I think they're just not hungry enough to eat at an amount that they would gain weight on. It's pretty easy to get fat on GH if you really tried to be honest. Well, if your appetite doesn't suck. Tom Platz: “That's amazing.” Dennis Newman: “Yeah. So, I mean, that's where you get addicted to the drugs because you do see how they really work, especially (INAUDIBLE) right before a show. You see the difference what it does to you. And that's what pretty much convinces you that saying no doesn't mean no haha.” Tom Platz: “What do we mean saying no doesn't mean no?” Dennis Newman: “Yeah, not saying — not saying no to drugs hahahaha.” Tom Platz: “Hahaha I understand. Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you very much for helping us out today. Conclusion On Dennis Newman's Steroid Cycle [43:37] That was a bit more unique than I expected. Dennis, being super gyno prone and only favoring DHT derivatives, even in the offseason, which is super contrary to what you'd expect for a growth phase. Evidently, if you have insane genetics, you can pretty much get away with anything. I think this is a good example of that. This gives us an interesting insight into what the UGL scene was like back then too, where it was so hard to get what you need. Highly acclaimed pro bodybuilders even had great difficulty getting their hands on certain compounds. They don't even seem to have predetermined stacks and cycles either. It was “use whatever you can get.” That seems pretty much what it was with the accessibility in the 90's. Dennis Newman's Steroid Cycle After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Dennis Newman's steroid cycle dosages pre-contest, he claims his use broke down to the following:  Testosterone Cypionate – 200 mg twice a week = 400 mg/week Sustanon – 250 mg twice a week = 500 mg/week Testosterone Enanthate – 200 mg twice a week = 400 mg/week Anavar – 25-30 mg a day Parabolan – Two 76 mg Parabolan amps per week = 152 mg/week Primobolan – 1 shot every 3 days = 200 mg/week Winstrol – 50 mg a day = 350 mg/week Halotestin – Used pre-contest, the dosage was not disclosed. My educated guess is that he probably used between 20-40 mg per day for the last 2-3 weeks of his contest prep. Growth Hormone – Tried it twice with a dosage as high as 4 IU per day Insulin – Tried a couple IU as an experiment but didn't want to increase the dosage higher than that   Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

    "content": "Reacting To And Analyzing Chris Cormier’s Steroid Cycle In The 90’s     This interview discussing Chris Cormier's steroid cycle was recorded by Tom Platz in the 90's. The guys that can best shed light on exactly what happened in the bodybuilding community in the 90's are the same guys who've been at the Olympia level and have Olympia caliber physiques. Every single one of these interviews has been extremely eye opening. People can guess all they want what these guys took, but at the end of the day, hearing it from their mouths themselves is the best way we can actually figure out what happened and make an educated assessment for our own use moving forward. The whole point of this video is to bring to light the truth of the matter on steroid use.

This is just what the internet seems to think based on mannerisms, how he sounds and how he looks underneath the filter. Tom Platz: “We'll address a lot of sensitive issues today.  And I want to assure you that your identity will be protected in terms of the viewing audience, okay? It's important to me, otherwise, I wouldn't agree to do this.  So often, the issue is not addressed.  The steroid issue in all sports from today is avoided, not addressed, not talked about as if it doesn't exist.  And having seen a lot of close friends of mine encounter some problems recently, I feel, personally strongly that the issue should be addressed in terms of honesty, in terms of education for future upcoming athletes.  And that's not that enough.  So, if we can do that today, which we will by not exploiting who you — who you're — who you really are, and if (INAUDIBLE) openly and honestly, that's the reason I would — that's the way I would like to proceed, and that's the reason I'm here in the first place.  And I hope you understand that, and I do thank you very much for being here and agreeing to be candid with us.  And of course, with your identity completely disguised.” Chris Cormier: “Thanks.” Tom Platz: “Thank you. What Prompted Chris Cormier To Use Steroids Tom Platz: “First of all, I — the question I have to ask you is what brought you to the steroid table in the first place?” Chris Cormier: “Well, it's — when I was young, I always liked muscles, always intrigued by strength and the whole, you know, cartoon character look, and you know, the strength, you know, just muscle in general.  And I didn't know much about anything that can, you know, help you get bigger or whatever, other than the protein drinks and the liver pills, and you know, that was available through the stores at the time.  I was lifting weights as a kid, I started at a young age.  And once I got to college, someone pointed out a visual who was pretty large.  And he said, “Yes, he takes anabolic steroids.”  So, right then and there, I was like, you know, “Okay, I got to find out what this is about,” you know?  So, I started reading about it and looking at the different bodybuilders in the magazines.  And you know, feeling okay, this is what — you know, this is what's going on.  So, I read about it for a few years before trying it.” Tom Platz: “How old were you when you first started your first steroid cycle?” Chris Cormier: “I was 18.” Tom Platz: “Okay, and I was — you were competing then?” [04:26] I believe Chris is the youngest so far out of all of these interviews. Chris Cormier: “I competed before I took anything.  I was like training for about five or so years, and I start competing for about two years.  You know, people are taking steroids this and that.  You know, I was like, man, maybe that's why I'm, you know, taking a second and not winning or something like that.  I didn't — I didn't have any idea what was, you know, what was behind, you know, getting that harder look as a muscle or lose more water between the muscle and the skin, and everything.” Tom Platz: “Okay. So, it was basically in order to compete on the bodybuilding stage for everyone else is doing it (INAUDIBLE) have to do it to get that edge, is that — am I hearing you correctly?”  Chris Cormier: “Basically. And you know I wanted to see, you know, what would happen if I took more — or if I took something, or whatever, you know, just like everyone else is doing. So, I — but like I said, I tried to take this model route and at least be educated about what I was getting into and (INAUDIBLE) like I said, I read about it for good two years, two and a half years before I tried anything.” Chris Cormier's Dianabol and Equipoise Use Tom Platz: “Okay. Again, proceeding with our — the basic statements and thoughts we were aligning ourselves with.  My next question would be what kind of steroids by name have you found most effective in your training?” Chris Cormier: “Right now or back then?” Tom Platz: “Well, I guess all through the course of your career.” Chris Cormier: “Dianabol, which is always a, you know, like the first thing a lot of people take or …” [6:15] Dianabol was a staple of the 70's and 80's-era. Chris Cormier: “And, you know, a personal favorite. That Equipoise.” [6:28] I think he's the first one who said to have used Equipoise or EQ. It's interesting because I don't even know if I'd combine those, to be honest. Dianabol is just the oral version of the same drug essentially, and they both fulfill the same pathway of growth in the body, so their benefits overlap more so than having an additive effect to one another. Anyway, I'm going to let him continue before I comment too much. Parabolan (Trenbolone) Use Chris Cormier: “… is a regular Testosterone (INAUDIBLE) types of — types of Testosterone Cypionate and things of that nature.  Winstrol and the more hardening drugs like that. Say, back then, we can get stuff like Finajet and, you know, different things like that.” [7:14] I don't know what he just said, but I'm pretty sure it was Finajet, which is a brand name of Trenbolone. The human approved version was Parabolan made in France by Negma. After that was discontinued, what a lot of guys did was they would get Finaplix H pellets, which are still available for veterinary use in beefing up cattle. People would use these conversion kits to change these pellets into injectable solutions of Trenbolone. I believe that is the origin of how veterinary use migrated into human use following the discontinuation of pharma grade Trenbolone products. If you actually go to Merck's website, you can still see Finaplix H pellets that are sold for beefing up cattle. Parabolan was the human approved Trenbolone and that was discontinued in the 90's. I guess they started to go towards the veterinary stuff after that. EQ is also a veterinary drug, at least in modern times. Chris Cormier: “But a lot of (INAUDIBLE) it's hard to find now. There's a number of — you know, people kind of tried, but now it's go for what's available, what you think is real, or, you know, sometimes a lot of things are not even real, what's your taking and you thought he's taking something.”  Tom Platz: “Yeah.” [8:55] It sounds like the accessibility was limited back then. These guys take what they can get kind of thing. It's interesting because these are all top Olympia competitors being interviewed. For them to say, “you take what you can find and what's available,” it's crazy to hear that they had availability issues. You can just imagine what the average Joe would go through trying to get good gear back then if even the top pros had access issues. Tom Platz: “That's definitely a concern. I can — I can understand that. Well, and — so basically, it's what's available and what you can get a hold of and hopefully it's real.” Chris Cormier: “Well, Parabolans and Primobolan, you see they would get like back in the day, there's — the growth hormone was not playing a key role in a lot of people's arsenal.” Tom Platz: “Yes, that's like …” Chris Cormier: “And you know …” Growth Hormone Use And Dosage Tom Platz: “Let's talk about like currently, what you're using and what kind of dosages you might be using in terms of the androgenic and the anabolic material as such.” Chris Cormier: “Currently, I could take growth hormone and use about 9 IUs a day.” Tom Platz: “How long might that be for?” Chris Cormier: “As long as you can afford.” Tom Platz: “Yes, I can understand that. Is that prior to a contest only?” [10:23] 9 IUs, that's pretty high definitely, in my opinion. Chris Cormier: “You know, I've used it in the whole season, I use it for competition.” Tom Platz: “What's better results where?” Chris Cormier: “I like to use it during — getting ready for competition because (INAUDIBLE) seem to burn all my body fat.  And, you know, your energy levels are high, your nitrogen levels are high, and, you know, you have — you're really energetic and, you know, strong, and …” Tom Platz: “Can you get any one to …” [10:52] It's interesting to hear him say “energetic” because I feel for most people, once you get over 4 or 5 IUs of high quality, pharma-grade GH, you get tired and lethargic. You release the most GH when you're sleeping, this is a hormone that makes you tired and spikes your blood sugar. This isn't something that gives you tons of energy as a pre-workout drug, so it's kind of interesting to hear him say that. Typically, one of the biggest limiting factors for people using growth hormone is insulin resistance and lethargy. Tom Platz: “… you're on growth hormone? You eat anything you want to?”  Chris Cormier: “I do anyway. You know, I — you know, I tend to be able to cheat a little bit more. And we're getting really good results from it, yes.” Anadrol Use Chris Cormier: “And that's my favorite drug, Anadrol, the different types of Anadrol that's available now.” Tom Platz: “Staying with it, before we go on to the steroids, the GH or the growth hormone. It's like, if you're — I realized if you could take it all-year long, you take it all-year long if you could afford it (INAUDIBLE) just — am I hearing you …” Chris Cormier: “I probably wouldn't myself. You know, I'm not like a person who would — you know, that's my favorite thing to do is take a lot of drugs, and you know, this type of new drug …” Tom Platz: “God. I don't mean — I don't mean to say it that like …” Chris Cormier: “Well, no. I don't know, I probably could if I were, you know, but that's very expensive to do something like that.” [12:29] Doing 9 units year-round, you would probably end up in danger zone for insulin resistance, in my opinion. Just a heads up on that. Tom Platz: “… for an event nowadays. Like say, we'd want name (INAUDIBLE)” Chris Cormier: “How far out or?” Tom Platz: “How far out?”  Chris Cormier: “Maybe 12 weeks out?” Tom Platz: “Okay. 12 weeks out, 9 IUs a day, yeah?  It's — I'm sure it's pricey, for sure.” Chris Cormier: “Yeah.” Chris Cormier's Offseason Steroids Tom Platz: “Now, moving on from the growth hormone, stepping back into the steroid arena, prior to an event, are the steroids different than they would be in the offseason?” Chris Cormier: “You would cycle… my — personally, I would start out like 15 weeks out if I have my way.” Tom Platz: “Okay. Let's go …” Chris Cormier: “15 weeks out then I use the heavier, more water retention type substances about — for the — for like a Dbol, like Equipoise, Anadrol.” Clenbuterol, Winstrol, and Cytomel Use Chris Cormier: “I use Clenbuterol with (INAUDIBLE) I would start switching to more hard …” [13:37] Clenbuterol 15 weeks out is interesting because I feel like most guys wouldn't add that in until closer to the tail end of a contest prep. Everything else he's saying is pretty consistent with the other guys as far as long esters and things that hold more nitrogen as well as more water retention further out from the show. Chris Cormier: “… hardening things like Halotestin and Cytogen, and Winstrol and …” [14:07] Halotestin and Winstrol I'm aware of. I don't know what Cytogen is though. Chris Cormier: “Primobolan and say Cytomel, I will start that. [14:19] Cytomel is T3. Chris Cormier: “That's all of my — when I want to — when I'm starting the phase and taking a little harder.”  Tom Platz: “Which is like?”  Chris Cormier: “Usually, when around 8 to 6 weeks out. I started out — the Cytogen, I'll take it like five weeks out or something like that.  And that's even pushing a little bit.” Chris Cormier's Vague Dosing Tom Platz: “Okay. Do you usually start with a lower dosage, go high and then regress or …” Chris Cormier: “I just — I don't take a lot of (INAUDIBLE)  Like for testosterone, I will probably take about maybe a couple of cc's twice a week or something like that.” [14:55] See, it's funny, something I'm realizing is that most of these guys quantify just in volume, not even the doses. They're saying a cc here, a cc here, 2 cc's a week. Tom has to dig to get an answer in milligrams. It's interesting how they quantify things back then in cc's as if one dose is one cc, which is interesting. Chris Cormier: “You know, a lot of people might take more or less a little bit.  Testosterone now I've always — or I at a young age even I was told to take as little as possible to get the effects that you're looking for.  So, I was, that's my — my first instinct is to do that with most of the drugs that I take.  And then, from there, I would, you know, if 4 IUs is not working for me, or if I'd say 200 mg is not good for me, I'll go up to 400 mg, or you know, something like that.” Tom Platz: “Do you have a formula like a daily milligram allotment or do you …” Chris Cormier: “I used to. I used to. Now, it's just like, “Okay, Mondays and — Mondays and Thursdays, I'm going to be doing this and that. I'm going to kick in this whatever, and I'm also looking at the mirror seeing over the years, you learn how to, you know, say hey, I'm holding a lot more water from — you know, this might be a reason, so I'm going to take that out, and put this in.  You know, so like a recipe or something.” Chris Cormier's Steroid Dosages Tom Platz: “Okay. Like, in the offseason with the — more strength-enhancing, the bulking type agents or drugs.  Give me some idea, if you would, please, if you would share with us some idea of the dosages of those things, and then we'll move on to the pre-contest.” Chris Cormier: “Well, testosterone can be anywhere from, say, 600 mg, 800 mg a week of testosterone.  Primobolan, I like to take about, say, 400 mg a week.  Equipoise I would probably do like a full — syringe full twice — two times a week.” Tom Platz:  “Full syringe meaning what?” Chris Cormier: “It depends — like say — like, say, it depends like if it's like 50 mg or whatever.  But, you know, Equipoise is not — it's not like really high on androgens.  And it was like a mixture of both.  And so, I kind of just (INAUDIBLE) cc's two to three times a week of that. For I was kicking some …” [17:42] I don't know if the EQ was concentrated at 50 mg/ml. It's kind of interesting because pretty much every UGL does 200 to 300 mg, and then here he's talking about 50 mg unless I'm misinterpreting what he said. It sounds so far, we're at 1,600 to 2,000 mg approximately per week. Chris Cormier: “Growth Hormone and I would do, say, 4 — I still go around 4 IUs per day and work my way up to 9 or so …” Tom Platz: “The growth hormone does go up and then stops.” Chris Cormier: “Yeah. You know what, I like to go about 8 to 10 weeks with growth hormone. And then once you start to come off of it, you start, you know, you lose a little bit of water.  But the size and strength usually stays pretty good with the growth hormone. My offseason cycles, now I like to take around four to five different types of steroids at one time.” Tom Platz: “Is it two androgenic and two anabolic or …?” Chris Cormier: “And even more even — yeah, I keep it pretty even like that, yeah. Tom Platz: “Offseason? And as you move into the season, the heavier androgenics come out to some degree?” Chris Cormier: “Yeah, I do it that way and then — but at the same time, you know, I — like for decades.  And I would — I would probably do, say, about 400 mg or — 400 to 800 mg per week of the deca alone.” Tom Platz: “And that's usually starting closer to the contest. Chris Cormier: “Right, exactly.” Pro-Bodybuilder Dosages Vs Average Bodybuilder Dosages [19:17] These doses are all pretty standard honestly. Some of these are even low. I know tons of guys who think EQ is useless under 700 mg, they think Primobolan is useless under 900 mg, Deca is 400 mg minimum, and all these crazy preconceived notions. These guys are using pretty much normal gym rats are using plus some GH. The steroid use itself is pretty interesting. Tom Platz: “Okay. So, before a contest, it might mean eight weeks in, the Deca, you mentioned I think Winstrol, and that would be like cc's of that would be, approximately? Chris Cormier: “See, that's — again, that's usually 50 mg per bottle you're taking.  About two or three bottles per time, like two times a week or so. Tom Platz: “Okay. So, if you're using two …” [20:18] So, the Winstrol is 50 mg/ml and 2 to 3 bottles a few times a week, so you're at 300 to 450 per week, approximately. Chris Cormier's Hardening Agents Tom Platz: “… androgenics and two anabolics prior to — during the offseason.  Before the event eight weeks in, you're using more hardening agents, as you call it, and no more anabolics.  And that would be how many agents, roughly? I know it changes from …” Chris Cormier: “That depends on what's available at the time and what's in your budget for your competition. So, let's say, you know, if you're training for a show, and you have — you have Halotestin, Cytogen, some type of …” Tom Platz: “Halotestin?” Chris Cormier: “… Clenbuterol. Halotestin, I'd like to take about 30 to 40 mg per day.” [21:13] I've always heard guys say, don't go over 20 mg because 20 mg is a threshold where you start getting into a really toxic territory, and to only use it two weeks out. 30 to 40 mg, that seems pretty high, but that's something I have a lot less experience researching, to be honest. It seems like a pretty high dose for that. Chris Cormier: “I start it for about five weeks out or so.” Tom Platz: “Okay. That is a hardening type agent.” Chris Cormier: “Yeah. And Cytogen, that's about four weeks out, and I'm starting our different (INAUDIBLE) milligrams, and you take in — you start up (INAUDIBLE) going up to two — I've got two on one off with that.  That's pretty hard on your system, so you want to kind of, you know, not stay on it too long.  And then the Cytogen — the Cytomel also — it's also needed for the extra body fat that you're burning.  And also, it works really well with the growth hormone also.” Nolvadex and Proviron Use Chris Cormier: “And I would say (INAUDIBLE) you know, stick on Nolvadex and Proviron, stuff like that for extra hardening effects. You know, I've used both of those with — at different times. And what else?” Tom Platz: “Well — so many different ways to go in this.” I mean — so is there any time during the year when you, for sure, don't take steroids and …” Chris Cormier: “Right after — well, coming out to competition like the last week or so, discard all the steroids and, you know, you tend to look harder because it's all making you hold some kind of water, some kind of — in some kind of area.” Tom Platz: “Is there a number of months during the year that you don't take steroids at all?” Chris Cormier: “Yeah, I've done — and I've done that during the course of my career.  I've — actually, I've taken a lot of time off.  Sometimes I would take a 12-week cycle, and I would go off for 12 weeks. You know, and I would …” Tom Platz: “So, there's no exact (INAUDIBLE) change in …” Chris Cormier: “Right, right.  It changes, and as you develop and grow bigger and you start to change the way you do a lot of things and take a lot different things, and you know?” Chris Cormier's Take On Insulin Use Tom Platz: “Since we've been speaking about GH to some degree already offseason or on season, we discussed drugs, steroids in terms of offseason versus on season.  And whatever your cyclic pattern, which changes a great deal.  My next question would be insulin, is that ever a consideration in your program?” Chris Cormier: “Yes, I've used it for a contest prep, as far as I starting my off cycles off with, you know, helping you gain a little bit more weight before you start to cut down.  And (INAUDIBLE) works, you know, really well.  It's just really dangerous for people to use it.  And you really have to know what you're doing if you're starting to step into that arena.” Tom Platz: “So, you only take it when you're getting size?” Chris Cormier: “I did that, but I also took it to, you know, carb-up phase during competition.” Tom Platz: “Okay, but you don't take it other than maybe the last week before the show then?” Chris Cormier: “On the last year — yeah, the last — within the last week, the last few days before the show.” Tom Platz: “And then maybe in the offseason for how long?” Chris Cormier: “For a few weeks. I never — I never took a long cycle. I went — it's not my favorite thing to do.” [24:52] See, it's interesting because a lot of guys think that these guys are on Lantus with their GH pretty much year-round to gain massive amounts of size, and crank their IGF-1 up. It seems like the insulin use is actually really conservative, or perhaps it's just the taboo drug, so no one wants to come clean about how they actually use it. I don't really know for sure, but no one seems to have very aggressive insulin use so far, and that's out of every person in this series. Chris Cormier: “Doing all that stuff, you know, watching yourself if you're going to fall asleep or not. It's just — it's really — it's really dangerous, and …” Insulin Dosage Tom Platz: “About dosage as far as insulin?” Chris Cormier: “Dosages, I would — I would go about — if I was going to take it in the offseason I would do about three or — three or four times a day. And I would space it out every six hours or so for about 12 to 15 IUs I believe or so.” Tom Platz: “Okay. I'm not sure the …” Chris Cormier: “On a syringe, you will see 10, 20, 30. I would take within — between 10 and 20. No more than that though.” Tom Platz: “And that was …” [26:05] 12 the 15 IUs three times a day? That's a pretty considerable amount, granted the duration of time though, you would assume these guys are using it much more than just a few sporadic times for carbing up or for a few weeks a year for hypertrophy. The dosing schedule is more in line with what I'd expect though, utilizing several doses throughout the day of probably a fast-acting insulin with each meal. Although, I was expecting somebody to have been on a longer acting Insulin based around all of their meals in a day, but it doesn't seem like anyone's doing that in this series. Tom Platz: “Three times a day?” Chris Cormier: “Three times a day? Early in the morning then soon after, only then in the evening.” Tom Platz: “Is it after workout, before working out?” Chris Cormier: “I've done it — I've tried it that way also. I tried it in the middle of my workout even.  And so, on your time (INAUDIBLE) for within that 20 minutes, you're going to be done and you're gonna start eating, and that seemed to work pretty good too.  But I just — I'm not really, you know ventured into getting really serious about doing the insulin deal.” Tom Platz: “So, it's just sort of something you played with.” Chris Cormier: “Yeah, played with, but never really seriously seen the actual effects of what can — what can be done with …” [27:19] For somebody on 9 IUs of GH though, again, that's somebody who could probably benefit from insulin, not just in a performance-enhancing context, but health standpoint, because there's a lot of stress on your pancreas if you have chronically elevated blood sugar from that much growth hormone all day. Chris Cormier: “I do know the dangerous sides of it. You know, because I've seen a lot of people get a lot of — a lot of bad reactions from it, and I've been in dangerous — put yourself in dangerous positions from it.  I've seen it firsthand, so I do know not to mess with it too much.” Aldactone Use Tom Platz: “Okay. Well, the next item I'd like to discuss with you would be the use of diuretics.  Is that (INAUDIBLE) been something you've utilized?” Chris Cormier: “Well, I've used that since I was a teenager, I started using it.  It's — I've never really had a problem with it. I never took a lot — I never took over 75 mg of like Aldactone. 75 mg has been the most I've taken per day of that (INAUDIBLE) my body is very sensitive to a lot of water. And I never had a lot of problems with cramping or anything like that, that lot of people have associated with diuretic use.” Tom Platz: “The Aldactone is used at the last week prior to a show?” Dyazide Use Chris Cormier: “I started — yes, like the Tuesday on to the show.  And then like, say, like a Friday or so, I would start with a little bit of Dyazide.  You have guys open up Dyazide caps and empty a little …” [28:59] That's the classic protocol. Again, it's the same diuretic protocol you see time and time again. It seems everyone's more or less doing the same thing. The difference comes down to genetics it seems like at the end of the day. I feel like that's definitely the takeaway message from this series. Chris Cormier: “Out of it so it wouldn't be as strong as normal.  And that's something I've always been really sensitive about taking because it tend to take a long …” [29:25] If I was competing for example, and I was going to do a peak week, I would avoid Aldactone. I think it sucks, personally. The half a Dyazide the night before if you actually need it makes sense, but I feel a week out, you should be lean enough and already stage ready and just cruise into the show. I feel Aldactone has more negatives than positives. The Dyazide more than accomplishes the goal of getting that extra crispy, dry, grainy look that the Aldactone might achieve, but it's a lot harder to fill out on Aldactone, at least in my experience. I feel like it's a subpar diuretic that's overly used. That's just my personal opinion, though. Chris Cormier: “(INAUDIBLE) water out of the muscle also is, you know, is just as much as it takes it from — between the muscle and the skin.  You're going to lose a bit of size, and so I've never been, you know, a big fan on taking a lot of milligrams in terms of diuretics.” Tom Platz: “But mainly, prior to an event, you find that it's Aldactone and a little Dyazide is effective?” Chris Cormier: “Yeah, very effective, very effective. And the difference between a couple places if you didn't take it, definitely. Chris Cormier's Take On Diuretic Testing In The 90's Tom Platz: “Now, that I understand they're testing for diuretics in the Olympia only, exclusively, how to get around that?” Chris Cormier: “They've done it for most.  Sometimes if you go to a show and they don't test us — well, you don't — you don't know about it, though, and you know, who's to say if, you know, if they really tested for it or not, but you know, there are times when people have gotten caught for taking things.” Tom Platz: “Is there any specific way that there are masking agent for diuretics or a way to get around the …”  Chris Cormier: “Not that I know of. Not that I know of.  I think if you lower your sodium a lot more than normal and play with that, that number and take the — a lot of the natural diuretics that's available over the counter. That with a combination with the (INAUDIBLE) and you know, it's hard — I've used insulin and the insulin tends to suck a little bit of water from — into the muscle from in between the skin and the muscle.  So, that would still — the muscle fibers looked as if as though the skin is tighter around it.” Tom Platz: “This is with …” Chris Cormier: “(INAUDIBLE) I use insulin and the …” Tom Platz: “And diuretic?” Chris Cormier:  “With — the natural diuretics, you know, (INAUDIBLE) together to make — give you a pretty good tight look.” Tom Platz: “Okay. Okay. So, like, when — if you do take diuretics prior to a show, they're usually natural diuretics and not Aldactone or Dyazide.” Chris Cormier: “I've tried that also. I tried it to where I stopped the use of diuretics on a Wednesday, and I was tested on a Saturday, and it wasn't in my system.  But then between the Wednesday and Saturday, your water — your water intake has to be at all-time low.  I've tried that with taking — the only thing I drank from the Wednesday until Saturday was a diuretic tea.  I've tried that, and it seemed to work pretty well.  I only tried it once, though.  I'm just trying different ways to, you know, get the best — the best results.” Tom Platz: “I guess my question would be, do you think the steroid — diuretic test is real?” Chris Cormier: “I think it's real. I don't want to test, you know, risk losing all my money or — you know, it's not saying because there's not much, you know, discipline behind getting busted for it.  But losing that money is the — that's the biggest thing at this point in time.” Chris Cormier's Scariest Insulin Experience Tom Platz: “As a pro-athlete, I understand. Sure. Anything really scary ever happened to you with diuretic use or GH use or insulin use?” Chris Cormier: “I mean, you feel the effects when you take insulin.  As far as you know, lightheaded, sweating a lot, you just grab on to — the use of some kind of …” [34:00] Quickly touching on “feeling” the effects of insulin. If you feel your insulin, you're not taking it right, just a heads up there. I don't know if that's consistent with every time he took it, but if he was taking 12 to 15 IUs of fast acting Insulin, I would understand why he would be going hypoglycemic fairly often. You shouldn't feel low blood sugar symptoms because you shouldn't be using enough insulin to drop your blood sugar that low to begin with, or you should be eating enough carbs to complement it. And if you get to that point, you're defeating the purpose of the insulin in the first place, which is to drive the nutrients from your current diet into the muscle more efficiently. If you add in carbs around your insulin use you're defeating the purpose of it and working against yourself. With your current diet, however much food you need to grow, your insulin dose should accommodate that amount of carbohydrates, not the other way around where you have some arbitrary dosages of 12 to 15 IUs, and then you're forcing yourself to have to take in an extra 120 to 150 g of carbs to make sure you don't end up with low blood sugar symptoms. That's a huge mistake guys make, they eat around their insulin dose, which is an arbitrary dose to begin with, rather than having their dose based around their diet, which is how a diabetic uses it and how it's intended to be used. You shouldn't ever be going hypoglycemic because you want to feel it. You shouldn't be feeling this at all. Go For Regular Checkups Chris Cormier: “Sugar in the system or whatever.  I've always had that when I got checkups for steroids stuff, I always (INAUDIBLE) you know, great results from that.  It's always been fine.” Tom Platz: “So, you do recommend checkups?”  Chris Cormier: “Yeah, definitely recommend checkups.  Not so much right when you're in a competition phase, because you're taking a lot of different steroids and then the results is going to get back because there's going to be a pretty — a lot of problem, is not going to be normal.  But I have to discard taking anything for say, six to eight weeks or so.  And then go to the doctor, whatever, then I think if everything's back to normal, I think you're doing pretty much the right thing.  Some people would — are getting, you know, some better results as far as their different — the sperm count now and their liver panel results coming back, you're still kind of high.  That's — you know, you need to step — take a look back and see, is this all worth it for you, or are you getting, you know — is the push yourself is really (INAUDIBLE)” View On Steroid Use and Genetics In The 90's Tom Platz: “Is the risk worth the effort? How do you feel about competing in today's arena, on today's stage, you know?” Chris Cormier: “I don't think that the problem I have (INAUDIBLE) when people are acting like it's all about drugs.  And you know, I was — it's — you know, it seem to put a bad taste in your mouth when you see people at this stage is really all like — they brag about how they like to take steroids, how they like to (INAUDIBLE) you know?  Because I'm still one of the guys that like to push hard and train intensely.  And you know, I still want to see exactly what I can do as far as I can push myself to get the development that I was looking for, and you know, from — when I started this whole crusade.” Tom Platz: “Do you ever — do you ever think to yourself that, Geez, I think we're pushing genetics to the ultimate edge that it's getting pretty risky?” Chris Cormier: “Sometimes, yeah.” Tom Platz: “Like when (INAUDIBLE) he has problems and you're like (INAUDIBLE) or Andreas Munzer, does it like make you think go on — take two steps backwards and go, “Wait a minute”? Chris Cormier: “Yeah, definitely. You have to be crazy not to. And you'd think that, oh, it won't happen to me. I think it could happen to anyone.” [38:08] If you don't know who Andreas Munzer is, I highly recommend you go look at his story. He's an example of a guy who basically red lined his body for bodybuilding year-round. The infamous Andreas Munzer death cycle… I don't know if it's legitimate or not. I should do a video on that too. His use was an example of insane levels of abuse, and it ended his life in his 30s. That's what they're referring to right here. Obviously, the goal is to have a long healthy life, while not becoming a bodybuilding statistic. That's what the purpose of these interviews is supposed to be for in the first place, rather than to shed light on what dosages you should be using. They're not trying to promote use, they're trying to shed light on the deaths themselves. I'm surprised that Munzer's passing wasn't brought up earlier. This is the first interview where they brought up notable deaths from a result of abuse. Chris Cormier's Advice For Upcoming Bodybuilders Tom Platz: “Is there any suggestions or any words of wisdom you might give our viewers who were looking at you (INAUDIBLE) that's where I want to be in life?” Chris Cormier: “I think that, first of all, I would suggest, if you really don't have what it takes to be one of those guys, you need to really be honest with yourself and say, “I could appreciate what they're doing, but it is not for me to step, you know, that far into what's dangerous and what's, you know, large (INAUDIBLE) you know, what's good for yourself.  Then, secondly, I suggest if you did, you know, want to compete, and you're not going to go pro and whatever, I wouldn't do anything dangerous, and I wouldn't do — if you plan on taking it, then first I would suggest not to, you know, it's better not to and live longer, and you got to, you know, like, you know, you're going to have a lot easier life all around if you didn't.  But if we did choose to, then I would suggest taking a little as possible to get some results that you're looking for like I said.” Tom Platz: “So, you think the steroids and the GH and the insulin and other agents can limit your life and put more stress in your body?” Chris Cormier: “I would say so.” Bodybuilding's Chemical Warfare Tom Platz: “Okay, I mean, I'm just going to understand, of course, and I've been where you are.  I've retired some time ago, but I'm watching it — our sport progress.  And you know, I don't — it's no — it seems to have gotten to the point now, where it's maybe — I don't — you should answer this rather than me, but is it chemical warfare now?” Chris Cormier: “In some ways, yeah. I would — I would say yeah. I mean, when you're on out there away from home and you've taken different things, you know, I've been places and get a lot of bloody noses and things of that nature.  You know, you start to, Oh my god, what's going on?  Or, you know, (INAUDIBLE) stuck here — and stuck in this period (INAUDIBLE)” [41:22] If you have a bloody nose while you're running steroids I can almost guarantee it's blood pressure related. Check your blood pressure. High blood pressure is probably the number one easily preventable health risk in bodybuilding that ends up hurting a lot of guys down the road. It goes completely overlooked quite often because guys will just walk around with chronic stage 1 or even stage 2 hypertension for years and not even realize it. One of my best friends at age 21 had a pulmonary embolism from having a blood clot in his calf that traveled up to his brain. He had no idea it was there because he was walking around with chronically high blood pressure. I'm not sure if he was on steroids at the time, but it was 100% preventable. You don't want something like that to happen to you. Keep an eye on your blood pressure. It's a super easy thing to maintain to just by getting in your magnesium, your potassium, your sodium, your water, having a proper diet, avoiding excessively aromatizing compounds, keeping an eye on your blood pressure, and just not being stupid. Tom Platz: “On an annual basis, say, if like…” [42:36] When I was younger, I remember literally walking inside the University or sitting in a class, and I would just randomly get nosebleeds because my blood pressure was so high from the Dianabol I was on. I would get a nosebleed in the squat rack too when I was doing my sets. Even when I was a bouncer downtown, I remember there were a couple of times that I'd have to go to the bathroom in the middle of my shift because my nose would start bleeding while I was standing at the front door. Don't put yourself in that situation. Chris Cormier's Yearly Steroid Expense Tom Platz: “If we look at the last few years back, understanding that the growth hormone and expense of that I think you mentioned up to 9 cc's …” Chris Cormier: “9 IUs, yeah.” Tom Platz: “9 IUs, I'm sorry. You can tell growth wasn't around when I was competing.  At least it was around when I bought a new car instead. What's the annual expenditure approximately on getting ready for an event?” [43:38] It's interesting, Tom Platz just said it was around in his era, and his era is the 80's. A lot of people think that no one used growth hormone in the 80's, and it was a practice introduced in the 90's. Tom Platz: “A rough number on that.” Chris Cormier: “Close around $5,000 to — some people may go up to $10,000 or so … At least $5,000.  Tom Platz: “That's even with the growth hormone being involved in, you know …” Chris Cormier: “That's at a minimum, yeah.” Tom Platz: “So, you say, $5,000, $10,000 minimum? So, it can go as high as …” Chris Cormier: “Depends on the person, you know?” Tom Platz: “I have heard up to $100,000” Chris Cormier: “It can go up. I've put — some of the things I've done, I've done with $5,000 in that area. That's all the drug use (INAUDIBLE) it depend on what kind of deals you're getting, and, you know …” Tom Platz: “… what's available, and of course, how much the price of it, and …” Chris Cormier: “Yes. Because as I said, you know, I don't think — and that's not even a big number for what I'm doing.  That's whatever I achieved on that money for stuff is — I think is pretty good.” The Open Use Of Drugs Through Doctors Tom Platz: “And you've — do you think it would be healthier if it was not classified as a class 3 drug and it was a (INAUDIBLE) through doctor or medical intervention?” Chris Cormier: “Definitely. In other countries, you — that's available like that, have doctors and people that work closely with you.  Because it's going to — people are going to do it anyway, they're going to do it no matter what the cause, no matter what the kind of trouble you can get into. It's going to happen and you see it every day.” [45:40] I 100% agree with that. Chris Cormier: “It's also in the bodybuilding but it's also (INAUDIBLE) on football and track and you know, things that — sports like that.  Gymnastics, they're getting all of the time; swimming, and all that stuff. Tom Platz: “I think it's worse now than it's ever been in all sports.” Chris Cormier: “Definitely. There's junior high school kids just taking pills and doing whatever.  It's pretty — it's amazing.” Chris Cormier's Take On How Old A Person Should Be To Take Steroids Tom Platz: “And how old do you think a person should be before considering a possible steroid program?  We're not making recommendations here, of course. We're not pro-steroids, we're merely talking about reality, but …” Chris Cormier: “I would suggest educating yourself on as many as long as you can stand it.  And wait as long as you can.” You know, if you can be in your mid-20's, or upper 20's and that would be a lot better than, you know, starting off, you know, early teens or whatever.” [46:37] I mostly agree with that. I did a video and article on this recently too, about when a responsible time to start using would be, if your use was inevitable. It's not about when, as I'm not trying to say you should start. The entire point of the article was to state that if you're dead set on doing it, regardless of what people advise, then take these precautions into consideration. Basically, the chances of you, having the knowledge to, first of all, even implement pharmacology in a safe and effective manner, where you're probably not just wasting it, or at least the majority of it, is very unlikely at a young age, regardless of how much research you think you've done. I promise you, it takes years to understand this stuff thoroughly, as well as diet and training. The diet and training part itself takes a couple of years, at least, to really come into your own and understand. It's not just about you hitting your macros, it's not just about getting enough protein in, it goes far beyond that. The pharmacology is a whole new ballgame. Even once you get into that and you think you know everything, you'll learned a million new things over the next 5 to 10 years. I'm still learning to this day. I don't even think my knowledge was thorough enough when I started, and I wish I waited until a lot later to get into performance enhancement. I advise you to check out this article, “My Number 1 Piece Of Advice If You Are Going To Use Steroids.” Chris Cormier On Roid Rage Tom Platz: “I understand you do have health concerns and makes total sense that you would have health concerns and the look at the risk versus the benefit.  And this is your chosen profession, and you pursue it along those lines.  I think every athlete I speak with feels the same way.  And I hear that coming from you, a concern, but yet, not to commit suicide.  You got to do it as strategically and as healthy as possible in order to compete in that arena. This stuff that we read about in the magazines called roid rage, does that really exist in your opinion?” Chris Cormier: “I think it exists. But (INAUDIBLE) individuals that are — that are (INAUDIBLE) temper, and it's just heightened it.  I think some of you have learned how to control that — it is an aggressive drug, it can make you really aggressive, you're really aggressive.  And as you're going to be, you know, standard at risk in getting really upset and not being able to control yourself.  I remember the first two years I was taken at it.  And I had to go, Wait a minute (INAUDIBLE)  A little bit more excited and, you know, it's just little — just someone crossing the street, you know, but it's — Yeah, I think — I think it's real.  But I think people label a lot of people have roid rage, when is that really roid rage? I mean, you don't have to be on a cycle to get really mad.” [49:51] It definitely just exacerbates your current state and the kind of a person you are in my opinion. I don't think it's going to make some really chill, mellow dude a psycho at all. I think it's going to make a guy who's a psycho more of a psycho though for sure. Chris Cormier: “People prove that every day in the news.” Tom Platz: “Do you think it enhances your natural aggressiveness.” Chris Cormier: “Definitely.” Tom Platz: “Or your natural personality to some degree?”  Chris Cormier: “Definitely.” Masking Agents Use Tom Platz: “One of the things that I also want to discuss tonight would be masking agents of any kinds.  I mean, granted that you were able to get around the diuretic test based upon, you know, limiting your — time you're on certain diuretics and taking other (INAUDIBLE).  Are there any masking agents that you ever utilized that were a benefit?” [50:38] I'm not sure why this is such a prominent question. I don't think there's anything that's going to trick a test into thinking there's nothing in your system if the test was a legitimate test to begin with. For example, how could you take a Lasix and then pop another pill and have it trick a test into not thinking there's Lasix in your system? I don't know, it seems like an odd question. Chris Cormier: “No. Yeah, you hear about things, this and that, but I'm not one to try to take a chance on some (INAUDIBLE)” Tom Platz: “How about things like Esiclene, where you inject into the muscle itself to temporarily (INAUDIBLE) the tissue, and is that of any benefit in your protocol?” Chris Cormier: “Yes, that's definitely another benefit that people can, you know, probably put you up another spot or two if you — if you had Esiclene and you had the right — be in the right places and, you know —  But a lot of people are abusing different effect — different substances like that.  And it's just don't (INAUDIBLE) it's not what we started out to do.  If that was the case, then why try to train your calves when you could just be sticking yourself with all kinds of different things.  And you know, I'm just — like I said, I still like to see what I can do myself.” Chris Cormier's Take On A Complete Steroid Ban In Competitions Tom Platz: “It makes me — when you said that, “still like to see what I could do myself,” if there was a test where nobody could take anything, otherwise, they'd be bust immediately.  If there was a really, you know, test that would create a fair playing field, and if drugs were completely eradicated, would you be in favor of that?” Chris Cormier: “Oh, yeah.  Yeah, let's see what — let's see what we all can do. Yeah, definitely.” Tom Platz: “I've often — and I've often thought about that.  And if we could really have this test where no one could really pass the test and use any kind of drugs.  Guys like yourself that, you know, they're doing real well, they're competing in all the top shows, and placing real high, and it's like — it's like — you know, it's like, it's getting old.” Chris Cormier: “Oh, yeah, I would love — I'd love that.” Tom Platz: “It's what I hear and that's sort of the way I feel, but I'm not going to …” Chris Cormier: “But it's just — you know, like I said, if (INAUDIBLE) by the rules and everyone's gonna do, you know, exactly what, you know, just — yeah, that would be great.” Androstene Use Tom Platz: “Just an interesting point that you brought — you brought up that I sort of thought about for a second.  Besides the, you know, the drugs like the steroids and the GHs and the insulin and the diuretics, are there any other like Androstene, is there anything like that you've utilized that would you feel is definitely worthy of calling it steroid-like substance?” Chris Cormier: “I think Androstene is good. I have tested myself and only used an Androstene for a period of time. Training totally without steroids and still pushed some pretty good weight.” Tom Platz: “Do you ever use in conjunction with steroids?” Chris Cormier: “No.” Tom Platz: “It's usually in the offseason.” Chris Cormier: “No, never. If I were going to use Androstene, I use it by itself.” Post-Cycle Therapy (PCT) Tom Platz: “In the offseason after you've done taken been taking steroids, you know, during pre-season and the contest is over, are there any agents you use to bring your testosterone back to natural levels, or HCG or …” Chris Cormier: “Yeah, I use HCG or the Clomid. I use those two …” Tom Platz: “Together?”  Chris Cormier: “I used them together before.  And I use, you know, pretty good amounts of HCG.  It's good, you know, if you can get a hold of whatever (INAUDIBLE) then I just — I just relax for a while and just take time off.” Tom Platz: “Just let it go back naturally?”  Chris Cormier: “Yeah, uh-huh.” Tom Platz: “Some of the amounts of Clomid or HCG, any idea dosages do you recall?” Chris Cormier: “Umm… Usually 10,000 IUs of the HCG and I'd take that a couple of times per week.” [54:54] I thought he was going to completely forget about the dosages because he doesn't actually PCT, but maybe he does. Tom Platz: “And Clomid would be like tablet wise?” Chris Cormier: “Yeah. I don't remember the milligrams on those, but I would take that every day for about a week or so. Maybe like three to four tabs a day.” [55:20] So that would probably be anywhere from 100 to 200 mg of Clomid if he's taking that many tabs per day. Chris Cormier's Take On Nolvadex Tom Platz: “Do you think Nolvadex is useful occasionally?”  Chris Cormier: “Yeah. But I guess recently (INAUDIBLE) started to believe that it's — pretty toxic to your liver. And you know, it's not exactly what people thought it was at first, so … And also, it has some way of fighting against your natural growth hormone levels.” [55:47] That's the same thing that Ronnie Coleman was talking about in the interview he did. Obviously, these bodybuilders must talk and share theories with each other because that was the exact same thing Ronnie was talking about, how Nolvadex hinders IGF-1. Tom Platz: “Yeah, I've heard that stated by a number of guys. Yeah.” Chris Cormier: “Some people started shying away from Nolvadex. I'm one of them.” Teslac Use Tom Platz: “Is there anything — other blocking agent, like, that you would consider replacing Nolvadex?” Chris Cormier: “There is — it's slipping my mind right now.” Tom Platz: “Proviron?” Chris Cormier: “There was another one. It's a 50 mg drug.” Tom Platz: “Oh, the T …” Chris Cormier: “Teslac. Teslac.” Tom Platz: “You think that's a worthy substance?” Chris Cormier: “It's really good.” Tom Platz: “And how long would you take that, a short duration?” Chris Cormier: “Yeah, for the duration of the cycle. For the whole cycle, I would take that.” Tom Platz: “All during the cycle?” I see. I see. So if you're …” Chris Cormier: “50 mg on up to 200 mg, which was in the course of the competition.” Tom Platz: “And then do you just stop? Or, do you get off slowly?” Chris Cormier: “I would get off slowly. And then I would just stop everything then.” Tom Platz: “So, it's a 15-week cycle or something like that?” Chris Cormier: “If you can get that much, yeah.” Tom Platz: “Yeah. That might be something …” Chris Cormier: “If you can only get one bottle this time then, you know, you deal with that.” Chris Cormier's Scariest Injection Experience Tom Platz: “You deal with that. I understand. I understand. Did anything scary ever happened to you that gave you an ill effect or even a look that wasn't …” Chris Cormier: “Yeah, one time I ended up — I tried to inject it to my calves to see what happen if …” [58:00] Calves are one of the most nerve dense areas. I'm telling you, do not pin your calves. Chris Cormier: “You know, for looking, you know (INAUDIBLE) but I injected into it until it was really painful (INAUDIBLE) and it was …” [58:18] Even if you get it perfect, it's still going to cripple you probably just from the pain. Tom Platz: “What was it you injected that …” Chris Cormier: “It was a regular testosterone.  It wasn't even like a Equipoise.  I mean, not like a small in size type thing. But people nowadays, they'll shoot it like all over the body, from biceps to triceps to — I think you (INAUDIBLE) want to do because you know — you don't know what's under you, like, you know, you're shooting in the dark, you know?  And it's really dangerous, you can hit some nerves or create some damage, you have no idea what you're going to do, you know?  But you know, I put some on my calves — I don't know if the muscle is atrophied a little (INAUDIBLE) right there.  So, like the muscle is not really there anymore. So, it was enough for me right there.  I don't do anything like that anymore.” Tom Platz: “Some kind of tissue damage.” Chris Cormier: “Yeah, tissue damage.” [59:18] It might have been nerve damage. Now, he can't get proper circulation there. I don't know, but it's a good reason why you shouldn't pin your calves. Not that I feel many people do, but still, I know some people who have tried doing Synthol protocols in their calves. They've had to get anatomy charts that show where the nerves run down their calves to make sure they pin in spots that aren't going to hit their nerves. It seems way too intense for me, and I feel for most people. Chris Cormier: “It's not — I don't know. It's not what it's meant to do.” Chris Cormier's Caloric Intake Tom Platz: “If we float in now to just discuss food, okay, it's the easy stuff now. I mean, how many calories do you eat a day? Chris Cormier: “Well, that varies also. And I'm not a really big eater, but it would be — I've had 4,000 something calorie diets at times.” [1:00:20] It sounds like to him, 4,000 is a lot. That just goes to show again, a top Olympia caliber competitor doesn't need to eat 10,000 calories to grow, just like you don't need to. At the end of the day, if you're in a surplus, you're going to gain muscle and some fat. The more you overspill past that surplus of just unnecessarily cranking your calories up, you're just gaining more fat and not gaining more muscle. Don't overeat because you saw a diet in a magazine that says Jay Cutler eats 10,000 calories because it's probably not the case. Tom Platz: “For a contest, do you eat something closer to (INAUDIBLE) calories, total calories?” Chris Cormier: “It's when I eat more in contest or pre-contest.” Tom Platz: “More for on? (INAUDIBLE) can you eat anything you want?  I mean, do you eat ice cream, cake, cookies, candy, all kinds of stuff and get in shape?” Chris Cormier: “I think I'll eat a cookie or so”  Tom Platz: “So, you can eat more.” Chris Cormier: “I can eat more cookies per week, yeah. And a couple of days or sometimes every day I can have a cookie.” Tom Platz: “Okay. So, you eat more junk food, if you will, just to keep you from filling weight.” Chris Cormier: “Just to keep your sanity, yeah.” Protein, Carbohydrate, Fat Macronutrient Ratios Tom Platz: “In regards to like a normal offseason versus on season now.  The calories may change but as far as ratios of protein, carbohydrates, and fats, do you record those things?” Chris Cormier: “I've done it before, yes.  Lately, I've been gone by what I see in the mirror. You know, if I'm — I wake up (INAUDIBLE) the day before, I know I'll repeat what I'm doing.  And if I need to make change, then I would raise or lower my carbohydrates, or raise or lower my proteins.” Tom Platz: “In terms of grams, any idea how many grams of protein you consume a day offseason versus on season?” Chris Cormier: “It can go up to like between 300 to 500. I may …” [1:02:26] So many guys think everyone is eating too much protein, and you only need to have 0.6-0.8 grams per pound bodyweight, and one gram per pound is more than enough. When you're discussing this topic in the context of professional bodybuilders using exogenous androgens with increased levels of protein synthesis and 260-plus pound lean physiques, studies on untrained skinny dudes are out the window at that point. We're not talking about your natural guy and his ability to synthesize 30 grams per meal, or whatever the science is saying. We're talking about Olympia bodybuilders here, and they're eating on average 300 to 500 grams of protein per day based on what I've heard in these interviews. It seems pretty consistent. It's funny because I always see comments in the comments section that are trying to critique the bodybuilders and say they're eating too much protein and they're stupid. Well, dude, maybe that's what it takes at that level. They're not 170-pound guys here trying to get to 5% body fat at 155. It's a bit of a different context, and applying the protein studies to these kind of guys is out the window in my opinion. Tom Platz: “300, 500 grams of protein?” Chris Cormier: “Right, of protein.” Tom Platz: “Okay, and then in the season? In the season and then also in …” Chris Cormier: “Offseason is probably low as more carbohydrates in the offseason.” Tom Platz: “I see.” Chris Cormier: “Than anything, and then …” Tom Platz: “So, the carbohydrates actually go lower in season?” Chris Cormier: “Right. Pretty low.” Tom Platz: “So, they would be like gram-wise …” [1:03:51] That's pretty consistent I feel like, where offseason, if you're trying to build muscle, you would increase your carbohydrate intake, lower your protein to accommodate that increase of carbs, carbs are protein-sparing, people know that. And then, as you get deeper into a contest prep phase, you start to slowly lower your carbohydrates and increase your protein to retain tissue. That's pretty consistent with what I've seen over the years. Chris Cormier: “I'm not exactly sure gram-wise.”  Tom Platz: “Approximately.” Chris Cormier: “It's really a few cups of rice in the morning, and then in the evening, a couple potatoes or something like that, but between there, it's just all protein and then …” Tom Platz: “Is that like eight weeks out?”  Chris Cormier: “… and vegetables from — yeah, 8 weeks, yeah.” Tom Platz: “Okay. And then fat, probably gram-wise.” Chris Cormier: “Fat — (INAUDIBLE)” Tom Platz: “Do you eat steak?” Chris Cormier: “I would — I would — I'll eat steaks and also like avocados and, you know, something like MCT oils, stuff like that.” Tom Platz: “So, fats more moderate as you …” [1:04:58] MCT oil is the oil that is typically in Synthol, by the way. It's funny when people talk poorly about Synthol or talk about this wonder drug “Synthol” and how sketchy it is, and in the end, it's literally just sterile MCT oil. Chris Cormier: “Yeah, exactly. High protein, moderate fat, some low to medium carbohydrates.” Always Count Your Macros, Micros, and Calories Tom Platz: “The way what I hear from you, you used to count earlier on, and when you're already (INAUDIBLE) now you go by instinct and feel and pretty much know.  Interesting, sounds like being an artist to some degree, isn't it, sort of?” Chris Cormier: “Yeah. You know, after a while, you can sort of, you know, manipulate what your body is going to do despite what you eat the day before. And, you know, those two days and trying to see a change.” [1:05:55] Something I recommend to you guys, especially if it's your first couple of years, meticulously count macros, micros, and just overall calories, and learn how your body works inside out. And then, eventually, you get to a point like this guy here, where he can just eyeball his food and know exactly how his body is going to respond. I can look at a piece of chicken right now without even weighing it, and can probably tell you the amount of calories, give or take 20 calories, how many calories it's going to be, how many grams of protein it's going to be, how much fat is in it, etc. Eventually, you're going to learn your body inside out. That's also my number one tip when it comes to dieting. If you're just starting out, don't think that you can just eyeball stuff and figure it out because that's how you're either: A), never going to get shredded; or B), not grow sufficiently; or C), get fat as hell. Tom Platz On Educating Aspiring Bodybuilders Tom Platz: “The sport of bodybuilding is my neighborhood we come from, and I would never want to do anything to really, you know, damage or expose dirty laundry.  You know, my goal here is not to expose dirty laundry of our sport or anybody else's sport from this video, but merely to use as an educational source of material to where the up and coming guy can go, here is the way it really is.  Here's somebody that's on top, and in fact, this guy's on top, you don't know who he is but he is on top okay. And he's telling the way he really sees it, the way he really feels about it, and he does have concerns about his health.  And, like all the guys I spoke to, they have concerns about their health, and they're looking at it as a benefit to risk ratio, and what's necessary to do to compete in today's arena.  Some felt that they needed to — it was getting too far out of hand, like with yourself, it's too far out of hand, and it's getting crazy, and …  But a lot of — most of the top guys seem to have a control.  They're like not nuts, there's people — as much as the amateurs are who are viewing the pros going “more is better,” it's, in fact, you know, “more is better to point,” as I'm hearing it most of the day.  But it's like I'm seeing it — there's a little — there's a centeredness and there's a regime and a focus and a controlled method of approaching the drugs.  And you're concerned with health, and the risk episode you may have run into, you consider don't want to have that happen again.  So, you seek the advice about drug testing and doctors and so on, which is interesting, I think, for the fans to hear — I mean, the up and coming guys to hear that.  This not just take everything and get your hands on, and hope for the best, you know?” Chris Cormier: “Right.” Tom Platz: “But again, I — the reason we're doing this foremost — I'm speaking to the audience at this point.  The reason we're doing this is not to expose anyone, not to expose dirty laundry of any sport, especially sport that we all come from, but merely serve as an educational tool and hopes that they'll be less abusive procedures.  Maybe less use to point towards a healthier, cleaner approach to sport, in general.  And I'm just to the point now where I don't want to see any more of my friends' lives in (INAUDIBLE) mostly amateurs, friends' lives endangered.  And it's — I really am — some of — some of you may disagree, but I'm very happy and pleased to address the issues in terms of honesty.  I think we should do more of that, rather than just avoiding the issue and talking about the issue as if it doesn't exist.  It does exist in the various men you hear — you heard spoke today on this tape.  I commend and I thank you very much for providing this insight into the reality of the sport and hopefully, we can make a difference.  And we have made a difference in the way you see things.  Thank you very much for being here.  Appreciate it.” Conclusion On Tom Platz's Backstage Secret Of The Pros [1:09:47] That pretty much wraps up this series. Hopefully, you guys found that as interesting as I did, as insightful, and just enlightening in general. It really puts things in perspective and can also check a lot of egos, too. A lot of guys think the secret is “more is better,” and “my next cycle is going to be the one that blows me up,” and then, “I'm going to get a pro card, I'm going to be at the Olympia.” If you can't get your pro card off of what these guys are taking, it's probably not in the cards for you. At least with basketball and soccer and stuff, you can play recreationally and enjoy it, but with bodybuilding, it's tough to just say you should sauce your face off because if you're not going to be competing at a high level, there's no benefit to weighing 260 year-round. Let's put things in perspective guys, and don't kill yourself trying to get these superhero physiques. If it's not in the cards for you, don't push your body past what it can handle. I know there's going to be a lot of people that think these guys are lying because they want to underplay their use and not seem like they use very much. Frankly, I actually believe them, and I just think they're genetic anomalies who probably have Myostatin mutations, sensitive androgen receptors, and hyper-response to training and drugs in general. The genetics these top guys have would be impossible for you or I to replicate no matter how much drugs you use (unless you happen to be a genetic anomaly too). There are certain things in your genetic code that you just can't make up for. If your body produces a bunch of Myostatin in response to androgens, and another guy doesn't, there's absolutely nothing you can do until new developments in drug pharmacology come out.

    "content": "When Bodybuilders Retire… | Before And After Pictures     Videos are posted to YouTube all the time highlighting the shocking regression bodybuilders physiques undergo after they retire from competing. Rather than focus on the deterioration of their physiques, I prefer to look at the situation in a more positive light. The fact is, many bodybuilders retire not out of choice, but rather because they are presented with an ultimatum where they realize that if they continue down the road they're on they will likely end up dead much sooner than they would like.  I want to pay homage to bodybuilders of the past that have significantly downsized, and improved their health status as a result. The problem with being a massive 300 lbs lean bodybuilder is that it's extremely stressful on the organs. Mostly the cardiovascular system. I'm sure you're well aware of that. I've discussed this in many articles and videos in the past. The fact is, it's not sustainable to walk around at 260-300 lbs lean for years and years. Perhaps it's something that you can get away with sporadically throughout a bodybuilding stint to compete at a high level, but long-term, even potentially short-term, it's not sustainable. Think about it, you're almost never going to see a guy live past his 50's who's maintaining a 300 lbs lean physique. Most of these guys are going to have severe cardiovascular issues occurring before that in their 40s, or perhaps even younger in some cases. Instead of highlighting how much these bodybuilders who downsized have lost, what I want to highlight is how much they've gained out of the mental strength and fortitude it takes to downsize.  The Mental Strength And Fortitude It Takes To Downsize The problem with bodybuilding is that it's extremely addicting. If I was to ask you if you were willing to lose 30 pounds of muscle to gain 20 years on your life, what would you say? Many would actually think hard about that, and some wouldn't even consider it. There are many bodybuilders who have spent years packing on exorbitant amounts of muscle. Typically, the guys that are the most addicted to bodybuilding are the ones that have managed to build these impressive massive physiques that you see on stage.  You can just imagine the amount of years, drugs, food, and hard training that it took them to build these physiques. Now, imagine putting yourself in their position where you've put in years of work building up this insane physique only to know that down the line, you're going to have to literally willpower your way through dropping 100 lbs of that muscle you've built to have a long, healthy life after that. That's an unimaginable obstacle to even think about. These guys have to literally consider dropping their life's work to get back to a healthy state.  The sad reality is you can't walk around at 300 lbs forever. Even in the short-term, you probably can't do it for more than maybe 10-20 years at most without putting yourself at massive risk. Constant drug use + constant excessive eating + walking around with nearly 300 pounds of lean muscle = massive stress on the organs The mental fortitude it would take to watch all of your hard work just go down the drain in order to be healthy is something I can't even imagine having to take on.  Your pride, joy, and your livelihood are based on the physique that you've built over years of grueling blood, sweat, and tears in the gym. And then you have to intentionally watch it disappear in order to become healthy. When Bodybuilders Put Health And Wellness Over Bodybuilding I give all the credit in the world to guys like Paul Dillet or guys like Dorian Yates.   These guys have literally gone from insane freak physiques to looking like your average guy. They obviously completely dedicated their lives to the process of building muscle. Why else would they be bodybuilding if they didn't love the process. These guys are known for their physiques, and their entire identity has been built around it. To intentionally downsize to such a degree, where people barely recognize you and your physique in comparison to what they expect you to look like, it must have been extremely difficult. I think it's a really commendable, as that is something a lot of people wouldn't be able to do, or even come to terms with. Most gym rats who've spent years building massive amounts of muscle can't mentally wrap their head around losing that muscle, which ultimately leads many to preventable heart attacks, strokes, and kidney failure in men as young as 40 – 50 years old. You have guys like Paul Dillet, Dorian Yates, Shawn Ray, Dave Palumbo, Mike Morris, and plenty of other pros who've actually managed to get back down to a more sustainable weight after seeing the writing on the wall when bodybuilders first started dropping like flies in the 90's. They've been able to mentally deal with the unfathomable task of watching all their hard work wash away.  There are a lot of guys from the 80's and 90's who are good examples and are health-conscious individuals. They didn't let it completely consume their minds to a point that it ended their lives prematurely. I just wanted to pay homage to those guys in this article, and use it as a wake-up call. Chasing And Maintaining Mass Monster Stats Is Not A Sustainable Practice The risk-profile of a mass monster is already obscenely high while competing, and many of those bodybuilders are forced into retirement because of health complications, or have died as a result of not heeding the red flags.  It's seemingly more prevalent than ever nowadays.  Partially because of social media, but also because the bodybuilding industry still rewards massive unhealthy physiques and has created a fraudulent industry founded upon a “healthy lifestyle” with their posterboys being some of the most unhealthy humans on the planet.  Many bodybuilders let bodybuilding consume their life to the point of trying to maintain their mass monster status for long durations of time. Even past their prime of competing, these guys tried to maintain massive physiques for years on end. Guys like Nasser and Rich Piana are guys that could have averted, or significantly delayed their premature deaths if they had just mentally accepted that it's not a sustainable practice to maintain mass monster status for decades.   I think a lot of guys need to take note of the commendable cases like the Dorian Yates and the Paul Dillets of the world who have shown that even in the most extreme scenarios, it's possible to really let this addiction go and get healthy again after completing your bodybuilding goals, or whatever you've set out to accomplish by building a physique. And I give all the credit in the world to these guys. To be clear, it is NOT healthy to let yourself go and get out of shape (obviously). This article is meant to address the organ stress excessive amounts of drugs and supraphysiological muscle mass can cause, and the commendable will power it would take to not sauce yourself into the ground trying to maintain absurd amounts of mass for decades.

    "date": "2019-08-15T00:08:02+00:00",
    "content": "Should You Weigh Your Meat Cooked Or Uncooked? | HUGE Macros Mistake     Weigh your meat raw, and then weigh that same amount cooked so you know exactly how much it is being dehydrated during the cooking process. A big mistake I see people make all the time when calculating their macros is they weigh their meat cooked without factoring in the uncooked weight. This is a pound of raw ground bison. I will use this as an example of what I'm referring to exactly.   Weight Of Uncooked Meat Vs. Cooked Meat Uncooked, this pack of Bison is exactly 16 ounces. I'll show you what a pound of uncooked ground bison actually weighs after it's been cooked and some of the moisture is sucked out of it and it's ready to eat. After weighing the cooked ground bison, you can see it's only 10.6 ounces (a piece spilled on the counter, hence why the scale shows 10.3 ounces).  After cooking a pound of 90/10 ground bison, it dehydrates down 5.4 ounces, which is obviously a significant amount and could easily lead to greatly underestimated macros. If you're cooking your meat and then you're putting it on a scale to measure it, I strongly advise that you get the pre-cooked weight first and then you compare it to the cooked weight to make sure you don't have inaccurate macros. On the back of the ground bison package, you can see that it has 4 servings of 4 ounces of raw meat (16 ounces total, or 1 pound).  If you're eating all of it, that would be 760 calories. But when it's cooked, it gets dehydrated down to only 10.6 ounces. That 10.6 ounces of cooked meat equates to that same 760 calories. If you weighed out 16 ounces cooked, you'd actually end up accidentally eating 1,147 calories without even realizing it. HUGE Macros Mistake | Weigh Your Meat Uncooked, And Then Compare That To The Cooked Weight I'm assuming most of you guys are probably cooking more than one day's worth at a time, just like I usually do. If you throw 4 lbs of red meat into your pan to cook it, it will end up weighing much less after it is ready to eat than it was raw. Also, many people don't get their meat pre-packaged in convenient 1 pound increments. They just buy a big log of lean ground beef, and they'll throw it in the pan and cook it all up. Once cooked, they'll put it in a container, and they'll measure the meat each day as they eat it. As a result, each day when they're portioning their meals they are severely underestimating what they are consuming as they are measuring the cooked weight and completely forgetting that the raw weight was much heavier than the current cooked weight. If I wanted to eat half of a pound of ground bison for example, I would weigh out the raw weight (if I didn't already have 1 pound packages), and then compare it to the cooked weight, and then using that formula moving forward I would know that each half pound of ground bison is actually only 5.3 ounces after it has been cooked. In other words, the macros of 5.3 ounces of cooked ground bison = the macros of 8 ounces of raw uncooked ground bison. For example, they want a half-pound of ground bison, they'll put in eight ounces on the thing, but in reality, it's only 5.3 ounces when it's cooked. Don't make this common mistake, as there are a lot of people overeating without even realizing it.

    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/does-cardarine-cause-cancer/",
    "date": "2019-08-13T20:01:02+00:00",
    "content": "Does Cardarine Cause Cancer? | The Human Equivalent Dose     This is something I skimmed over in my initial article on Cardarine. I wanted write a dedicated article on this topic as I believe the human equivalent Cardarine dose that caused cancer growth is often calculated incorrectly. Many people think the dosage is some exorbitant amount and they use that to justify their use thinking the human equivalent dosage that caused cancer in rats was thousands of milligrams, when in reality, it really wasn't. With that being said, I don't necessarily think that it's inherently carcinogenic at all. I just want to clarify the data for you in an easy to understand way, show how to calculate the human equivalent dose, and then let you make your own conclusions about it from there.   Table of Contents ToggleHow The Cardarine Cancer Data Is FlawedThe Life Expectancy Of Han Wistar RatsThe Dosages Used In The Cardarine Preclinical Rodent ModelThe Average Weight Of Han Wistar RatsHow To Calculate A Human Equivalent DoseHuman Equivalent Dose Of Cardarine That Led To Cancer Cell ProliferationHas Any Human Developed Cancer Directly As A Result Of Cardarine Use?So… Does Cardarine Cause Cancer?Related How The Cardarine Cancer Data Is Flawed At the 48th Annual Meeting of the Society of Toxicology in 2009 (2 years after Cardarine's abandonment), data was presented showing that Cardarine caused cancer to develop rapidly in several organs in animal testing [R].  As I mentioned in my first Cardarine article in 2016, the first thing to note is the fact that the aforementioned study involved in administering Cardarine to Han Wistar rats for almost two years straight.   The Life Expectancy Of Han Wistar Rats Without being administered any chemicals at all, the median life expectancy of Han Wistar rats is between 30 to 33 months for females and 33 to 36 months for males. The reason for their short life expectancy is the number of adenocarcinomas that they develop [R].  Before we even look at the animal models, you already know that the rats are not expected to live more than three years, irrespective of what they're administered, because of their very high probability of developing cancer. For obvious reasons, I feel like that in itself makes the data pretty unreliable, but let's continue. The Dosages Used In The Cardarine Preclinical Rodent Model The dosages administered to rats over the two-year study varied widely, but the lowest dosage showing cancer cell proliferation in the rodent model was 3 mg/kg/day in Han Wistar rats for a period of 104 weeks [R]. The Average Weight Of Han Wistar Rats The average weight of a Han Wistar rat is 509 grams, or 0.509 kg [R].  How To Calculate A Human Equivalent Dose The following equation is used to calculate roughly what that dosage would equate to in humans: HED (mg / kg = Animal NOAEL mg/kg) × (Weightanimal [kg]/Weighthuman [kg])(1–0.67) [R].  Human Equivalent Dose Of Cardarine That Led To Cancer Cell Proliferation I'll use an 80 kg man as an example to calculate this dosage. This will give you a fairly average reference point of what the human equivalent dose would be in this context. Assuming we have an 80 kg man that we are using for this calculation, we get the following result: Human Equivalent Dose = (3) × (0.509/80)(1–0.67) Human Equivalent Dose = (3) x (0.0063625)(0.33) Human Equivalent Dose = 3 x 0.18845044723 The human equivalent dose, once you break down the calculation comes out to 0.5653513417 mg/kg. Once you multiply that and factor in the bodyweight of an 80 kg human male, you get 45.2281073363 mg.  Frankly, that is not far off from the minimum human equivalent dosage to yield accelerated cancer development in the aforementioned rodent model. Does that mean people who are using Cardarine are going to develop cancer? Not necessarily, because frankly, I feel like using a rat as your reference point that is very likely to get cancer anyway is a pretty poor proxy for what will happen in humans. These rats were administered high doses of Cardarine for over 2/3 of their lifespan. They are also already extremely prone to cancer without even being administered anything. Has Any Human Developed Cancer Directly As A Result Of Cardarine Use? Recreationally, the standard dosage of Cardarine used is between 10 to 20 mg per day. In all of the clinical studies conducted on humans using dosages as high as 10 mg per day for 12 weeks, no serious adverse effects or cancer development was reported [R, R, R]. Even those who use Cardarine recreationally at 20 mg per day typically don't exceed a couple months of use at a time, and they certainly don't use it for 2/3 of their lifespan without breaks. Too much of anything is going to be bad. Stand in front of your microwave or outside in the sun for 2/3 of your life and see what happens (don't actually do that). You can see what I'm getting at though. Chronic exposure to something potentially carcinogenic will certainly have deleterious outcomes. Has any human developed cancer from Cardarine? Not that I'm aware of. But how could you quantify that exactly? It's tough to say because cancer could be attributed to a million other things in somebody's lifestyle and Cardarine could go completely overlooked. Anecdotally, Cardarine has been shown to be generally well-tolerated and there are studies that show it has anti-cancer properties as well [R]. As of now, there is zero evidence to support that Cardarine use at the dosages and duration of exposure used in human trials will cause cancer. However, it is certainly still possible. So… Does Cardarine Cause Cancer? Your own risk profile at the end of the day is up to you. The clinical studies conducted on humans using Cardarine for up to 3 months at 10 mg per day did not report any cancer. Does that mean that any of those participants didn't have some cancer cell proliferation that led to cancer down the line? I have no idea. Frankly, I'm guessing there are at least 5-10 things in your house that are a higher cancer risk than short-term acute use of Cardarine, but that is just my guess at the end of the day. I have yet to see any evidence of its use in humans accelerating cancer cell growth. For lipid modulation, I have used it at 10 mg per day. Would I go higher than that? No, I would not to be honest. Even at 10 mg per day with very short-term use the cancer data is still worrisome. This is why I would reserve it exclusively for addressing a poor lipid profile that is an immediate health concern and cannot be resolved via other lower risk methods of intervention.

Granted, this is supposed to be an anonymous interview. This is just an educated guess based on mannerisms and what they sound like and look like, so by no means take it as a definitive statement. This is Aaron Baker, at least what people on the internet think, and that's what I'm led to believe as well. The title may not be 100% accurate, just a disclaimer there, but I'm going to react to it as if it was him. Let's get straight into it.

Aaron Baker: “That's an interesting question.  I've been involved in bodybuilding since my mid-teens.  And I always had aspirations of turning pro, and just dreamed to be one of the top professional bodybuilders in the world.  But, as I improved in my younger years, I found out that I had good genetics for the sport, and I consider that a blessing.  So, I continue to train hard and work hard.  But even in my teens, the steroid issue was — it wasn't something that was hidden so much, it was addressed.  It just — it was addressed in that I knew that down the line, in order to remain competitive, I would have to entertain that idea and more than likely start to use them.  But I feel fortunate and I was taught that the farther I went without them and the harder than I train without them, the less I would have to take and, you know, just the farther I would go, naturally, and the less that I would have to subject myself to.  So, I really knew about them in my teens before I was even out of my teens.  But I personally chose to abstain from them from a number of years before I actually — before I actually did try them.  I remember refusing at one point in '84, and my friends were kind of teasing me with them, “Go on, go on, take one.” And I'm like, “No, no.” Because I just wasn't ready (INAUDIBLE)  In my mind, I wanted to go another couple of years.  And I also knew that it was inevitable, you know, based on what the feedback that I was getting from the sport, and also the quality of physique that was on a slightly higher level, the open class level.  And it was definitely a different look, but I knew that (INAUDIBLE) would come from diligence and hard work and persistence, and basically going after what I wanted.  So, I'd have to say, but in my teens is when I really found out about them, and really kind of being the inevitable because I did have aspirations of turning professional. So …” Testosterone Use Tom Platz: “What specific steroids do you use?” Aaron Baker: “Well, personally, I've really done well with some of the basic things like, you know, your basic testosterone, and there's three types that I usually use, Cypionate, which is a stronger (INAUDIBLE) type.  There's Propionate, which is a faster acting lighter oil-based type.” [4:20] It's not stronger, it’s probably just concentrated more densely with more active hormone in it because that's pretty common for Cypionate to be dosed higher per milliliter than Propionate or something like that. That’s probably what he means when he said stronger. Aaron Baker: “And Enanthate, which is another faster — it’s kind of in between the former two.” [4:52] Enanthate is not that fast, it's pretty widely considered a long ester, I would think. Primobolan Use Aaron Baker: “I've used — I was taught to balance the — what we call androgenic type of drugs, which are your strength building, mass building testosterones.  And couple that with something that was known as an anabolic type, which would be Primobolan, which I’ve used.  It was cheap, relatively cheap in comparison to some of the more designer type …” [5:32] That's funny because nowadays, Primobolan is the most expensive and the hardest to come by. Now I can see why all these guys seem to favor Primobolan back in the day so much. Aaron Baker: “… for lack of a better term, but I’ve really gotten a lot of results with the basics, which I would call testosterone: Primobolan, Dianabol, which is one of the older ones, it's been around for quite a number of years.” [6:00] Classic. Anadrol Use Aaron Baker: “I started using Anadrol a few years later, but I really have access to it so much the first four or five years or so.  And I have used Halotestin more in my latter years, maybe the second half of, you know, the amount of years that I’ve used them.  I've used a number of different types ranging from — what's it called, Parabolan, which is a …”  Parabolan (Trenbolone) Use [6:46] Parabolan is Trenbolone (Tren), the pharma-grade version of the drug from France. I did an article on that recently, if you want to see basically how that came about, why it was discontinued, what the protocol was for patients who were prescribed it, and more insightful information into Trenbolone. Aaron Baker: “… kind of has both properties of anabolic and androgenic.  And not so much androgenic, it's fairly balanced.” [7:12] A lot of people would disagree with that, but if you actually do look up the pharmacology of Trenbolone and its mechanism of action and selectivity for muscle tissue to prostate, and its actual level of selectivity for muscle relative to androgenic activity, it is actually pretty selective. It's just fairly often the dosages being used are so exorbitant and exceed even that of what's prescribed to beef up cattle, which is unnecessary. If you go look at the data, though, you can see how its tissue selectivity actually resembles a SARM in its action. Obviously, it's not to say it's exempt from androgenicity whatsoever because neither are SARMs, but it's actually far more selective than most anabolics that are used commonly, which is contrary to popular belief. It just the dosage people use are so high that causes massive amounts of androgenic activity. The anabolic to androgenic ratio really doesn't portray its actual level of selectivity very well. I believe it's like 500 to 500 on those traditional charts, which is not the case when you actually go look at the data. Winstrol Use and Testosterone Suspension (Water-Based) Aaron Baker: “The cutting drugs which are the highly anabolic drugs, and they use closer to competitions, predominantly your Winstrol (INAUDIBLE). Test suspension, which is another water-based milky (INAUDIBLE) type of substance.  And the anabolic, highly anabolic drugs were used closer to competition, the water-based because they tend to hold less water under the skin, so you can retain the harder look on any competition.  Well, in the offseason and the months a little farther back from the competition, you could depend on, you know, the more androgenic, oil-based steroids. But others …”  [9:25] I think that's pretty common practice, actually. It’s fairly consistent across the board. These guys are on long esters in the offseason, essentially, and then they swap out into the short esters or swap out into even the really fast-acting water-based stuff, which is in and out of your system in like a day. And those practices, more or less, still stay consistent to this day. I wouldn't necessarily say that oil base, in general, should be cut out though. Oral Steroid Use Aaron Baker: “I've used Anavar, which is an — excuse me — an anabolic, highly anabolic type tablets, which is popular in the mid-70's through the early 80's and up to the mid-80s' (INAUDIBLE) making it …” [10:15] I think this is the first pro-bodybuilder out of all the interviews I've seen that talked about Anavar, as well as Dianabol, I think, which is interesting. Obviously, this guy was probably really well-connected. He could get Parabolan Amps, he could get Anavar, he get Dianabol, he get whatever he wanted it sounds like so far. Aaron Baker: “There's also an oral Winstrol, which is also good for the cutting up phase.  Some of these are relatively weak, but you have your stronger dosages like Anadrol, which is one of the most toxic along with the Halotestin.  So, I've used — I've used all of those at one time or another, and some of them, I've always used.  I personally, always believe that less is more, you know?  And I also believe that training hard in the offseason would make the difference than (INAUDIBLE) competition.  But that's not always the mentality of the competitors, some people think more is better.  And some people wouldn't hesitate to take more in hopes of getting more progress.  And I think it's with the competition just growing, and with more money and more prestige, it does get competitive. It gets extremely competitive, and I think that people tend to pull out all stops from time to time.  And I mean, I myself have even taken the attitude of, well, you know, I'm going to drug it up this time, and show them.  And that wasn't my normal attitude, but when you're involved in it, you are (INAUDIBLE) you know, and if it's — if it's a factor in the game, and it was very much a factor, especially on the national and professional levels.  But even on the amateur levels, they have aspirations as high as anyone.  And I think it's important for them to learn safety as much as at the beginning level as possible.” Aaron Baker's Steroid Dosages Tom Platz: “Okay, in terms — specifically in terms of dosage, can you give me some idea as far as milligrams — we're talking about here in terms of the steroids?” Aaron Baker: “Okay. Now myself, I could get away with probably 1 cc of, say, Cypionate, which was 200 mg, if I could, you know, get a hold of that particular (INAUDIBLE) the bottle, along with an androgenic one.  You know, a couple those two together.  1 cc of each. I've really, really never gone above 1 cc of each, but I have stacked maybe three together, you know, at one time (INAUDIBLE) androgenic type of drug coupled with, you know, highly anabolic type of drug.  And then may — or maybe two anabolic, or something kind of in the middle.  And that's also with, usually, usually two different types of tablets.  Usually, a basic Anadrol, which is a strength (INAUDIBLE) mass builder.  Also, it's more of a water retainer, and usually one Anadrol.  I've rarely gone over one Anadrol, but I have gone two, but in my latter, the latter half of the — of my career.” [14:03] If you really think about how much that is weekly, that's 1 cc of Testosterone Cypionate and then 1 cc of something else per week. I don't even know if I'm interpreting what he said correctly because that was a lot of information at once. And then 50 mg of Anadrol per day would put you at 350 mg for the Anadrol per week plus 200 mg Testosterone, 550 plus something else. I'll just say 750 mg total per week, which is pretty damn low. Aaron Baker: “So, myself, in terms of dosages, I could really deal with that, you know, because I always trained hard and genetically, that's all I needed.  But someone that didn't have as good of genetics as I had, I think would be inclined to — and I have seen people that have been more inclined to increase the dosages. And that …” [15:01] Definitely the case, always the guys thinking, “the reason I don't look like them is because they're using more than me,” and it's often not the case whatsoever. Aaron Baker: “That's something that's rampant, you know …” Tom Platz: “So, like per week, though, on a weekly week basis.” Aaron Baker: “A week, I could get away with that particular dosage twice a week.  I'd hit it probably Monday and Thursday.” Tom Platz: “That dosage being, again?” Aaron Baker: “Again, 1 cc of Testosterone Cypionate, 1 cc of Primobolan, or — it depends on basically what anabolic I could get my hands on at that time to go along with — to go along with the androgenic testosterone, mass builder and strength builder.” Tom Platz: “Is there a difference in the amount taken or the type …” [15:57] I guess if he takes that twice a week, then that would be 50 Anadrol a day still, that's 350 a week, then we have 200 mg Testosterone Cypionate twice a week, which is 400 mg. So, we're at 750 mg, and then Primobolan, I'm assuming 100 to 200 mg per shot, and then depending on the concentration, I'm assuming it's probably like 100 mg/ml. Ultimately, he's probably doing 1 gram, if even. That's not very much, well, by Olympia standards, I would think. Aaron Baker's Offseason Steroid Cycle Tom Platz: “Is there a difference in the amount taken or the type sort of steroids taken versus the on-season versus the offseason?” Aaron Baker: “Offseason could be considered the first months of your preparations for competition.  It could be anywhere from six months out, it could be anywhere from three months out, depending on where you are, and when you decide.  It also depends on your point of origin.  When you're starting, you know, your program to compete.” Tom Platz: ” Do you ever not — I mean, is there ever a time during the year, a number of months, weeks when you do not take steroids?” Aaron Baker: “Now, in the beginning, I would only — I would only take steroids, as I started a program for a competition.  And in the offseason, I would just train naturally and train as heavy as hard as I possibly could.  And I felt that (INAUDIBLE) off allowed my own receptors to come back online and allowed my own body's physiology to …” [17:39] Receptors never go offline just to be clear. Androgen receptors don't downregulate, they upregulate in the presence of exogenous androgens, they don't go offline when you're pounding steroids. It is Myostatin that prevents you from just continually gaining excessive amounts of mass in the presence of those androgens. Aaron Baker: “… just do its job, and stay where it should be.  I'm having a more positive effect, you know, when I decided to start the steroids for competition.” Tom Platz: “So, the beginning was like eight weeks out or 2 months?” Aaron Baker: “Kind of eight weeks, probably about three months.  You know, they're primarily six week, as I learned it in the beginning, six week to 12 weeks cycles.  And then you go off for a month and let your receptors come back online.  In some cases, they weren't necessarily off, but it's just to give your body a rest from it, so that your own system doesn't (INAUDIBLE) how to do its own jobs. Aaron Baker's Contest Prep Phase Aaron Baker: “As I progressed in the sport and reached higher levels in the sport, you find out that some of your competitors are on a little more frequently.  And so, you tend to adjust your own levels with the competitors.  You know, you see one guy may be — may not be on all year-round, but he may be on six months before his next competition, as opposed to 3, or as opposed to 12 weeks.  And I'm sorry, as opposed to eight weeks or so.  So, there's a growing competition, and it really boils down to your own discretion, and what you feel is safe, or what you're willing to do for competition.  And (INAUDIBLE) sure thing is with prize money and with the prestige and status and recognition, it tends to motivate you to do whatever it takes.  And I think that's where the scary part comes in.  That's where the potential danger can enter into the picture.  Especially, if you're doing it under your (INAUDIBLE) expertise.  And your kind of following the advice of the quack house doctor, you know, this is what you take and you do that, and this and that.  I've had doctors advises in the beginning, and after a while, you kind of learned a little bit of — you know, you basically learned what not to do in the beginning.  And after that, just kind of use your own discretion.” Tom Platz: “So, six months would be probably the most you might take steroids in a year's time, or would that vary?”  Aaron Baker: ” I would think — I would say that that would be the most, but I have to be honest and say that there are times during the year when I might be doing exhibitions.  And I might just want to look a little fuller, or just look my best during the exhibition season.  So, I have to be honest and say that there are times that I have extended or kind of jumped on a little bit, not to get me in shape, but just to — for that extra little edge, that extra fullness or extra 10% of whatever it gives you.” Aaron Baker's Annual Steroid Cycle Cost Tom Platz: “What's the annual cost?  Well, what's your estimate, what's your approximate estimate of …” [21:16] I'm assuming this guy is probably more or less on year-round, as compared to some of the other guys that I've done the videos on. I don't know, obviously, anyone can be lying, but I'm just going to take for granted what they're saying is legitimate, so let's just base it off that when we're evaluating it just at a face level. Tom Platz: “… your annual cost, money-wise, dollar-wise to get in shape for a major event of the year?” Aaron Baker: “For a big one, as a professional, I think minimum, it's going to cost you roughly five grand, five to six grand, depending on your own particular dosages and appetites for it.  Some people have access to much more than the guys that move it.  And so, the access to much more, they can experiment on themselves, and they could basically try whatever they wanted to because they had access to it.” Tom Platz: “Some of the guys spend a lot more than …” Aaron Baker: “Oh, a lot more.  That was what I could get by, and sometimes I — it was — it was rarely less than five.  And that was I think (INAUDIBLE)” Tom Platz: “What — I know, there's people going beyond your own situation here.” Aaron Baker: “I know one champion in particular that used to spend minimum of $100,000.  Tom Platz: “$100,000 per year to get in shape?” Aaron Baker: “Yes, yes.” Tom Platz: “Wow. That's …” [23:02] It almost sounds like the cost factor comes down to growth hormone because only a certain amount can be allocated to steroids because steroids are not overly expensive. And then, I would feel like the guys getting closer to $15,000 plus are just the ones that are more liberal with their growth hormone dosages. At least that's my guess based on what I've seen in the past videos. Tom Platz: “… including GH, and …” Aaron Baker's Take On Esiclene Use Aaron Baker: “Yes, yes. But it would also include any in every little supplemental assist drug that would help — maybe something that helps tighten the scans and a new case or various types of assisting — it could be inflammatory drugs.  There's even something out now that has been out probably a year, year and a half called Synthol.  And it's supposed to be a step beyond the original inflammatory drug, which was Esiclene.  And that's, you know, worked …” [24:08] The mechanism of action of Esiclene and Synthol are totally different, though, but it's funny how it's so hyped up in these videos, and then it just turns out to be just sterile oil. Aaron Baker: “… based and, you know, it's actually an irritant, you know, it irritates the muscle and in flames for a couple of days.” Tom Platz: “These drugs like Esiclene can actually inject it upon into the muscle?”  Aaron Baker: “You direct it — you inject it directly into the muscle, and …” Tom Platz: “It increases the size of the muscle upon — for a short period of time?” Aaron Baker: “Right, for a short period of time. A couple of days or so.” Tom Platz: “Is that — do you use quite a bit by most of the guys?” Aaron Baker: “Yes. Yes. Now, because — and I'm sure there's some people that don't care for it, but it's a little something just a little bit more polished.  If you have a weak area that's stubborn or an area of a muscle that you'd like to change the shape or whatever.  Now, don't get me wrong, that's not going to put the muscle in place, that's where the muscle is not there, but it can enhance the shape or add a little bit more fullness to an area that otherwise is just not quite up to par, genetically, or whatever.  I mean, I've hit muscles in areas only — I mean, we're talking the week before the show, you know?  When I'm already in shape, I'm already as developed as I'm going to be. But, when you find out that your competitors are doing that, and you're in a realm of looking your best on that day — and those are probably a lot less harmful than the actual anabolic.  But, the Synthol, that's something that's being used now, and there's a professional that was in the premier competition, the Olympia this year, that has Synthol in his arms, and it doesn't look natural.  There's a discoloration from prolonged use.  They don't …” [26:15] I'm wondering if he's referring to Flex Wheeler. I just know from the 90's, that was like the most prolific supposed Synthol user, but I don't know. Again, I'm just guessing here, but his arms looked insane, but maybe these guys could spot out the Synthol use. Obviously, in the current day, you can see there's something definitely up with them. I'm wondering who is referring to here. Aaron Baker: “… flex, so for all practical purposes, it increases the fullness in the shape. [26:49] That was a weird coincidence. Talking about Flex Wheeler and I press play and then he says flex. Aaron Baker: “But it's so obvious yet it's allowed.  And it's kind of disheartening, but that's allowed.” Tom Platz: “How long does the effects last from this particular drug?” Aaron Baker: “I've never used that one myself, but I read a couple of articles on it.  I understand that you have to do it — that you do I think every week or every other week or something like that.  You're doing the various parts of the muscle.” Growth Hormone Use And Dosage Tom Platz: “Now, in terms of growth hormone, how many IUs per day would that be?” Aaron Baker: “I have gotten away with less is better.  I've used more at times and didn't necessarily get a desired effect.  I have heard also the prolonged use of GH and seen evidences of it expanding your organs, making your waist wider.  Basically, in essence, making you waste water and expanding your organs and changing the physique.” Tom Platz: “Okay, specific dosages, can you be (INAUDIBLE)” Aaron Baker: “For me, the first time I tried it, it was something like every other day, starting the 10 weeks out for a competition.  I've never taken more than 12 or 10 weeks before because I've been taught that longer than that, you give your organs a chance to expand and widen your waist.” Tom Platz: “So, how many IUs per day?” Aaron Baker: “IUs per day? For me …” [28:35] Tom is getting fed up. Aaron Baker: “I use probably about no more than 2, for me.” Tom Platz: “Some guys take a lot more, though.”  Aaron Baker: “Some guys take a lot more. I know, professionals that take — that have taken as much as 9.  Even some, I've heard as much as 12 or 15 …” [28:59] 12 or 15. I'm assuming those are the guys who were spending the upper end of the cost for the price of preparing for competitions. If you're only using 2 IUs, I'm sure that's probably why his preparation costs seem a lot more reasonable than most guys. I've experienced a similar thing through my stints of GH. More does not necessarily seem to equate to more muscle. The diminishing returns effect sets in very quickly. How much can you push your IGF up before you're just exacerbating extreme levels of acromegaly symptoms? You're not really inducing any greater level of anabolism past a certain point, and you're just screwing yourself up and giving yourself insulin resistance. I think that's something that goes totally overlooked. A lot of guys just think more is better with the GH, and I don't necessarily think that's the case. I used to believe that, as I was led to believe that because I used to read all the stuff on the forums. It was like, “whatever you can afford is like the best dose of GH.” Giving yourself as high of a dose makes you sleep all day and not able to go to the gym because you're so tired. Even when you do go to the gym, you have to smash pre-workouts and have 400 mg of caffeine just to get out of your chair. You're too tired to even eat, and you're going to bed for 12 hours a day, and you're not getting your calories in because you're sleeping all day. You have severely elevated blood sugar all day long, and you're burning out your beta cells, and you're giving yourself type II diabetes. It's not always more is better with GH, trust me. Aaron Baker: “To me, that just boggles my mind.  I can't conceive of that, or the need to.  And I don't believe that that's going to produce what they're trying to produce with it.  I don't think it's going to create shape. I think it basically will just raise your tolerance and cause you to have to take more.” Growth Hormone Use In The Offseason Tom Platz: “Prior — do you take GH — or in your opinion is GH to be utilized offseason or prior to the show?”  Aaron Baker: “Prior to the show more often. I think in the offseason, unless you're getting ready for something in particular, a certain project, where you require a certain look, I think it's a waste. You do tend to expand your muscle cells and that you can keep muscle that you put on with it, whereas sometimes with anabolics, if you don't keep eating or if you don't — you don't keep busting your butt and feeding yourself and maintain the training, you know, in any case, you could lose weight or not keep the muscle.  But with GH, it's supposed to expand, increase the muscle cells, so that you actually hold on to the new muscle that you put on.  And in many cases, it's not always so much as putting on new muscle. In some cases, it is because you're lucky enough to just …” [32:06] It's just a lot of broscience right now, but I'm not going to delve too deep into it. I think most of you guys probably would understand that this is not necessarily how it works. Aaron Baker: “And the right combination of training and nutrition, rest, the whole nine yards, setting the proper conditions for muscle growth.  But, it's something that …” Tom Platz: “Now, how long — how long do you — would you take GH? How many weeks or months?” Aaron Baker: “Personally, for me, 10 to 12 weeks. No — and no more than 12.” Tom Platz: “That being 2 cc's a day, approximately?” Aaron Baker: “2 cc's.  I've taken maybe 1 cc a day or one IU a day, and that's worked.  But, I also was taught that …” How Growth Hormone Works And When To Take It [33:00] 1 IU would probably barely put you out of the reference range. If you have high normal natural GH levels, I don't really see a point. Well, that's actually not necessarily true because you don't necessarily reap no benefits from depending on when you pin the 1 IU, but it seems pretty negligible to me. It's interesting, though, because a lot of people think the longer you're on GH, the better, and you have to be on it for at least six months for it to work. That's like the biggest myth ever. As soon as you pin it, your body starts converting into IGF in the liver, and the mechanism of action that occurs where you would get the benefits you're seeking out of it starts occurring right away. It's not like it takes six months to accumulate in the body. When a guy says he takes it 3 months of the year, I don't necessarily call BS on it, especially when it costs as much as it did back in the day to get legitimate stuff or the difficulty of obtaining it. It's not like they had a high-quality generics they could get like guys do here nowadays. Drugs like that, they're probably using drugs that cost like $1,000 a kit. I don't necessarily doubt what he's saying is what I'm saying. Aaron Baker: “… should have a day in between is better.  So, you can go two days on, one day off, which could work really well.  And I've also gone — I've also split up the dosages. [34:25] Two days on, one day off, or five days on, weekend off, that kind of thing, that's all just a money-saving tactic, it has nothing to do with the efficacy of the drug or preventing adaptation, or anything like that. I used to see that all the time, where people say you've got to use a drug for five days, and then take the weekend off. It's just people who want to make a kit last for a full month at the dosage they're using as opposed to daily usage, or just being conservative and drag out a kit longer. You're not helping the process in any way by taking two random days off of your week-long cycle. Aaron Baker: “Like, I've done once in the morning, and once an afternoon, and then that's enough, splitting up my dosages over two times rather than just taking it at one pop.  And I've also taken it just before bed and just training.  Now, insulin, that is its partner in crime.  After trying GH with anabolics, I had a phenomenal effect, brought my physique to a new level of definition.  It had been told that it was so much easier to prepare, that it would eat fat and this and that.  I mean, a lot of the stories were blown out of proportion, “Oh man, (INAUDIBLE) you have to eat junk food, you can eat junk food, everything and just get totally shredded,” you know, and that doesn't make sense, because …” [35:56] That's what people say all the time about Trenbolone and GH. You supposedly can eat whatever you want and can't get fat. That's incorrect. When you eat enough calories, you're going to get fat. Trust me, if you eat like a bird, that's when you'll not get fat. Aaron Baker: “The cleaner you eat, the better you're going to look, but …” Tom Platz: “So, the GH with (INAUDIBLE)” Aaron Baker: “With the GH.” Insulin Use Tom Platz: “And GH and the insulin together, you can …” Aaron Baker: “Now, that's a horse of a different color.  Now, as you see certain qualities of physique, you begin to notice minute differences, maybe a little bit more fullness here, maybe a sick looking roundness that this other guy may have.  And then, you find out — and I understand that (INAUDIBLE) tight-lipped dispersal of information because everyone is so secretive and competitive.  And if you have — if you're — if you're a threat, then you're even less likely to get it firsthand.  But as I found out about insulin and was shown or explained how to use it, there are dangers in using it because it's definitely something that you don't want to do haphazardly.  And you don't want to get your own insulin, you know, out of joint.  But, I did try insulin during a competition training phase coming into a show.” Tom Platz: “So, insulin is only before the show or is it during the offseason as well?” Aaron Baker: “I (INAUDIBLE) only before.  You know, with me, it was just before, and it was only for a certain amount of weeks.  It was a phenomenal response.  I had fullness like you wouldn't believe, and I have round muscle bellies, to begin with, naturally, but it even took what I have naturally to a different level.  A different fullness, different roundness, some different pump type and intensity. It was incredible, and it was definitely a vast marked difference.” Tom Platz:  “Dosage?”  Aaron Baker: “Dosage. Okay, there are two types of insulin predominantly that people use as a fast-acting R and a slow-acting N.  The N works over a period of hours, slowly released into your body.  And the R is a fast-acting insulin that actually kicks in relatively soon.  We're talking minutes to half an hour.  The danger is you definitely don't want to come into a carbohydrate deficit because you will go into an insulin — you will have what's called a reaction.  And I had it described to me the reaction …” [38:53] He's talking about hypoglycemia right now. Aaron Baker: “It is a suffocating sort of feeling.  It's actually — you get heavy, your breathing gets erratic, you start sweating like crazy, you know, it feels like you're inside (INAUDIBLE) bag almost.  And you need to get simple sugars into your system as soon as …” [39:16] The craving for simple sugars when you're going hypo, there's no other way to describe it, you're like in a cold sweat. You're just like, “I need sugar like right now.” It's pretty much exactly what he's describing right now, it's pretty accurate. Insulin Dosages Aaron Baker: “It's awesome.  So, what happened was the dosages — actually, we're talking a 10th …” Tom Platz:  “10th of a regimen?”. Aaron Baker: “(INAUDIBLE) every minute amount (INAUDIBLE) …” [39:53] Starting with 10 IUs. Tom Platz:  “Per day?” Aaron Baker: “No, per time.” [39:59] So, a 10th of a cc would be 0.1 ml, which would be 10 units, typically. Aaron Baker: “I think I tried the slow-acting, the slow-releasing in the morning.  I'm going to try to recall how I did it, but it's — I think it was one of each (INAUDIBLE) different times of the day, it was not together.  Tom Platz:  “Twice a day?”  Aaron Baker: “Or, twice a day, once before training and once in the afternoon before your second session.  But I have heard of people taking it after they train, you know, in order to quickly replenish and just suck everything into the muscle.  I recommended that you take protein with it after that.  But myself, I was taught that you don't need to go over a 10th.  And when you do start going above that, that's when you start playing with fire.” [41:05] Just having an arbitrary dosage like that, a 10th of a milliliter, that is the worst way to go about dosing insulin. Obviously, it should be based on your own blood sugar and level of insulin resistance or insulin sensitivity. In accordance with that, it's not like you just need protein with it to shove it in the muscle. It doesn't work like that necessarily. You're going to need some sort of fast-acting carbs to bring up your blood sugar after you crash it manually with the insulin. Otherwise, then you will go hypoglycemic if you do 10 IUs of Humalog post-workout after you're already depleted, and you don't have any carbs. That's how you would go hypo, but the preconceived or predetermine dosage of just a 10th though, there should be no arbitrary numbers being pulled out of thin air for what kind of dosage should be used. It should be based on your own physiology, your own fasting blood sugar levels, your own insulin resistance levels, and how much GH you're using, like a bunch of different factors. Just keep that in mind because obviously, it's easy to listen to these freakiest pro-bodybuilder ever, and you'd be like, “He obviously knows exactly what to do.” It's not like people should just go and pop 10 IUs of Humalog into their stomach fat every workout or post-workout every day, just because this guy heard how to do it. Learn how these things work. This guy is an example of insane genetics, but always take what he's saying with a grain of salt, and do the research yourself. Aaron Baker: “That's when you enter a danger zone.  So, I've always been pretty good about heeding guidelines.  And I'm thankful for that, you know, I wasn't caught up into the point of, well, you know, one …” Diabetics' Insulin Dosages Compared To Bodybuilders' Insulin Dosages [42:58] Maybe I should go look at how diabetics use their insulin and the dosages they use, you start to learn very quickly how arbitrary these numbers are that bodybuilders throw around, and how ignorant bodybuilders are to how blood sugar management and insulin use actually works. A diabetic will typically laugh at the way a bodybuilder handles insulin because it's not based on science at all, it's based on bodybuilder forum protocols, which is not the way to go about it. Aaron Baker: “… did this then three is going to do that.  That's how people get hurt, you know, and that's how people — that's how people really damage themselves and put themselves in the danger zone.  And it only takes one good time to blow it.  And, you know, I didn't want to lose my life and all of that.  (INAUDIBLE) doing it, I was stepping into a new level of attitude, you know, if you will, for the sport, you know?  And it makes you ask yourself, okay, what am I willing to do to win? And what aren't I willing to do?  Now, myself personally, I only did it for probably two preparations, and I didn't do it all the way up into the show, I stopped three weeks before the show, because it did hold water.” Tom Platz: “So, a total of how many weeks then?” Aaron Baker: “Total? Probably five or six weeks.  It did help some gains, but …” Tom Platz: “You stopped before the show, you said?” Aaron Baker: “Yes, I stopped about three weeks before the show.  It did hold water, but I know people that …” [44:41] It's crazy how many of these guys' protocols are designed around growing into shows. When I hear these guys talking about, “I use the insulin, the GH is 10 weeks out, and they helped me grow, etc.” I'm thinking if I wasn't in a surplus with enough anabolic support in conjunction with the GH and the insulin, while simultaneously being in a surplus, I'm not going to get anything out of this. But then, you have these guys who are just genetic phenoms growing into the show at five, six weeks out, where I would be on a treadmill trying to burn fat off in a 500, 600, 700 calorie deficit on fat burners while they're growing with insulin. I would not be touching insulin at five weeks out unless I was abusing GH and needed it. It's kind of crazy to hear how these guys went about their preps. Does Insulin Increase Body Fat? Aaron Baker: “… eat on it, and they step on stage with a big full look.  And probably the guys that you see that are always full, but they don't possess the deep delineations that they used to as an amateur.  And you see them always getting bigger, and the waist also.  If I could name names.  Actually, after the second time that I tried it, I had about three weeks to go before the show.  Now, six weeks out, I was looking phenomenal, I had no qualms about anything, it was working perfectly.  And three weeks before the show, I had my body fat checked, and I looked pretty good, but I wasn't as crisp (INAUDIBLE) thought I should be three weeks before the show.  With the amount of aerobics that I was doing and everything else, I felt I should have been a little crisper.  I looked great, you know, but I had my body fat checked, and it was higher than it should have been.  So, I learned that the insulin does promote fat storage.  So, I had to stop that, lower my (INAUDIBLE) carbs, increase my aerobics, really break my neck to get in shape, and salvage what I had started all these months of preparation for the competition.” Tom Platz: “So, you might use insulin in the offseason as well as on-season?”  Aaron Baker: “Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.” [46:57] If you haven't seen my article on “Insulin & Body Fat Gain – The Number 1 Reason Why 90% Of Bodybuilders Just Get Fat“, I highly recommend you check out the article. The article elaborates on things you should know before you just delve into that domain of performance enhancement because it's a very, very convoluted, and not a lot of people really know what they're talking about when it comes to insulin. Aaron Baker: “You can, you know, improve your pump, even in maybe protein synthesis, even the way the carbs load into your body.  I mean, it's just jammed into the muscle.  And then, by the next competition, I thought, “You know what, I don't need this, you know? I don't need the risk.  Excuse me, and I don't need — I have muscle, you know, (INAUDIBLE) known for full muscle or density or whatever I have.  And I thought, do I need this to have muscle?  No, I've been training for, you know, 20 years.  I don't — I don't need this, I don't need the risk.  But I mean, that was my personal choice.  I could use it — and also, insulin will enable you to carb up on (INAUDIBLE) and look great.  I mean, as a matter of fact, at times, it's recommended, just because you need simple sugars to pop the veins and everything and to really trigger it for the desired effect.  But there's a way to do that, and, you know, there's a way that you can blow it as well.  But there are people that — there's one athlete that went into (INAUDIBLE) one shot this year at the Olympia.” Carb Loading With Insulin And Its Dangers Tom Platz: “Insulin shot, what does that mean?” Aaron Baker: “It means that you get caught out on a limb without enough carbs and simple sugars in your bloodstream, and your body needs it. And the insulin drives up the consumption of it at a rapid rate.” [49:05] Basically, somebody tried using a bunch of insulin to carb load, I guess. What happened was it crashed their blood sugar, and then they were on stage perhaps, and obviously, don't have simple carbs present to just slam and call out on a limb with low blood sugar. In a state of hypoglycemia, where your body basically needs to get simple sugar or else your blood sugar is too low and you're in a hypoglycemic crisis, essentially. That's what he's referring to right now. Aaron Baker: “It's that fast-acting R uses them up real quick and loads it into the muscle, so you — that's why diabetics have the sugar tablets that they can pop.”  Tom Platz: “So, you faint and go into a coma, or …” Aaron Baker: “Oh, you can lock up. I mean, you can just lock up.  This particular athlete had problems with cramping, and … See, if you're dehydrated along with all of that, I think you're opening up for more competitions.  This athlete was ushered to the hospital and then pumped full of saline and electrolytes.  And he's fortunate, and I'm glad he was out in three hours, but …” Aaron Baker's Scariest Experience With Insulin Tom Platz: “Anything scary to you ever happened like that?  Anything like — any certain drug you go (INAUDIBLE) lots of terrible reaction like …” Aaron Baker: “Let's see.  I've had a reaction before, not a big one.  And I think it's because I didn't take, you know, these grandiose dosages.  But I'm — I've had a reaction to where I'm like, what is this? Oh, excuse me. This is weird, you know, I was …”  Tom Platz: “Insulin, though?” Aaron Baker: “Yeah. But …” Tom Platz: “Describe (INAUDIBLE) when you had it.” Aaron Baker: “Lightheaded, you break out into a sweat.  You feel like you're in a jar, you know, you feel totally uncomfortable.  You feel like, you know, and you feel hot and short of breath.” [51:08] You feel like raiding your pantry is what you feel like, and clammy, sweaty, and just panicky. Aaron Baker: “And you feel like something's wrong.  And feel lightheaded and tingly, almost like pins and needles.  I'm — I was fortunate I didn't have a big, big one, but I knew something, you know, was wrong.  And I had carbs, and that's something that makes you think also.  I've had close friends that were a little bit more free and loose with it.  You know, they took a few more chances, they've competed on it, they've carb up on it.  To me, it was just one of those things that — it's just what am I gaining from it?  And, you know, I could have — my last few competitions maybe have used it, maybe have been in a totally different half of the placings, maybe I could have been higher and everything.  But for myself, personally, you know, I can see my wife at my funeral, not knowing why I'm dead, you know?  And because I wanted to win like a few thousand dollars.” Tom Platz: “That's a concern?” Aaron Baker: “Oh, most definitely. I mean, I thought about all of that.  And it's like, you think I shared it with her? No.  Because why? Because she probably would have told me, “Look, that's dangerous, I don't want you doing that.”  And it would have been a valid concern, and she would have had every right as a wife to say that, you know, to express that concern, and it was dangerous.  But you will rationalize things to yourself in the name of doing better for yourself family.  And that's an unfortunate thing because with the increased usage and advancement in scientific warfare, chemical warfare involved in the sport, a lot of times it's greater risks.  And you may tell yourself and rationalize that you are doing it for your family, or that you are, you know, trying to take care of your home and whatever, but I really just wasn't comfortable with. It was, number one, undependable.  Number two, very dangerous.  Number three, it's just something in me that just didn't think it was worth it. Insulin Use And The Health Risks That Stem From It Aaron Baker: “You know, if I had a certain type of physique where (INAUDIBLE) being seen on stage or something like that, that's one thing.  But I got the physique that I've always wanted.  And even to place higher, it just seemed so — just seem so shallow, you know, to take that much risk.  You know, I mean, I think you have to look at things like that.  And they're safe ways to do it, but the safest way is, I mean, you think that it should be on stage, we should be tampering with elements and substances in our bodies that — I mean, like thyroids and insulin levels and things like that.  That stuff is like tinkering with your internal wire, your internal circuitry.  And I just don't think that we're really meant to do that.  And you hear rumors of people …” [54:48] If you screw up insulin, obviously, you can put yourself in a coma very easily. What I'm saying is the long-term ramifications of use, if anything, insulin could relieve stress on the pancreas in the presence of elevated blood sugar or something like that, induced by exogenous growth hormone use, or by excessive carb intake, and a million things that bodybuilders induce upon themselves. The steroids and the GH causing cardiovascular issues, enlarging the heart and the ventricle, and all these things, are the things that I'd be most worried about, not things that you would probably be lesser at risk of if you understood the science of insulin. I feel like some of the things that are fearmongered are not necessarily justified in contrast to the actual risk profile of the anabolics. You can easily shut down your HPTA horribly and not get it back, where thyroid is the opposite. I'm just comparing here because that's what he's basically trying to talk about how thyroid and insulin are way worse than steroids, essentially. I would argue insulin insensitivity or insulin resistance induced by growth hormone, or cardiovascular outcomes like massive heart enlargement, as well as via anabolics, all the things that come along with that, are far more likely to screw you up than abusing T3 and shutting down your thyroid and then having it come back online right after you come off. There's a lot of evidence that points towards your thyroid can just bounce back instantly pretty much, whereas with steroids, you could be on TRT for life just because of your abuse in a few years even. As well as GH, there's a lot of outcomes that a lot of people don't consider that are outside the scope of organ growth because that's not even the main thing I'd be concerned of personally. Anyway, I'm kind of getting off track here, but sometimes I see the wrong things. I feel like everything is justified to be demonized, don't get me wrong, but I think sometimes when people want to argue about certain things that seem are taboo things that are considered unhealthy, the most unhealthy stuff is the main thing like the steroids and the GH, in my opinion. Aaron Baker: “You know, I've heard one rumor that one guy has turned himself into a diabetic, and it could just be a rumor. Or, there could be some truth to it.  And I know this guy's a non-insulin user (INAUDIBLE)” Aaron Baker's Diuretic Use And Diuretic Tests Tom Platz: “Okay, well, how about things like diuretics, are they used? Aaron Baker: “Diuretics …  [57:52] This guy's quads, jeez. Those are some pants. Aaron Baker: “… have really been a real — a real supplement in terms of the competition peak as of — I believe about …” [58:06] Can we just sit and admire this bodybuilder classic 90's outfit? He got this vest/coat thing with a stringer underneath. Is that a stringer? I don't even know. Then he has the fanny pack on top of the tights. The 90's! Aaron Baker: “Two to three years ago, it's really been addressed by the premier sanctioning body of the professional competitions.  And it's — we actually had the pro shows, many of them, tested for diuretics.  Nowadays, there's a banned substance list, and get this, it's not steroids, it's diuretics.  Because strangely enough, they're doing it because they care about us.  But they don't check the steroids, how about that?” Tom Platz: “There's no steroid testing done at the major pro shows.” Aaron Baker: “No, there's not.” Tom Platz: “So, you don't need masking agents to — of any kind?”  Aaron Baker: “No, you don't. Now, there's been a couple of years that they tested the waters, and …” [59:18] I'd be interested to see what this list was of band diuretics they had back in the 90's because obviously they knew which ones were being used that everyone used. You had the Aldactone, the Dyazide, the Lasix. I'm wondering what was even on this list, to begin with, because obviously it was just a front to make it seem like they're testing. I'm not really sure what the point of it even was. Aaron Baker: “The qualities of the physiques were definitely downgraded by that, but you would expect that for the first time that, you know what, people will figure out ways to look better naturally, just as erratic testing, there's been, you know, forces you to go back to older ways, like combining Vitamin B6 with Vitamin C, which is, you know, an old way of flushing water out.  There's herbal diuretics that you can take that are not so harsh.  There's some potassium-sparing diuretics, but the ones that were in — being abused were Lasix, which indiscriminately pulls water from your body.  And people will take it to get that harder — rock-hard granite look.  Now, your body is 70% water, so if you just go pulling it out of everywhere, you're going to be pulling it out of (INAUDIBLE) you're going to be pulling it out of tissues and things that you need, your brain.  But for that question about diuretics …” Diuretics Dosage Tom Platz: “Again, dosage.” Aaron Baker: “Dosage.” Tom Platz: “Just before the show or …?” Aaron Baker: “Just before the show.” Tom Platz: “How long for the show?” Aaron Baker: “Usually, the most common and the safest is a potassium-sparing diuretic called Aldactone (INAUDIBLE) helps you — it spares the potassium in your body so you don't crash.” [1:01:15] I'm guessing he's going to do the classic Aldactone for the week before, leading up to the night before, half a Dyazide because that seems like what everyone's doing. It’d be interesting to see if he has the exact same thing. Aaron Baker: “(INAUDIBLE) so much and just throw your electrolyte balance off so much, but it can be abused.  And at one time, myself personally, one show — the first time, excuse me, someone told me I may need to take, they give me a certain dosage.” Tom Platz: “What was it? (INAUDIBLE)” Aaron Baker: “Dosage, I believe — and now I'm guessing from memory, but I can explain that — what actually happened.  They gave me, maybe, let's just say they gave me 100 mg tablets.  I started off with half for a couple of days, because you gradually introduce it into your system (INAUDIBLE) is in the third day, maybe one hole for a couple of days.  And then last four days — so, this is just the final week before the show, for four days.  And then maybe go up to 1-1/2 on Friday night or two on Friday.” Tom Platz: “Started before — it's the week before the show, you're saying?” Aaron Baker: “Right. Usually, the Monday or Tuesday before that competition (INAUDIBLE)” Tom Platz: “Every day.” Aaron Baker: “Right.” Tom Platz: “And then maybe when you start, a whole every day?” Aaron Baker: “Right. Now …”  Tom Platz: “What day would you start a whole?” Aaron Baker: “So, the whole probably a Wednesday. You know, you start half and increase now …” Tom Platz:  “You don't stop. You take Diuretics away through the show.”  Aaron Baker: “Right, all the way up to the competition day.  And when you start coming off, you start to (INAUDIBLE) not — you know, you don't have to go back down to one and then — but you could go half and then a half, just so your body won't rebound, you know, when you need to be taking pictures.  Your body is reacting to not being a new substance because you are manipulating it, you know, to flush out water.  And you get hard, boy, you get rock hard, very valuable tool. Diuretic Abuse And Its Dangers Aaron Baker: “But it has been abused.  There has been people taking far too much just to get that rock-hard granite, sliced up anatomy chart look.  But at the same time, they're throwing their electrolytes so far out of balance that it's literally dangerous to be up there.  Now, as good as they look, or we look, you know, I'm not pointing the finger because I (INAUDIBLE) I was in it.  As good as you look up there, you are so unhealthy in the time because your electrolytes are out of balance.  It's so hard to perform up there because you're so dehydrated, you're lightheaded, and you look fantastic.  When I was younger, before I won the state level and, you know, and what have you, someone had given me some diuretics that they had gotten.  I was at this girl's house and she had them, and I forget where I even got them, but they were red., I didn't know anything about them.  I took one and I may have taken two, and I was close to a show, already low carbed, and I remember waking up in the middle of the night, it felt like — it felt like my jaws were like being sucked in, you know.  And actually, it was an electrolyte imbalance to where my muscles were contracting by themselves.  I mean, I woke up in the middle of the night like scared to death.  I'm like, “what is happening?”  You know, and I got up and went in the bathroom and looked, and I looked great, by the way.  So, I mean, I just took some salt, you know, because I didn't know what to do but something simple — take some salt, eat something, you know?  So, I ate and then it subsided, and then, you know, the next day, I'm like, you know, I just got rid of it.” [1:05:36] Time to switch the video cassette here. Hang on. Tom Platz: “So, the — if you find the diuretics effect (INAUDIBLE) prior to an event, the week before an event, and described the dosage pattern of the specific Aldactone you utilize.” Aaron Baker: “Right.” Tom Platz: “Is there any masking agent to —  Aaron Baker: “For Aldactone, I don't believe so.  But I — on the diuretic, before I answer that, incidentally, I did have — and I’ll explain how I took the dosages the first time.  I had them written down.  Now, the next time (INAUDIBLE) Aldactone, it was a higher dosage, and I didn't clarify that it was a higher dosage.  I just assumed that it was the same thing I got before.  It was twice the amount.  So, I follow the same procedure, and on the day of the show, I looked great, but I was sick to my (INAUDIBLE), I could barely carb up. I was nauseated, I could barely, you know, take in my carbohydrates to fill my physique out, I could barely eat, even after the prejudging, I was so nauseated I could barely conduct an interview, I just wanted to be left alone. I got back to my hotel room, and it was so hard to eat food.  And it was, you know, something that I would otherwise find really palatable delicious, and I could barely get it in.  I could barely drink water and everything.  And then, I realized later that it was because I had taken too much, too much.  And I also took herbal energy tablets (INAUDIBLE) to have the stamina to pose on stage.  So, herbs on your stomach, you know, on an empty stomach combined with your electrolytes being topsy-turvy, I was just — I've never felt sicker in a competition.  And later, I learned that that's what it was — it was from diuretics.  And I thought I was following everything to the letter but I neglected to make sure to confirm what I had taken before and confirm, you know, what I was taking this time.  So, there is an incident of my own personal experience that’s — it was pretty harrowing.  Now, you asked me something …” Masking Agents To Cover Up Diuretic Use Tom Platz: “Masking agents.” Aaron Baker: “Masking agents.” Tom Platz: “For diuretics. Since those are the only things that on the hot top pro shows you’re being tested for.” Aaron Baker: “Now, the list is quite extensive.  But, there's always a couple of things that aren't up there.  I, this year, learned of something that one of the reigning pros, if not the reigning pro, was — now, this was said — I can't swear to it.  This was told to me, I'm not trying to gossip, but I'm just stating what someone mentioned to me.  And (INAUDIBLE) I've, you know, learned that to the person that trained him for it, has a few tricks up his sleeve.  It's heard that he used a — and you'll find that this is — I'm not the only person that knows about this.  This is — and I shouldn't have known about it, you know what I mean?  So, it was just being discussed behind, you know, yeah, he used this. That's why he looked (INAUDIBLE) shoulders above everybody else at this show and at that show.  An IV drip.  You know, I don't know exactly how it works, but there's something in that — they drip an IV into the arm like the night before the show.  I've also heard mentioned from the same source of expertise that some blood dope might have been — might have been used or incorporate, or that could be how they made that work.” [1:09:52] See, I don't see why anyone would blood dope. You're already on so much exogenous anabolics that are cranking your blood viscosity and red blood cell count through the roof. What do you gain by blood doping at that point? That's just asking for a stroke or something, in my opinion. Tom Platz: “IV drip would be in regards to …” Aaron Baker: “Intravenous — sorry, (INAUDIBLE) from my things again. Intravenous drip into the arm.” Tom Platz: “What specific drug is this?”  Aaron Baker: “I can't remember the name.  It's some weird name, and (INAUDIBLE) an M. There's also a diuretic that is not detectable begins with an M that …” Tom Platz: ” This would be a mean to get around the test?”  Aaron Baker: “This is the means of getting around the test.” Tom Platz: “For the diuretics?” Aaron Baker: “Yes.” Tom Platz: “I see.” Aaron Baker: “And this guy, one hands down because he's like …”  [1:10:45] I actually have no idea what he's talking about either, so this is kind of interesting. Aaron Baker: “One of the sports favorite sons, according to this sanctioning body, you know, you can do no wrong, but he was head and shoulders like at phenomenal shape, deserved to win, he looked great, you know, that year, or those two shows.  And I was in those shows, but he looked great, he looked phenomenal, he deserved to win.  He was the best man that day, but an IV, you know, how?” Tom Platz: “This is something you haven't done before?  You're pretty sure this is what's some of the top guys are doing?”  Aaron Baker: “Yes, and since then, the guy that's been mentoring him on it has been helping out a few other professionals, and sort of, expanding his stable and becoming sort of a guru, if you will.” Tom Platz: “Do you have any idea what's in the IV drip, or …?” Aaron Baker: “(INAUDIBLE) told me but it's like something I never heard of.  And I only heard it about two or three times, and a lot is going on, you know, since then.  And I wish I could recall it.  Yeah, I'd state it right here.” Esiclene And Synthol Use Tom Platz: “You mentioned before, real quick, Escaline and another …” Aaron Baker: “Esiclene.” Tom Platz: “Esiclene, something similar to that?” Aaron Baker: “Yes. Esiclene is an inflammatory, a water-based irritant that's injected directly into the muscle.” Tom Platz: “Before the event, primarily?” Aaron Baker: “Before — well, actually a couple of days or before.  I mean, even the same guy that I just mentioned about the IV drip, in '93, he was winning, it was said that he used to hit each body part with it.” Tom Platz: “Now, the other drug that you're talking about which is like that drug?” Aaron Baker: “Okay, then, that's a newer.” Tom Platz: “Called?” Aaron Baker: “It's called Synthol.” Tom Platz: “What would be like the — how many cc's …” [1:12:48] Synthol is not a drug, it's just sterile MCT oil with some Lidocaine at maybe, alcohol. That's it, it's just oil. Tom Platz: “… did you put into a muscle like the bicep?” Aaron Baker: “I think that you would put about half per time.” Tom Platz: “What have you done?” Aaron Baker: “I've never used that.” Tom Platz: “Okay.” Aaron Baker: “That's (INAUDIBLE) out. And you know, it's been offered to me.” Tom Platz: “How many cc's in the bicep or …” Aaron Baker: “One? I mean, I'm not trying to…”  Tom Platz:  “You would never use like 10 or 20 cc's?” Aaron Baker: “Oh, no, no.  I think that'd be a big — you have a lag and a big deformed trunk.” Tom Platz: “Do you find it actually does increase the muscle size upon injection site (INAUDIBLE)” Aaron Baker: “Yes, yes, and not to a great degree, but then again, I never tried to blow up my entire muscle.  I — if my outer bicep I wanted to be a little bit more fuller on that day, I would hit it there.  And it would give the desired effect, and it was temporary. Aaron Baker's Advice And Frustrations About Bodybuilding Aaron Baker: “One thing that I would like to touch on and emphasize is that the whole reason that I'm discussing this here today is because I really believe that this tape will help some people, and I wanted to educate them.  Not to paint the athletes out as Frankenstein monsters.  And this is not about (INAUDIBLE) I mean, I've — I'm definitely as in as anyone.  But there's a lot of things that I won't do for the sport.  And also, the feeling of being drawn into it and feeling that you must do this in order to remain competitive.  And that's what I think is the real shame is how far do we have to go in order to be deemed great champions?  You know, when did being healthy and looking good seized and we stepped into chemical warfare so much that we don't even look at the effects?  And what will we accept in terms of what we will do, and how far will that go?” [1:15:04] You'll see in the next 20 years, it gets a lot worse. Actually, I don't know if it's going to continue to get worse. I feel like some people are going to start to realize as more of this kind of content emerges. I don't know why this video got buried. This is such good message to send to people that are delusional about what pros do and the potential health ramifications of blasting your androgen index 100 fold above what you need or taking stupid amounts of GH, and insulin, and what you should expect from reasonable dosages if you have the genetics for it. I don't think all these guys are lying. They all seem to have dosages a lot more in line with what a moderate user would use nowadays when you see guys at 185 pounds using more than these guys even nowadays, it's nuts. Aaron Baker: “I have come her sad dreaded having a stick myself coming to a competition, you — when you get leaner and leaner, you get sore from the injection sites.” Tom Platz: “So, you change the injection sites.” Aaron Baker: “Yes. And you start looking for ow, that still hurts, you know.  And closer to a show, the water-based drugs are in and out of your system faster.  So, you have to do them every other day instead of just twice a week.  It's a dread, it's a sense of dread.  It's something that I hate having to do.  And I hate the negative connotation of being along with it.  I enjoy training, I always have, I enjoy the lifestyle and the look.  The positive things that it's brought me, but one thing I honestly hate, and this is from the heart, is having to address the issue to people that don't understand what I've been through, that don't know me as a person, or how hard I've worked.  And they see some short expose on steroids, and you know, they think they're being brilliant by going (INAUDIBLE) steroids. You take steroids, right?  It's like, I don't want to discuss it with you, you're a moron.  I mean, you don't know what you're talking about.  So, you know, if I could discuss it and actually teach you something, then it would be worth discussing with you.  But the negative connotation that goes along with it, I consider myself a hardworking professional athlete, but I don't enjoy carrying the stigma of being a steroid user.  And I'm not one prone to roid rages and all of this and that.” Aaron Baker's Take On Roid Rage Tom Platz: “Does that exists?” Aaron Baker: “I think that …” [1:17:49] This guy seems pretty eloquent and well-spoken. I'm not sure if this guy was one of the most prolific guys in the 90's, but Honest to God it sucks that these guys didn't get the exposure that they deserved back in the day because these guys would be, you know, superstars nowadays with social media and whatnot. Aaron Baker: “It's like some other drugs, they magnify who you are.  If you're a jackass without them, then you'll be twice the jackass on certain — under certain conditions.  Now, the average Joe, if he hasn't eaten in three hours, he's going to be cranky, but the average grandma hasn't eaten in three hours will be a little, you know, erratic around the edges, you know.  Aaron Baker On Raising Awareness Of Steroid Abuse Aaron Baker: “But I really believe that this tape will help people.  Coming up as a youth, all I saw was that I will be a professional, and it has progressed quite a bit since that time.  But I do want people to not view it as all these guys are freaks and monsters and drug heads because it's not that simple.  There's a lot of fine athletes and a lot of fine people in this sport, but it's just a shame that we're drawn down this road.  And the sad part is the establishment, the officials, the administration, the powers that they're just standing by long enough to make the money.  And I believe that if our health was such an (INAUDIBLE) naturally, they're testing for diuretics because they don't want anyone else dying.  If they're emphasizing that it's for our own good and for our health, why aren't they testing for steroids, because we make much better products and sell many more magazines with the enhancement of steroids than without.  I personally think (INAUDIBLE) champions would be would be — would be at the top because of hard work, and genetics, and diligence, and nutrition, and what have you.  So with that, I just wanted to, you know, contribute to maybe enlightening somebody about it.  And not in a negative way, because one thing I do resent personally is someone that has no genetics, they've tried to win a bodybuilding at a certain level, and just didn't have what it takes.  And then they go on this steroid — anti-steroid crusade where they slam pro-bodybuilding, and they call us muscle heads, and they call us drug monsters, and all and this (INAUDIBLE).  They try to do the same thing and failed, and then decided to go on a crusade, I really resent that a lot.  You know, there's magazines and there are people that always have to bash.  And that I just — that's just a (INAUDIBLE) that I don't have much respect for.  But, you know, I thank you for listening, and I hope that …” Tom Platz: “Thank you. Appreciate your involvement very much.  And hopefully, we will educate and we will teach from the up and coming guys really what it's all about.  Not to expose the dirty laundry of sport — of sport form of bodybuilding or other sports, but to make a difference in the sense that we educate, and maybe there's less abuse of procedures they will follow.  And we can get the clear the real understanding of what the sport has evolved to, at this point, because it's something that we, in fact, we do love and it's where we live, it's where we come from, it's our home, it's our neighborhood, and we care about.  At this point, it's time I think somebody really addresses the subject and talks about the way it really is, and what's honestly happening in hopes that there will be less abuse of procedures, less deaths in the sport, and more education.  And hopefully, maybe I said — as I said, less use, and maybe if the testing work to get real, and it could be real if I understand this.  And the IOC is increasing their standards, maybe they'll be a level playing field and will be a lot safer to compete in today's environment, which at this point, as you refer to chemical warfare, and that's the reason for this tape.  Again, it's not to expose the dirty laundry, to expose athletes by any means, it's merely to educate, and to help the problem and to help alleviate some of the problems involved in our sport.” Conclusion On Aaron Baker's Steroid Cycle [1:22:40] It kind of sucks how that message obviously kind of got lost over the years. I don't think I've seen anything since the 90's up to even maybe the past few years, that's really delved into this hard like that. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to have a good outcome as far as the goal of that tape, but I feel like it's good to bring to light now, especially because it's super enlightening for the young guys who have high aspirations to see something like that, and to really understand genetics and what it takes to be at the top. Put it in perspective and understand the potential risks and limitations you have on your own outcomes in terms of what you can accomplish and what could be a pipe dream to you. Perhaps just have realistic expectations and understand what you're getting yourself into is what I'm trying to outline with these videos. Obviously, exposure of this content, I feel, is good to get out to my audience because I'm sure a lot of you guys haven't seen this, and I didn't even know about it until relatively recently too. It was even eye-opening for me. I suspected for a long time that they probably didn't use as ridiculous of dosages as people asserted and thought they did. Honestly, it was even lower than I thought, but they could be lying, they could be not. I feel like they're probably more or less telling the truth for the most part, so take from that what you will. Aaron Baker's Steroid Cycle After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Aaron Baker's steroid cycle dosages, he claims his use broke down to the following: Testosterone Cypionate – 400 mg per week. Primobolan – 100-200 mg per week Anadrol – 50 mg per day Parabolan – Dosage was not specified Winstrol, Dianabol, Anavar, Halotestin – Reserved for specific phases pre-contest or during mass gaining phases. Dosages were not specified. These were not all utilized at once, he simply mentioned he has used them before, hence them being added to this list.  Growth Hormone – 2 IUs/day, every other day, for 10-12 weeks pre-contest only Insulin – 10 IUs administered twice a day pre-contest only   Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

This interview conducted with Tom Platz was intended to remain anonymous. But, the internet is the internet, and people can figure out pretty easily with deciphering the 90's technology of looking at these blurred faces and listening to the noise distortion to make an educated guess about who it is. It might be Paul Dillet, but it could be someone else, so just keep that in mind before delving into this transcript/article. This is just an educated guess and doesn't necessarily mean that's who is in this video. Without further ado, let's get into it.

You know, wanting to win.  And, you know, we all start at an early age.  So, you're young and kind of a hothead.  The only thing you care about is number one.  So, if someone gives you anything, or tell you about anything, that's going to give you an edge.  So, you know, for myself, it's — that was what it is just, you know, just wanting to win.” Tom Platz: “At what age did you start taking?” Paul Dillet: “I was 23.” Tom Platz: “Okay.” [2:19] 23 years old? I guess back then 23 seemed young. You have kids who are 16 now that are saucing. That's kind of crazy how they consider that really young back then. Now, that would almost be conservative nowadays. Tom Platz: “I'd like to — I know these are sensitive issues and you're not used to talking about it, but again, your identity is protected, Okay? And no one's going to know who you are except me and, of course, it will never come from me. I assure you that. What specific steroids do you find effective for your training?” Paul Dillet's Testosterone Use Paul Dillet: “Well, I guess in the offseason, you know, you're basically I'll say staying as best — I'll stay with the basics.  Still something, you know, American — something that, you know, you can get a prescription from of, you know, go to a pharmacy, and get some (INAUDIBLE) which would be like, any kind of Testosterone.” Tom Platz: “You can — you have the ability to get prescriptions and legally and …” Paul Dillet: “Yeah, you can get a prescription. You know, I think that's still something (INAUDIBLE) because I'd …” [3:23] That's interesting, because a lot of guys assume people in the 90's didn't use Testosterone very often. The classic 70's and 80's era, everyone thought Testosterone was something that just wasn't even used. A lot of people think in the 90's no one really touched Testosterone either but evidently, there were doctors prescribing it to bodybuilders. Paul Dillet: “You know, regardless of what anyone says, you know, athletes are going to do what they're going to do to win. And they think that maybe it's better for them to write someone a prescription so they know what they're getting is real, instead of on the black market and get something that isn't what it's supposed to be. And (INAUDIBLE) just going to inject into his body and, you know, do — does more harm than anything else.” Tom Platz: “Yeah, I've had people I know injected (INAUDIBLE) into the system and all kinds of things.  Paul Dillet: “Without saying (INAUDIBLE) Testosterone is one of your basics — one of the basic things that …” Testosterone Cypionate + Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca) + Anadrol Use Tom Platz: “What form of Testosterone do you find most effective in terms of your regime?” Paul Dillet: “For the offseason, I think Cypionate is best mixed with Deca with, you know, (INAUDIBLE) but also …” [4:40] Cypionate is a long Ester Testosterone if you aren't aware. Deca, is a long Decanoate ester attached to Nandrolone, and Nandrolone Decanoate is the official name, but it's commonly referred to as just “Deca”. Testosterone + Deca is a pretty standard combination, even nowadays. Paul Dillet: “… will have some androgenic properties, and it also combined with maybe one oral, maybe Anadrol, something like that. Anadrol 50, you know, maybe one to two tablets a day, depending on the body of the person.  You know, so sometimes some people might think that if I (INAUDIBLE) one a day, I get this much.  But if I do three or four, I'll get that much, which is actually, for me, that's actually the reverse.  I think it's best to take a small — a small amount of three, four different things than to try to cram two things into your body and overload your system.” [5:44] I agree with that too. Obviously, not in the context of performance-enhancing use, of course. I'm just saying that if I was still trying to push the envelope with higher than TRT dosages, that would be my preferred approach as well, rather than overloading my system with something that fulfills one mechanism of action, using smaller amounts of several pathways of growth with less overall side effects and more compounding growth. Anadrol at 50 to 100 mg per day seems pretty common among the 90's guys, which isn't much. I'm surprised I haven't heard any Dbol use yet. I think maybe that was more 70's, but I thought that would be chosen a bit more among these guys. You would think you'd take after what the guys before you did and sort of adopt their principles, but it doesn't necessarily seem like that's the case. Seems like Anadrol is the go-to oral of choice. I suppose probably because it had more clinical application at the time being prescribed for an array of people, including children. It was probably a lot more readily accessible, I would think. I don't know for sure, though. Paul Dillet's Offseason Steroid Cycle Tom Platz: “Well, along the lines of your speaking of dosages, I mean, relative to the drugs you just mentioned, in the offseason, since we're staying in the offseason, what would those be like?” Paul Dillet: “I think, you know, for a guy that's 240 lbs, 400 mg of 500 mg Cypionate a week is sufficient. You know, I've heard stories of guys doing whole bottles in one week, which is — that's nuts …” [7:29] 400 to 500 mg a week of Testosterone, that sounds a lot lower than people would assume somebody this is size would be taking, that's for sure. Over the years, I've realized the shortcomings to overloading a pathway that just aromatizes into estrogen and 5-alpha reduces into DHT, which is a terrible hormone for muscle building. I don't think that overloading that pathway is a smart way to go. I think 400 to 500 mg of Testosterone makes complete sense when in conjunction with other things with efficacious dosages for the intentions of this protocol. Paul Dillet: “It's crazy. You know, all you got to do is — those are the kinds of guys you know, they're red, they're bloated, they have really bad skin.   That's a sign of, you know, you're overtaxing your body.   And your body is not utilizing it.   So, it's — you know, your body is trying to secrete it through your pores.  You know, so that dosage would be more than sufficient for anyone.” Tom Platz: “So, if you combine that with …” Paul Dillet: “With another 400 mg of Deca. Or 1 to 2 Anadrols a day.  Tom Platz: “Per week, 400 mg of Deca a week?” Paul Dillet: “Yes. And 1 Anadrol a day.” [8:49] 400 mg of Deca per week with 400 to 500 mg Testosterone with 50 to 100 mg of Anadrol per day. It's funny because that's something that a lot of guys would do on their first or second cycle nowadays. Maybe even more than that. A lot of people wouldn't believe that that's a dosage that would be sufficient for somebody of this size. Could he be lying? Of course, obviously, but it's entirely possible he's telling the truth. Frankly, I think if you have freak genetics, you have Myostatin deficiencies and polymorphisms, you can become an incredibly successful bodybuilder with what would be considered by many to be moderate dosages. It doesn't really come down to stupid high dosages. I just think it comes down to saturating androgen receptors, then eating enough food and training. This guy is using 400 to 500 mg Testosterone, which I don't think you really get a whole lot above and beyond that, when you start pushing it above 500 mg, where you're just forcing yourself to need AI's, which is going to hinder IGF-1, it's going to smash your lipids. Even worse, it's going to inhibit the literal mechanism of growth which you sought to max out by using something that aromatizes into estrogen in the first place. And then adding Deca in conjunction with 50 to 100 mg of Anadrol, that's super modest in today's standards. Paul Dillet On Drug Use Transitioning To Contest Prep Paul Dillet: “That's more than enough.” Tom Platz: “Now, how long might you do that during the offseason?” Paul Dillet: “I think you do that maybe — you don't have to do anything throughout the whole year.  If you have a show, you might want to start 16 weeks up.  And you would do that for the first — from 16 weeks up to 10 weeks.  Once you get to the 10-week period, then you want to switch from Deca and from Cypionate.  What you want to switch to is maybe Propionate, which is quick acting, stays in the system.  A lot shorter time goes in a lot quicker, and it doesn't retain all that water.  So, that would be good.  And I get …” [11:05] I don't necessarily buy into that either. I used to think the same thing that maybe Enanthate and Cypionate and Decanoate and long esters hold more water. Maybe they do to some extent, but I've seen a lot of guys come into shows on long esters and get lean enough, and as a result get really dry. It's just a matter of losing enough fat most of the time from what I've seen. The whole switch to short ester thing, I'm not really sure. In practical application, I'm not certain it makes a huge difference. I think it just comes down to if you're too fat or not at the end of the day. There's evidence in the clinical data that shows increased nitrogen retention with the long esters. Whether that also equates to some intramuscular water, I'm not really sure. Arguments can be made both ways. I don't think it really makes it a big difference, either way, to be honest. But, it's interesting to see where that theory came from because the guys in the 90's were even doing this, and still to this day that is a commonly adhered to principle precontest. Primobolan Use Paul Dillet: “… Deca, I mix it up with Primobolan Depot, which is a pure anabolic, at the same time … [12:21] At 10 weeks out, he's swapping the short ester from Testosterone Cypionate to Testosterone Propionate, and he's adding in Primobolan. He's saying it's pure anabolic, which is not actually true. In reality, it does have a level of androgenicity and I've actually covered that in a recent article, where I compared 1200 mg of Primobolan to 300 mg of Testosterone Propionate in a clinical study. Granted it does have a favorable ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, but it's by no means purely anabolic, where you have no androgenicity whatsoever. It's still going to induce virilizing side effects in women. It's still going to cause androgenic sides in men, it's not like a SARM. Even SARMs aren't 100% tissue selective, nothing's come that far yet. Therefore, it's not purely anabolic, just as a reference there. Paul Dillet: “…androgenic effect.” Tom Platz: “The doses of the Primo …” Paul Dillet: “The dose of the Primo, Primo is really mild, perhaps want a safer, safer (INAUDIBLE)  So, you could do 500 to 600 mg of that per week.  And (INAUDIBLE) the Anadrol in, but what you'd want to do is cycle it.  So, if you started 16 weeks out, you can go one month straight and stop for a month, then you get on again to give your system a chance to take — get a break.  And also, you might become a creature of habit, so it doesn't get adapted to it. [13:53] I have some critique about what he just said. Granted I'm just some dude reviewing information from a super genetic phenom in the 90's. But, keep in mind, he didn't have access to the internet, and we can actually look at clinical studies and do extensive research. Anyway, the first thing he said, which should be noted is the dosage of 500 to 600 mg of Primobolan per week, which I feel like a lot of people would consider may be moderate, but even perhaps low based on what a lot of guys are doing. Most guys won't run Primobolan less than 700 mg because they think it's so weak. And then he's talking about how you should cycle off the Anadrol every four weeks and then go back on four weeks to give your body a break because your body is going to get used to it. Well, first of all, giving your system a break, I don't know if he's referring to your liver due to its hepatotoxicity, which I could understand. It's funny because this arbitrary four weeks on, four weeks off rotation has been passed through the grapevine for decades. Is this based on some sort of consistent bloodwork that has shown at the four-week mark, your liver enzymes are cranked through the roof, and then you need four weeks to come off and clean them up to baseline? I don't really know. I doubt it. In clinical data, it's not like they're cycling patients on and off of Anadrol every four weeks. I'm assuming that's what he's referring to is the liver toxicity of Anadrol. Secondly, he's mentioned the body getting used to Anadrol. That's not the case, whatsoever. Androgen receptors actually upregulate in the presence of exogenous androgens, they don't downregulate contrary to popular belief. What does happen however is that when anabolics enter the body or are endogenously produced, Myostatin elevates in parallel to prevent you from gaining too much muscle. Unless you're Myostatin deficient, then that's a bit different, but 99.999% of people have functioning Myostatin genes without genetic polymorphisms. Myostatin increases, which would then inherently inhibit your progress just due to the presence of the hormone, not because your body gets used to it necessarily. When you're in a calorie deficit too, the point is to retain tissue, it's not to necessarily grow. I'm not sure what is accomplished via going on and off in the theory of your body “getting used to it”. I guess, it sort of gets used to it, but it's more so your inherent defense mechanism preventing you from getting to 400 pounds of lean muscle because your body is not supposed to get that muscular. There are feedback loops in place to regulate that. Growth Hormone Use Paul Dillet: “About 10 to 12 weeks, I started some growth hormone with that. You know, again, that goes by body weight, you know, and …” Tom Platz: “Okay. So, what you've used in the past in terms of growth hormone might be …” Paul Dillet: “For my myself, I've never — I've never gone up to as high as (INAUDIBLE) IUs a day. We hit all sort of — again …” [17:18] By the way, this is a VHS tape, and those glitches on the audio, where it cuts off his voice, that's not me, that's them. Right there where you couldn't really tell what his dose was, that was not my doing, unfortunately. Paul Dillet: “Yeah, this is — this you would do maybe about 12 weeks out.” Tom Platz: “Okay. But to increase the offseason, you're calling the first month …” Paul Dillet: “The first month, because, you know, there's no reason — if you do two shows a year.” [17:57] I don't know if he said eight, I can't even tell. Paul Dillet: “It all goes by the body weight.  You know, each individual is different.  So, again, more is not necessarily better.  I just felt that a good mixture of (INAUDIBLE) growth hormone mixed with Primo and Deca, somehow it just — gone up to as high as 10 IUs a day.” Paul Dillet: “It all goes by the body weight. You know, each individual is different. So, again, more is not necessarily better.  I just felt that a good mixture of (INAUDIBLE) growth hormone …” [18:43] That's true, I should touch on is more is not better, especially in a contest prep phase. If you're trying to use growth hormone for hyperplasia and boosting your IGF in the offseason to grow, that's one thing, where blasting your levels to acromegaly levels, perhaps makes more sense. But, in the context of lipolysis, your lipolysis benefits are pretty much maxed out at a few IUs per day, depending on your body weight. That's with a feedback loop in place where those dosages need to be split up. There's definitely a huge diminishing returns effect in a contest prep with GH, just as a reference point there. Paul Dillet: “… mixed with Primobolan and Deca, sometimes with just Testosterone (INAUDIBLE) mixed together as a good combination for a pre-contest.” [19:33] If you want to see the data on that, by the way, I don't want to get into like a 20-minute rant about the clinical data that supports that statement regarding limited lipolysis effects via GH dosages, go look at my article A Comprehensive Analysis Of Eric Kanevsky’s Steroid Cycle. Somewhere in the middle there, I detail exactly where the rate of diminishing returns is in regards to lipolysis with exogenous GH usage. Importance of Cleaning Out Your Body Of Steroids Tom Platz: “So this is like, again, four months out, right?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah, this is (INAUDIBLE) maybe on 12 weeks out.” Tom Platz: “Okay, but to increase the offseason, you're calling the first month …” Paul Dillet: “The first month because, you know, there's no reason — I mean, if you do two shows a year, realistically, you only need 12 weeks. So, you go on for 12 weeks. It takes your body 12 weeks to get yourself in shape. Once at 12 (INAUDIBLE) time period is up, your show is here, it's over, it's done. You detoxify yourself, drink a lot of fluid. You take Saw Palmetto for, you know, for your (INAUDIBLE). Milk thistle for the liver, you know, dandelion, all these things. Cranberry pills for the kidneys. And, of course, you have to go and get your blood work always go to check up before and after every show. You know, which would be — which is the safer way to go.” Always Consult Your Doctor and Opt For Periodic Checkups Tom Platz: “As one of the top guys in the world, you work with a doctor like …” Paul Dillet: “Yeah. I mean, you definitely want to have someone in your corner who …” [21:15] Even back then, they're stressing the importance of cleaning out your body and coming off totally. I'm assuming he's talking about coming off totally and not cruising. Talking about getting blood work done, I guess that's what the checkup is for, I'm assuming. I don't think Saw Palmetto does much, to be honest, and milk thistle. What's going to determine if your liver is functioning correctly is your diet, your genetics, and not being on a ton of drugs. Obviously, they have a “less is more” mentality and safety first. Well, obviously not safety first, if they're walking around 300 lbs and using supraphysiological levels of androgens, but it's a lot more conservative than modern day. Paul Dillet: “… and it's anything else, you know, if you have cancer, you know, you have to have a doctor that prescribes and tell you what to take, what's the dosage, you know, or any kind of health problem. So, if you're going to do something like this, you need someone also who you're going to prescribe and someone who's going to tell you, this is too much, this is too little, and you know, point you in the right direction, instead of shooting in the dark and going and walking in the dark. And if I go into a room where there's no lights, I mean, you may make it to the other end, but then again you may like maybe bump into a coffee table, you know? So, turn on the lights to where you're going. And best to turn the lights on is, you know, go and see someone who, you know, is more knowledgeable and not some guru, you know, who say (INAUDIBLE) to a doctor.” Cycling Off For 7-8 Months Each Year Tom Platz: “During the year, is there a particular amount or number of months or weeks that you do not take steroids?” Paul Dillet: “Well, you know, I was one of the top bodybuilders and I only need to compete maybe once a year. So, I think being off stage now for several months, you know, it's been beautiful. After eight months, it's great, because no one wants to — sometimes, I think people are under the impression that, you know, you enjoy doing this. At this — at this level of the game, it's about making — you know, it's about making a buck. It's about, you know, taking care of your family, paying the bills, and people can point the finger at you. But in every professional sport, you know, you do what you got to do. When it comes down to your — you know, whether it's your family, or this, you're going to choose your family. And this is the — if this is your means of making a living, some guys don't realize that there's a life outside of bodybuilding. You know, if you have a family then you realize that. If you have a family then you're going to realize that, you know, all the consequences that can come from it. So, therefore, you want to stay off it as long as you possibly can. You know, the longer you stay on, the more — the more chance you'll have — you will harm to yourself. You know, so from me to enjoy the fact that I can stay off for, you know, seven or eight months each time.” [24:34] He's claiming he comes off and he's only on steroids for four to five months a year. I don't really know about that for somebody his size, but who am I to say. It's entirely possible that he built his foundation blasting for much longer durations than that and he can just sustain it now with less abuse now, I'm not sure though as he hasn't elaborated on that specifically. Tom Platz: “In regards to staying off that long, are there exhibitions that come on the rise during the year that — how do you handle that circumstance?” Paul Dillet: “Well, of course, (INAUDIBLE) you have — you do your appearances all year long, hopefully. But I can't let that dictate my health, you know, because you can have all the money in the world, but if you don't have your health, it doesn't mean — it doesn't mean anything. So, you know, I try to — I try my best to stay in decent condition, you know, despite doing at least still three, four days a week, half an hour cardio, still eat what I want, but watch what I — I still watch what I eat. I'm still training pretty hard, you know? There's no — there's no reason because you're not taking this — you're not taking something means that you can't go in the gym and put 100% in. Granted, you don't have the same recovery time, you just …” Tom Platz: “Without the steroids, you don't have the same recovery.” Paul Dillet: “You know, it does help you — I think you can get a lot — you can get less rest and still go back to the gym and be 100%. It helps with your joints and stuff like that. So in that sense, it does — it does do some — you know, it does — there are some benefits to it, you know, at the same time, you're not — you're not pushing it on anyone, you know?” Paul Dillet's Health Considerations Tom Platz: “So, there are definitely some health considerations you're thinking about.” Paul Dillet: Definitely. I mean, you know, I get — like I said, if you don't have a family, sometimes it can make you reckless. Now, if you have a family, it just makes you think twice. I mean, because nothing is worth — you know, nothing is worth your life. And, you know, it's unfortunate that you have people who — they do stay on all year round. They're afraid of looking a certain way when they go and make a guest appearance. I mean, if I make a guest appearance, if — like I said, I try to look the best I can, but if it's not good enough for you, then there's nothing I can do about that. Because you're still going to be hiding some — you can really appreciate once I'm on stage, but you can't — you're not really appreciating me as a person, you know, myself as a person. And how — you have to realize and say, hey …” [27:15] One thing I think that should be noted is if this is Paul Dillet, he's noticeably downsized in recent years. It's really commendable because he's talking about health and the importance of coming off and the importance of staying on top of your health. It's one thing for a bodybuilder to deal with the fact mentally that he's going to have to take what he's doing 10 steps back and take his foot off the gas and probably never gain muscle again because he can't blast high dosages anymore, but it's another thing entirely for somebody like this, who is 300 lbs lean, to have to accept mentally that they're going to literally watch all of their hard work just melt in front of their eyes over the next few years once they stop blasting these insane dosages. Actually, his dosages weren't even insane, assuming that's what he actually took. But, pounding that much food training as hard as he was, taking whatever he took, the mental fortitude that it would take for this guy to drop from where he was at in this video to where he's at now. If you don't know what he looks like now, go look at him and you'll be shocked. You would not even know that it was this guy in this video, assuming that it's actually him, of course, I don't actually know, I'm just guessing. Somebody like this, who's walking around at 300 lbs lean, is in the highest risk group of guys on the chopping block for being a bodybuilding statistic, and has a high risk of heart failure. It's always the mass monsters that are the most prone to heart disease because your body just has to work that much harder to circulate oxygen and blood around. Your heart has to support 300 pounds of lean mass. That's an insane workload to put on a body. That's why most of the bodybuilders who dropped in their 30s are the really big mass monsters. At least that's what you hear about the most, I guess. I would assert that the more muscle is on your frame, the more stress it puts on your cardiovascular system. For somebody like Paul to go from this, and then drop 100-plus pounds of muscle to become healthier, it's really commendable when you think about your family, your friends and everyone close to you. Something that should be said about that, because a lot of guys don't have the mental fortitude to allow their body to go through that downward spiral of losing everything they built over the years that their entire image is based off of. When it comes down to it, at the end of the day, do you want to live a long healthy life, or do you want to stay 300 lbs and live another 10 to 20 years maybe? A lot of the time, that's what it seems to come down to in bodybuilding, and definitely something to take note of. Paul Dillet: “… think about his health. So therefore, he can't be, I mean, in Olympia condition all year — all-year long. You know, basically should just be … You know, it's just the fact that you get an opportunity to meet these guys in person and get on stage, you know, they — they're not at their best, but at the same time, it's just you appreciate the fact that you never — you really can't see them all the time. So, maybe once in your whole life, you may get to see them right there in front of you. So, just just take it for what it is. You know, just appreciate them for that moment. You can't (INAUDIBLE) that you can't — you can't get down on it when someone says, oh, he looks like shit and you know? I look like shit but I'm happy.” [31:04] See, this is really good too, because a lot of people rag on guys who show up for guest posing when they're obviously out of shape and not diced to the socks like they are when they go on stage normally for a show. It's unrealistic to expect a bodybuilder to look in shape year-round, even if it is their job. I remember Andreas Munzer was purportedly within two weeks striking distance of being show ready year-round or something insane like that, and he was doing guest posing all the time because he had the most insane conditioning. And then, he had one of the worst deaths, unfortunately. If you actually go look at the details, it's pretty brutal about what actually caused it. At the end of it, it wasn't just heart failure. Definitely something to be noted here. Granted, I don't know if you should really accept guest posing jobs if you look bad. At the same time, you shouldn't expect a bodybuilder to look insane year-round, because it's just unrealistic. Even the most gifted guys, expecting them to look big and shredded year-round, it's unrealistic, and it's not sustainable. Paul Dillet's Take On Insulin Use Paul Dillet: “I guess I'm a happy piece of shit.” Tom Platz: “We mentioned steroids and we mentioned growth hormone, what about insulin? Is that — is insulin a drug that you believe in using?” Paul Dillet: “No, I just — in certain thing, certain places, sometimes you got to — you got to draw the line. You have to draw the line. I'm not a diabetic, I have no reason to be using insulin. [32:54] Obviously, that's not necessarily true, not that he's not a diabetic, the fact that he has no reason to be using insulin. Especially, if you're using growth hormone, you're constantly spiking your glucose levels, it could actually potentially be relieving stress on your pancreas by using insulin in conjunction with the exogenous growth hormone. Who knows what his fasting blood sugar is like, what his insulin levels are like. I can't see this guy's blood work, so I have no idea if he actually needed it or not. But, a lot of bodybuilders who use high dosages of GH, they would probably benefit from some insulin, not even in the context of trying to gain muscle, but just to prevent beta cells from burning out, and your pancreas from functioning without as much of a workload on it. Obviously, it's something to speak with your physician about and not listen to random people on the internet, but I'm just saying. Paul Dillet: “I think food to gain weight. So, therefore, I mean, you just got to eat. You know, I think sometimes it's gone a little too far, you know, where — Seems like every one is looking for a shortcut, and there shouldn't be any shortcut because only the best of the best should be here. And it shouldn't be because of drugs or anything, it should be because of hard work, dedication, sacrifice, you know, trying to have something live on. The guys before myself have worked long and hard, and made no money, you know, to get someone like myself to this point, where we actually can make a living from it, and don't have to work. I think it's sad that it's at a point now where people dying.” Tom Platz: “It is?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah, a lot of guys in the past, you know, the sport that they built they see it being in jeopardy, you know? Because of some young hothead, who just don't want to go in the gym and do the work or just don't want to diet long enough. You know, so …” Tom Platz: “You mentioned something earlier — not to take you (INAUDIBLE) this point, but it's a very interesting point. And I appreciate your sincerity and your truthfulness about how you feel about it. But you mentioned GH, you use up to 9 IUs a day.” Paul Dillet: “Right.” Tom Platz: “Does that go on for months at a time or? Paul Dillet: “I think anywhere from 4, 5 months at a time. [35:18] So, he did say 9 IUs earlier with that part. I couldn't figure out what he said. 9 IUs of GH. Paul Dillet: “You know, but …” Tom Platz: “That duration might be …” Paul Dillet: “I'd say about 10 weeks, you know.” Tom Platz: Up to the show? You don't get off prior to the show? Paul Dillet: “You get off about two weeks off from the show or a week because it doesn't — it does make you retain some fluid.” Tom Platz: “So you would stop steroids and growth?” Water-Based Steroids Paul Dillet: “You know, I would — you know, I would — you know, I personally and I would suggest also anything oil based you know, stop about three weeks out. Stick more with more water-based compounds which would be like Winstrol depot or Testosterone suspension.” [36:05] One thing I should note that I forgot to touch on earlier is it seems like these guys grow into shows. They take a long time off, assuming he's telling the truth. He's off for over seven months and then he basically gains all the size in a few months and gets shredded going into the show simultaneously. In that case, higher GH dosages meant for muscle growth make more sense as lipolysis isn't the only goal for these individuals. Granted, 9 IUs still seems pretty damn high to me. I've seen in my own blood work personally with 3 IUs of high-quality, pharma grade GH and it was at 489 ng/mL. That was only 3 IUs, so I can't even imagine what 9 would equate to. That's acromegaly levels already on 3 IUs. You can just imagine what that would do with long-term use, and probably justify the use of insulin even more so. It seems like a horrible idea to me to not use insulin alongside 9 IUs of GH. Then, he claims he dropped the GH and oil based compounds three weeks out and switches exclusively to water-based steroids. Obviously, you can see the mindset these guys have and their logic in getting rid of compounds that hold water, and introducing things that are in and out of the system quickly with the theory that it's dryer. Using DHT derivatives like water-based Winstrol and faster acting Testosterone and whatnot to not hold subq water seems pretty commonplace in this era, and even nowadays too. Paul Dillet: “Which again, anything that's water-based can also be a lot safer because it stays in your system a lot shorter. The lifespan is about 36 hours for the suspension. So, it's only in your system for 36 hours and it's out in comparison to something that's going to stay there for months. “Yeah, much longer time to do — to do damage. So, it has that much, you know …” Tom Platz: “Much longer.” Paul Dillet: You know, all those — anything that's water-based doesn't retain any fluid whatsoever, and will still keep fullness in the muscle. Yeah.” Paul Dillet's Take On Diuretic Use Tom Platz: “Okay. The next topic I'm thinking about is diuretics. Is that a part of your program as well? Paul Dillet: No, because right when I do Test and (INAUDIBLE) that's been, you know, eliminated. I think most of the time when athletes get in trouble, it's not from steroids, because, you know, from — in the past you never heard anything happen to any of the guys from back in the 70s, early 80s. You know, it's more — it's more in the 90s. You know, the new crop of bodybuilders. I think what it is, is they just took the whole diuretic thing a little too far. I know, by the fact — by the fact that the IFBB has implicated now, the drug testing that shows, I think is cut down a lot of any kind of fatality happening there, anything like, you know — so, no, there's no diuretic in the plan. And for any amateur, I would suggest leave it alone, because it does more harm than good.” Tom Platz: “So, you've never …” [39:41] That's interesting because most of the other guys are talking about using the diuretics. I can't even think of a bodybuilder off the top of my head that did get busted for diuretics in the 90's. I think Nasser did. That's all I can think of off the top of my head. I'm not even 100% sure if that's a fact or not. I don't know how heavily this rule was implemented to begin with, but it doesn't seem like it was that effective at restraining guys from using it except with Paul here, assuming it's Paul. Apparently, he didn't use any, which is interesting. Tom Platz: “Do you use diuretics prior to a show?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah. I definitely have in the past, you know?” Tom Platz: “Any problems with diuretics?” Paul Dillet: “None that I can, you know, go into. But, again, it's hard — it's hard to — when there's no one supervising, no one — no one medically monitoring, telling you, you know, how much — what's a good dosage?” Paul famously “froze” on stage from what we can only assume was diuretic use at the 1994 Arnold Classic, so I'm assuming the reason he's saying this is because he knows if he admits he had an issue, it would be incredibly easy for viewers to then put 2 and 2 together.  It was a pretty huge incident after all, and if he told the story of what happened to him it would be obvious it is him who's being interviewed. Paul Dillet: “I mean, you know, you're assuming. Now, you're cutting your fluid, you're cutting your sodium So, you don't know when you're dehydrated. I mean, everyone is dehydrated, but to what level? You know, you can be dehydrated and still fine. But to what level you're dehydrated, where it becomes severe? You know, so (INAUDIBLE) When I was using any kind of diuretic, it would be Aldactone which really is not — it's not really a diuretic. It's — all it does is cuts off your Aldosterone level, which stops you from when you get nervous, the water comes to the surface of the skin or the night before you take a (INAUDIBLE) which again, it's still — it's still a diuretic but it's still a more milder form in comparison to Lasix, you know, or anything injectable, anything like that.” [41:49] See, it's funny because this is all the exact same stuff that is parroted around today. Not necessarily saying it doesn't work, it obviously does. Dyazide the day before, having a half Dyazide the night before and Aldactone the week leading up, and Lasix is too sketchy to risk using. Aldactone I think is a terrible drug, to be honest. That's just my opinion. It's an anti-androgen use for males who want to transition to female. It's super hard to fill out on it. I've used it a couple of times, and I'm just not a fan. It strings out the physique brutally. It's kind of interesting how it's the exact same protocol being used in the 90s as a lot of gurus are giving out now, which is using Aldactone in peak week up until the day before and the Dyazide, etc. By the way, most gurus, I can't speak for all of them, but most of them don't know how to interpret hydration and kidney stress. It's incredibly risky to assume some random guru has credentials and knows what he's talking about from a health risk standpoint when it comes to diuretics. I feel like you have to know this stuff inside and out yourself, especially when it comes to diuretics. If you're just trusting some random guy to tell you how to regulate how your body is functioning and balancing electrolytes, you're literally putting potential organ failure in the hands of this person. This is stuff that you don't just leave up to chance and hope that the guy knows what he's talking about based on his track record. Go research how all of these diuretics are used yourself and their mechanism of action. This is not something to mess around with and just trust some random protocol that was designed for you from some guy that you paid $1,000 to. I have a friend that almost died from diuretic use. He was healthy, and then just like that, diuretics can literally take you from being healthy to nearly killing you in a matter of hours while you attempt to nail your conditioning for a show. Be extremely careful with diuretics, and ideally, just avoid them entirely is what I would advise. Paul Dillet's Scariest Experiences With Drugs Tom Platz: “Have you ever had a circumstance or a problematic situation which really scared you?” Paul Dillet: “Well, I've had moments, you know, where you — makes you think twice about what you're doing, you know?” Tom Platz: “For instance — without indicting yourself.” Paul Dillet: “Yes. It'd be — it'd be hard for me to do it without, you know…” Tom Platz: “Implicating yourself? Okay.” Paul Dillet: “Yeah. I mean, but it sounds like, you know, (INAUDIBLE) the hotel room and, you know, you feel — you can feel like, you know, like a tingle all over your body. But you look in the mirror, you look incredible, you know?” [45:18] One thing that I'm wondering about this whole thing is, obviously, most of the bodybuilders stayed anonymous with the exception of Lee Priest. He just blatantly went out and said whatever he wanted. I'm wondering if this actual series contributed to him getting screwed at the Olympia with his placements. I would assume the IFBB would not want their bodybuilders talking about their steroid use openly and showing their faces on camera. Especially not back then in the 90's when things like this were a lot more taboo to discuss. There are probably a lot of compounding factors, but I'm wondering if that was one of the main ones that resulted in him getting screwed over. He was screwed on some of his placements a handful of times, at least. I'm wondering if this literal series had something to do with it, which is something that just popped up in my head right now. Paul Dillet: “You look like something out of a desert, you know.  Well, that's kind of — that's the point where, you know, I think I'm in trouble, too. Because it's too — it's too much, you know, it's too dry, sort of to the point where, how much water is really in your body? You know, and then, if you start having a problem in your hotel room with cramping, what's going to happen when you go on stage, where, you know, the lights can be 120 degrees and you're being called out — call outs after call outs after call outs, you start secreting more fluid, which you don't already have. So, I mean, there's a potential right there, you know?” Paul Dillet's Annual Steroid Cycle Expense Tom Platz: “Based on some of the drugs we talked about, GH and steroids, and alike, on an estimation — your estimate — what would you estimate would be an annual expense to get ready for the — for the Olympia each year?” Paul Dillet: “$15,000.” Tom Platz: “$15,000? There are other guys who mentioned numbers of like $100,000.” Paul Dillet: “Oh, God, no. That's crazy. I mean, why the hell would you spend $100,000 to make $100,000?” [47:24] $15,000, that still seems like a lot though. Back then, think about $15,000 over 20 years ago now. I'm assuming most of that expense is put towards GH based on his dosage precontest. His steroid use is definitely not nearly that expensive. Paul Dillet: “No, I mean, I would have — I spent $20,000 and $25,000, you know? I mean, I think the crazy — you know, I think — I think I'm crazy spending $15,000, you know?” Tom Platz: “I understand.” Paul Dillet: “Because you're not guaranteed anything, you know. So, if you want to try to make — trying to make a buck when you're actually spending, you know, you have to weigh it out and ask yourself, is it worth it, you know? I mean, would I be better off keep my $15,000 on my pocket, you know? And just be a freak and guest pose and never compete. Or, you know, I mean, I see all the time. I asked myself, how did these guys survive? How did they do so many shows in a year, where I — You know, even after I spent $5,000, which if you're spending $5000, you're doing four shows a year, you know? I just can't see how it can be healthy, you know, to do four or five, six shows in one year? You know, I mean, your body is taking a punishment, it's taking a pound and, you know, burn a hundred grand?” Paul Dillet's Take On Genetics In Bodybuilding Tom Platz: “How do you account for the fact that you just mentioned, I mean, you're naturally a big man close to 300 lbs? In my day when I was competing, you're over 200 pounds, you're big. I think it's just, you know, genetics nowadays and the drugs or …?” Paul Dillet: “It's what's in the water. It's like the basketball players and, you know, football players. Just the other day I was watching a football game, I remembered saying how they'd show you 10 years ago, what the average team, what their linemen weighed and five years later their linemen, they've gained 50 lbs.” Tom Platz: “You think it's mostly genetics?” Paul Dillet: “I think a lot of it is better nutrition, better equipment. You know, it just seems like every generation, you know, things change. You know, how you (INAUDIBLE) all of these basketball players being so tall, you know? I mean …” [49:48] I think it would be naive to not mention the growth hormone and insulin use in the 90's relative to the 70's and 80's, as well as accessibility to other hormones that weren't used in the 70's and 80's. Not necessarily more efficacious or anything, but there's obviously more variety and things that didn't seem to be commonplace in the 70's that a lot of guys are getting now. In the 70's, it seemed like it was Dbol, Primobolan, stuff like that, but now you have guys using Testosterone, you have guys using GH, you have guys using insulin, you have guys using Anadrol, etc. I haven't heard any Trenbolone yet though, which is interesting. Paul Dillet: “(INAUDIBLE) now, you know, for a guy to be 6'9” (INAUDIBLE) he's a god. Back in the day, you know, a God was like 6'1″, 6'2″, 6'3″. When a guy was 6'4″, they are like, oh, he's pretty — you know?” Tom Platz: “Uh-hmm. You're right.” Paul Dillet: “Now, it's the guy is 6'9”, yeah, he's short. Like, yeah. So, it just seemed like, I mean, nothing ever stays the same in every generation. It just seemed like it keeps evolving, you know?” Tom Platz: “I think some people, you know, they view our sport, especially the guys, you know, that are up and coming, think it's genetic — it's not necessarily genetics exclusively, it's more like drugs, designer drugs, chemical warfare, and — but from your point of view, you feel it's more genetic?” [51:23] I think it's genetic and genetic response to the drugs, and denser population, leaving more genetic outliers in sheer number. That's what I think anyway. There's more genetic anomalies because of the larger population who respond insanely well to drugs with insane structures and muscle bellies and genetic response, in general. That's my take. I'm assuming he's probably going to say something similar, but we'll see. Paul Dillet: “Genetics is everything. I mean, it's either you have it or you don't. I know you've seen guys where you go in the gym and you've taken off two, three months in training, and you've dropped 30, 40 pounds. And you come back and you pass them, and they'll be at the same position. (INAUDIBLE), you know, some people have it, some people don't. I think the guys who are good with or without any drugs (INAUDIBLE) good. You know, number one, they just have — you know, they have — their heart is in it. You know, if you — if you half-ass and coming in thinking that, you know, I'm going to take drugs, and I'm going to be like one of the top guys (INAUDIBLE) you're going to be one of the scrubs, you know. With (INAUDIBLE) some people — you look at some bodybuilders and you just don't have the heart to tell them, but you don't have it. Bodybuilders are — I don't know what kind — they need glasses most bodybuilders. I know.” Diuretic Use Tom Platz: “They only test for diuretics from what I understand right now. Are there masking agents that — you don't really take diuretics?” Paul Dillet: Actually, you know what, I don't know if there's a — I think they mask it, to be honest, because I mean, I've heard some people say drink vinegar, you know, I mean … “ Tom Platz: “Yeah, we used to do that.” Paul Dillet: “I don't think they drink vinegar haha. But you're so — you're so scared that you don't want to — I mean, if you remember, in the 1996 Olympia you know, where certain athletes fail? You know, and placed second, you know, have (INAUDIBLE) who's placing them to be second, you know, in the Mr. Olympia. And to me, it's just as good as winning because of a one-point difference. You know, it doesn't mean that because those 11 people picked that one guy, Mr. Olympia doesn't mean that it shouldn't have gone the other way, you know? So, when you look at it, it makes you think, you want to be there, you know? So, it's better just to diet a little harder, do a little more cardio. I mean, come in shape. I (INAUDIBLE) I'm thinking you don't need diuretics, to be honest. I think if you're in shape, you know, you're in shape. Because I've seen guys do it. I mean, you see guys in the gym all the time.” [54:30] Obviously, I'm not a top-level guy who actually knows, but I mean, from what I've seen in my experience, it seems like it comes more down to, “do you still have fat to lose,” or “are you in shape?” Because a lot of times the diuretic use is to make up for fat loss that hasn't been accomplished yet. If you're at 5% body fat, you're dry, regardless if you take a diuretic or not. I think most of it just comes down to getting lean enough like he's saying. Paul Dillet: “where you look at just the average guy, but he's so shredded. He looks so dry, you know? This is just an average guy working out, working hard. He works at 9 — he has a 9 to 5 job, he may have a wife and kid. Well, he just come in the gym, he trains his ass off. And if he can do it, you know, why can't — why can't guys who don't work and their job is just to train, you know, what can they do? So, I mean, even if there was a mask — I mean, even if there was something to mask, I think most pros are too afraid. Too afraid to try it, you know?” Tom Platz: “Even though they were used before, or like …” Paul Dillet: “Yeah. I've heard them said it. You know, that they're afraid. You know, they don't want to go that route. They don't want to be the one that has a big scandal. You know, at the same time, they don't want to embarrass their friends and their family and themselves. So, it's — you know, the best thing is to leave it the way it is with the testing, and without the diuretics.” Esiclene And Synthol Use Tom Platz: “Continuing on the line of other agents. Is there anything you found effective like Esiclene, injecting it directly into the muscle? Any of those kinds of products?” Paul Dillet: “I've tried — I've tried the Esiclene, but …” Tom Platz: “There's some new one I think I've heard mentioned …” Paul Dillet: “Oh, yeah, everyone is big on pump and pose, or whatever you want to call Synthol. You know, again, to me, that's just too far, you know? I mean, because that's not real, you know? Bodybuilding is about — it's you, it's about you, it's about your body. It's to show how, you know, how far you can take your body, just what you can do with your body.” [56:52] What's funny about that is that's the reference to this new thing, the pump and pose, that's original Synthol, when Synthol first came out in the 90's. It's seen as this next generation, new revolutionary thing. Esiclene which is essentially obsolete now, I guess, was the popular thing back in the 90's. Tables have kind of turned it seems like. I don't know if Esiclene is still used in modern times, but I'm assuming it's a lot harder to get than it used to be because I haven't really heard of anyone using it. Paul Dillet: “The guys with calf implants, you know, how can this be bodybuilding, you know? This is like, you know, body making. It's like making the body like some kind of a sideshow, you know?” “I mean, I'd rather have 19” arms that pumps (INAUDIBLE) to 21. Tom Platz: “I know.” Paul Dillet: Because, you know, how am I going to feel? I didn't — I didn't work for this, this is not mine, you know? And some guys feel good about it, and they look in the mirror and say wow, and it's still not the same. It's not the quality — it doesn't have the quality, you know? If you look at the arms and see that, you know, it's been enhanced like something else is in there, you know, the calf. Most guys — there a lot of guys putting it in their shoulders. You know, I heard of guys put in their back, you know? And I'm like, maybe you have it or you don't. When you have to go — when you have to go to that extent, it's too far. You know, as we got something to draw the line and ask yourself, you know, are you willing to go that distance, you know? Me, personally, I'm not, you know? I mean, it's actually injecting fat into the muscle, which also can be extremely dangerous. You know, I mean, here we are, we're supposed to be so healthy and you're injecting fat in your body? So, what's that going to do? Give you high cholesterol and clogs up your artery? That's a heart attack right there, you know? I mean, there's so many things that, you know, they can give themselves a blood clot right there if they injected wrong, you know, so …” Paul Dillet On Roid Rage Tom Platz: “How about things like we read about in the magazines like roid rage and — does that really …” Paul Dillet: “I've never believed in it. (INAUDIBLE) a person, you know, I chose to do this. You know, it wasn't a means to an end. It's always what I wanted to do. So …” [59:42] I pretty much agree with that, too. If you have an aggressive personality and you lash out at people, naturally, steroids will just exacerbate that and make it worse, but if you're super chill, normally, I highly doubt steroids will make you, you know, insane. At least in my experience, it hasn't been the case. I might get a bit edgier at most, and that was even when I did what I would consider high dosages. I barely noticed a difference. I think it's more your personality type to begin with, then the hormones just exaggerate it to some extent. Paul Dillet: ” … on a diet, you know, I can't get mad at anyone, because at any moment, I can quit. I can just say, okay, that's — I don't want to do anymore. And I can walk away (INAUDIBLE) go in the gym, why am I going to have an attitude to people, you know, I grant you, you know …” Tom Platz: “I remember.” Paul Dillet: “You know? So basically, what I do when I go on the gym, I hold my head down, I put my hat on, I put my game face on, you know? And it's up to all the individuals around me to give me that respect to realize that, you know, I'm professional, I'm here to do a job. I can't come to your workplace and harass you. So, when I'm at my job, don't harass me. If you come up to me, I will tell you to leave me alone. But I don't have to be rude, I can be polite about it, you know? Or, for the guys who, you know, going off on their girlfriends, going off on their wives, and, you know, that's your routine, you know, because bodybuilding is not a team. It's not like a football game team the way you have, you know, 40 something guys on the roster. The only person that's on your team, it's either your girlfriend or your training partner, you know? Your training partner is like your wife, you know, he better be there every day, you know, he's you going to call you, he's going to wake you up, you know, and keep you from (INAUDIBLE), you know? So, how can I go nuts on these people, you know? They're the people that's in my corner. I just think roid rage is just someone who's an asshole from day one, and just have an excuse, you know, because, you know, everyone says “This will do this to you. This will do that to you.” I just think it's all you. It's (INAUDIBLE) about anything else. I have so many friends who — we're all on the same level. And I will still hang out every day and I still play — still play our games and still go out to eat and go see a movie together, hang out, and just discuss everything that we're doing, you know? Of course, when the show gets closer, anything — what happens is it become extremely quiet, you know? And that's because you're tired, you don't want to talk about, you know, talk. Or, if you want to talk, you want to talk to another athlete, you know? I mean, because he's going through the same misery, or he's been there, so he knows what you feel. But you don't want to talk to just the average individual. You know, so I don't believe in roid rage.” Paul Dillet's Advice On Steroid Use And Dosing Tom Platz: “On a closing note, is — and you've given a lot of words of wisdom and advice to our viewers in terms of their approach to the sport? Is there anything else you'd like to add to your comments already, in terms of your suggestions, in terms of drug use, or non use or …” Paul Dillet: “Well, I mean, I've never advocate using any kind of drugs whatsoever, you know, recreation or whatever. Drugs is drugs, but, you know, no matter what I say, because no matter what side he wants to side, I'm still going to do it no matter what. Only thing I could add is, you know, if you're going to do it, just keep in mind that more is not better. You know, don't just go out and pick up something and stick it in your body. You know, try to educate yourself, you know. For youngsters, you know, I think it's, you know, give you give your body a chance to grow on its own. You know, don't think that because you take it, it's gonna make you into one of the top bodybuilders. I mean, there's no guarantees that that's going to happen. So, just be careful, and the safest thing there is, you know, get a check-up. At least two check-ups a year. Get your blood work done so you know what your liver enzymes are, kidneys, prostate, there's too much (INAUDIBLE) can give you prostate cancer. So, you know, I mean, if you do this, then at least, you minimize the risk of getting hurt. I'm not saying you won't get hurt, I'm not saying you will get hurt. I mean, guys do it and walk away healthy, and you know, from (INAUDIBLE) I can just thank god it hasn't happened to myself. I pray to God (INAUDIBLE) you know, I can do this and walk away and have my health intact.” SERMs and Aromatase Inhibitors (AI's) Use Tom Platz: “Well, one thing that came to my mind just now is blocking agents and things like that, does that ever play a role in your training? Since this — we're trying to basically talk about, you know, the issues in terms of drug use and estrogen-blocking agents?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of block — there's two blocking agents. There's Nolvadex, which a lot of guys use, I've used myself. Personally, I prefer Proviron, you know, which is also another blocking agent.” [1:05:25] To clarify, “blocking agent”, I suppose is a general term. Obviously, he's talking about mitigating estrogen-related issues, which is typically accomplished via a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or an aromatase inhibitor (AI). What he just mentioned is Nolvadex which is a SERM, and Proviron which is pretty much just oral DHT, which is not a SERM whatsoever. What it does though, is when you increase your androgen index with pure DHT, you antagonize estrogen. Proviron can act as a makeshift anti-estrogen of sorts, but it's not the same mechanism of action, whereby Nolvadex selectively occupies estrogen receptors and prevents estrogen from binding. Aromatase inhibitors are what inhibits the aromatization of Testosterone, Dianabol, etc, from converting into Estrogen. There are not just two blockers, there's more than that in categories alone. They're not even mentioning AI's here. I guess we'll just see what he says. Tom Platz: “Dosage related to body weight.” Paul Dillet: “Again, the dosage — you know, for myself, I'm up to as much as 4 to 5 a day. That would be maybe two weeks after the show, you know?” Tom Platz: “I see. Two weeks …” [1:07:04] Proviron is a steroid if you didn't already know that. It's not intended as a SERM or an AI. Although, some people use it as a makeshift one. Tom Platz: ” out from?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah.” Tom Platz: “After the show.” [1:07:18] It also helps free up Testosterone bound to SHBG and can help maximize the available usable Testosterone in your body while simultaneously antagonizing some circulating estrogen. Paul Dillet: “Before.” Tom Platz: “Before the show, okay.” Paul Dillet: “Because you're trying to lower your estrogen level as much as possible. I mean, as time going on, I actually didn't use any estrogen blocker at all.” Clomid Use Tom Platz: “Is there anything you use to enhance natural secretion of pituitary in terms of testosterone after the event? Like HCG, Clomid?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah, I've used HCG, you know? And Clomid, you know, probably for about a month straight, trying to bring your own natural testosterone level back down.” Tom Platz: “And again, dosage to body weight, but your dosage (INAUDIBLE) Paul Dillet: ” … everything should always go by body weight. You know, always keep in mind that, I mean, more is not better. Also, I mean, not a subject that, you know, we should touch on is thyroids.” Cytomel (T3) Use Tom Platz: “Okay. Good point.” Paul Dillet: “You know, I mean, again, you know, thyroid is not something to be joked with, you know? Because it can leave you totally messed up (INAUDIBLE) than them.” Tom Platz: “Do you find — is that part of your program?” Paul Dillet: “Definitely, you know, personally, I like Cytomel.” Tom Platz: “Cytomel?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah, 7 weeks after the show. You know, I'll go up to as much as 100 mcg, which again …” Tom Platz: “Every day?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah. Which you don't want — you know, you do that about 7 weeks out.” [1:08:52] That's the highest dosage of T3 I've heard of a high-level guy using. Most guys avoid T3 because it's not muscle-sparing whatsoever, it's going to tear through stored fat, as well as stored muscle. Even if you're on a ton of anabolics, it's still going to tap into stored muscle protein. 100 mcg is quite a bit. Again, take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. I'm just saying anecdotally, from what I've seen, anything over 50 mcg seems to be overkill in terms of T3. Pyramid Approach To Dosages Paul Dillet: “You pyramid up, and you pyramid back down. You want to start off with one a day for at least two weeks, up to two a day, stay there for a while, up to three. The last three weeks, when you go up to four, try and get rid of any little help to help enhance get rid of any fat.” Tom Platz: “Do a pyramid approach, or regressive systems with steroids as well?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah. I mean, nothing should be stopped, cold turkey, you know? Tom Platz: “When you stop the steroids, as we've mentioned — you mentioned prior to the event …” Paul Dillet: “You pyramid down.” “So, you pyramid up then you pyramid down. Tom Platz: “You pyramid down?” Paul Dillet: “I mean, a good example would be if — what happens if you slam on the car breaks if you're going 90 miles an hour? And you jam on your car breaks, you know, you may fly through the window as a possibility. It may stop, you may be okay. So, it's the same thing with the steroids, you could — you're going 90 miles an hour, where you're taking this, you're taking that, you're taking these high doses, and out of the blue you just stop.” [1:10:38] Now, obviously, a lot of you guys aren't going to agree with what he's saying here. Logically, it would make sense why, but you have to keep in mind that in the 90s, there's no rhyme or reason to a lot of this stuff. It was just based on what other guys are doing and what seemed to be the correct way to go about things. I probably would have logically thought what he's saying right there too, in the 90's. Ultimately, suppressing your hormone production past the point when your cycle should be ending just for the sake of titrating down, it doesn't necessarily make sense, in my opinion. You're just prolonging your recovery period just for the sake of tapering down when you're suppressed regardless if you're on 50 mg of exogenous Testosterone or 500 mg of exogenous Testosterone. Personally, I would just try clear all the exogenous suppressive hormones out of my system as fast as possible so then I could get into PCT as quick as possible to recover homeostasis and natural function. Paul Dillet: “You know, so it's better gradually, gradually let your body adapt to the — let you body adjust to what you're doing.” Paul Dillet's Highest Dosage Of Steroids Per Week He Would Use Tom Platz: “Is there a certain weekly — you may have already mentioned this already, is there a certain weekly milligram total of steroids you would look at in terms of being a high dosage for you, as you pyramid up and pyramid down?” Paul Dillet: “A high doses would be 600 mg of Testosterone, 600 mg of Deca, 2 Anadrols, and 9 IUs of GH.” Tom Platz: “The highest level?” Paul Dillet: “That's my — that's my highest level.” Tom Platz: “I see. And prior to that, you would work up to that and work down?” Paul Dillet: “I work up to that and I work myself back down.” [1:12:33] It's sort of tackling the Myostatin issue right there, because he titrates up, which I didn't really realize earlier when he was talking about it. I don't know if he made it clear or not. He starts low and then his Myostatin level elevates to inhibit and prevent further muscle growth, the dosage gets titrated up more and so on and so forth throughout the entirety of the cycle it sounds like, which makes more sense for his goals. While contradictory to what he's said, he claims his total dosage per week at his peak comprised of 600 mg Testosterone per week, 600 mg Deca, and then he was taking 50 to 100 mg Anadrol, which on the high end would be 700 mg a week of Anadrol. That's 1900 mg, so that's almost 2 grams of steroids total per week, which is a lot less than a lot of people think these guys are using. If you factor in the Proviron, which is technically a steroid, he would be clearing 2 grams per week, but it's still a lot less than many guys are abusing even at a regional level. 9 IUs of pharma GH is quite a bit in contrast to what I was expecting to hear him say though. Paul Dillet: “And then, like I said, for my personal thing, I’d rather do, you know, four different things together.  You know, because sometimes certain things interact better.  One thing makes the other thing (INAUDIBLE), it's like growth hormone and testosterone, testosterone with Anadrol, you know, everything helps the next one that bit more. So, cramming tons of it all at once, again, let your body utilize it, you know, gradually. Then it works more efficiently (INAUDIBLE) you'll find that it’ll be a lot safer, you'll get more out of it, because once — when you put too much on your body, it's like trying to — you're trying to study for a test and you try to cram it all in one night, you know, you can't do it.  You forget all about it, so you're like, you get frustrated. You know, it's the same thing with your body, you're trying to cram too many things in, it'll shut your body down. [1:14:37] That's a good analogy. Paul Dillet: “It'll be a little today, a little tomorrow, a little the next day.  Gradually, it'll all come to you. Same thing with that if you put in a little in today, a little in tomorrow, you know, gradually, step by step, you'll get what you're looking for without (INAUDIBLE) towards just messing yourself up.” Paul Dillet's Macros Tom Platz: “In regards to amount of calories you eat a day, and protein, carbohydrate, fat ratios, I mean, is there a system you follow?” Paul Dillet: “You know, I was — I always tell people, believe it or not, there is some method to all this madness. And sometimes it (INAUDIBLE) like I said madness because sometimes when you think about this, it doesn't sound logic, you know? I mean, in the off — you know, in the offseason which would be when you're not concentrating on a show or anything, I don't usually think about what I'm eating. I don't think about the calories or protein or anything like that, but in preparation for a show, then, yes, I do concentrate on the amount of protein and fats, carbohydrate I take in.” Tom Platz: “What's it like before when you're thinking about a show, what would be the caloric intake per day?” Paul Dillet: “About 4,000. You know, 4,000 calories a day.” Tom Platz: “And then, as far as protein?” Paul Dillet: “Which should be consistent.  Chicken, you know, baked turkey. Again, mixed in my protein. So, I'm eating protein from all — from different …” Tom Platz: “Different sources?” Paul Dillet: “Yes, source of food groups. Carbohydrate…” Tom Platz: “How many grams of protein a day?” Paul Dillet: “Anywhere from 450 to 600.” Tom Platz: “Wow.” [1:16:22] Jeez. So, 4,000 calories a day at the start of a prep, and 450 to 600 grams of protein. That's actually kind of what I expected, to be honest. A lot of guys think that the pros eat a ton, but I think the reality is that they just grow off of what many would consider fairly normal surplus amounts. The reality is, they probably do the same thing as you and I. They just respond 100 times better. If you can get shredded eating 2500 calories, 2400 calories, which is a pretty common number to get down to when you're prepping for a show. Titrating back up, do you really need to jump straight up to 5,000 calories to grow? Maybe in a few months once you've plateaued 50 times on your way there, but when you start and you're just trying to grow, I think 4,000 seems pretty reasonable, granted this guy is like 300 lbs. I don't know if he has to increase it eventually or what, but I think it's grossly exaggerated what a lot of people think these pros are eating to grow. I think most of them are probably eating 4,000 to 5,000 calories to grow. Paul Dillet: “You keep the carbohydrate low, though. Carbohydrate would be about anywhere from 100 to maybe 200 a day.” Tom Platz: “That’s prior to an event.” Paul Dillet: “Yeah.” Tom Platz: “The offseason?” Paul Dillet: “I didn’t care, you know? The carbohydrate will be very low.” Tom Platz: “How about the fat intake?” Paul Dillet: “You keep your fat intake — you do eat fats, maybe at all food groups. You need fats, you need the carbs, you need the protein for them to work in conjunction together.” Tom Platz: “Any idea of how many grams?” Paul Dillet: “Probably — let’s say about 75 grams of fats to 100 grams of fats.” Tom Platz: “Very high protein, low carbohydrate sort of diet you follow.” Paul Dillet: “Yeah. High protein, low carbs, moderate amount of fats.” [1:18:20] He's claiming he doesn't even monitor his diet in the offseason, which is seven months of the year. Then for five months, he's on point and he's having 100 to 200 grams of carbs and 450 to 600 grams protein, which is interesting because most guys who have a ton of muscle are slamming a lot more carbs. That seems pretty low and kind of insane to me to be honest because the theory is that carbs are muscle sparing, so you increase your carb intake when you're trying to gain muscle and lower your protein intake, so you can handle more carbs, because obviously, you don't need as much protein when your carbs are super high. It's interesting to hear his protein cranked up to 600 and then having a low carb approach. I thought it would have been a more middle ground, but apparently not. Paul Dillet: “But your body does need, you know, for lubricant for the joints, the internal organs, and all these things, you know? Supplements Over The Counter That Actually Work Tom Platz: “Another point I wanted to address with you would be so many times in the magazines, we see a lot of top bodybuilders endorsing — I don't want to mention names but endorsing this product and this product is the magic substance or the solution to, you know, steroids and real — (INAUDIBLE) real drugs, the word, nutraceuticals comes into play.  I mean, are there nutrient type situations or compounds or nutraceuticals that really do work? What do you think about that?” Paul Dillet: “There’s some (INAUDIBLE) there's a lot of products, I mean, that do work.  I think (INAUDIBLE) couple years back, maybe 15 years ago, 20 years ago, nutrition wasn't as good as it is right now. But, I mean, I'm a firm believer in, you know, protein supporting drinks, you know, I mean, you have a lot of athletes who don't have the appetites the way they — the way they get their calories in, or their proteins, but, you know, the protein supplements, you know, whether it's in a package or, you know, in a container, whichever way you do it.  And of course, you do need vitamins, minerals, all these different things, anti-oxidizing things …” Tom Platz: “Anti-oxidants?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah, to flush out the body. I mean, B vitamin is one of the best vitamins, you know, you can get. Then, combined with your vitamin C. So, there's a lot of products out there. There are some products that I really don't know too much about, you know, because I never stopped to take the time to educate myself on it because I don't think it's something that is a 100% must for me.  But I do believe that multi-mineral vitamin B complex, you know, (INAUDIBLE)” Tom Platz: “Basics?” Paul Dillet: “Yeah. I do believe 100% in all the basics, you know, chromium, all these — all the things that were there 20 years ago, but are still here right now. Only it's just been enhanced this much better. The technology is so much better. I totally believe in those 100%.” Tom Platz: “Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it.” Conclusion On Paul Dillet's Steroid Cycle After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Paul Dillet's steroid cycle dosages in the offseason and pre-contest, he claims his use broke down to the following: Offseason: Testosterone Cypionate – 400-600 mg per week Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca) – 400-600 mg per week Anadrol – 50-100 mg per day Contest Prep: Testosterone Propionate – 500-600 mg per week Primobolan – 500-600 mg per week Anadrol – 50-100 mg per day GH (growth hormone) – 9 IUs per day Proviron – 4-5 pills per day Cytomel – Titrating up to 100 mcg per day Calories, Protein, Carbohydrate, And Fat Intake Precontest: Calories – 4000 cal per day Protein – 450-600 grams per day Carbs – 100-200 grams per day Fats – 75-100 grams per day [1:21:33] Paul's dosages weren't crazy high. His GH use was moderately high, but the anabolics themselves didn't pass 2-3 grams at his peak apparently. No insulin use, and overall his use is a lot more moderate than you would expect from a guy who's easily considered one of the biggest mass monsters of the 90’s.

    "content": "Reacting To And Analyzing Lee Priest’s Steroid Cycle In The 90’s     This interview discussing Lee Priest's steroid cycle was recorded by Tom Platz in the 90's. This will give an inside look into what top pros with top 0.0001% genetics were doing in the 90's to achieve their physiques. Obviously he could be lying, but I don't see any reason for him to lie, other than to downplay how much of an abuser he could come across as. These interviews were supposed to be anonymous, but Lee was the only bodybuilder who opted to be completely transparent and not have his face blurred out or his voice changed in post-production to hide who he is. I personally think that he's probably telling the truth. But, you guys can be the judge, and I'll just comment along the way.

It's more like a personal choice because I'd won a few national titles beforehand, and then a few shows. And then, as the level got harder, the guys were getting bigger. So, it came down to more of a should or should not, I'll just do it for an experiment. I just decided to give it a go, take a small dosage, see how it affected me. So, it wasn't like a had to because I was winning shows anyway without them beforehand. And I trained for like five or six years before I've even done my first course on steroids. So, it's like one of those things after competing in such a high level. I just want to go ahead and give it a go and see how they worked.” What Age Did Lee Priest Start Using Steroids? Tom Platz: “You mentioned you were competing five or six years before you took steroids. So, how old were you when you first started taking steroids?” Lee Priest: “I was 19.” Tom Platz: “19? Since we're …” [2:10] See a lot of guys think he started way younger than that. Many think he started at 16 years old. It's interesting to hear him say he started at 19. I don't know if it's truthful or not. This is what Lee looked like at only 16 years old.  I see no reason why he would lie though, other than the obvious trying to downplay his usage. To me, Lee doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would lie about his use. He's very short, so he can pack on size much easier than a taller bodybuilder. Five pounds on him is going to look like 20 pounds on a really tall guy. Is it completely unorthodox to think that somebody could have looked the way he did at 16 naturally? Honestly, I have no idea because I have nowhere near the genetics of this guy, so I'm not really sure. Only Lee knows for sure. The Steroids Lee Priest Chose To Use Tom Platz: “So, we're speaking about steroids at this point.  What specific steroids do you find effective in your training?” Lee Priest: “I've always stuck to the basic like Deca. It was the very first one I used when I was 19, and put on 20 pounds and did a six-week course on it.  That's all I used like 2 cc's a week.  And then I put on 20 pounds.  Yeah, sure, there's some water weight.” [3:21] I guess depending on the concentration of Deca at the time, maybe Lee took anywhere from 200 to 600 mg a week, approximately. Obviously, quantifying in cc's isn't a way of measuring actual dosages as concentrations could vary product to product depending on how the company producing it decided to dose it. I'm assuming these guys were using mostly pharma-grade steroids back then, or most of it was probably more so pharma than UGL. I don't really know to be honest, but it could be anywhere from 100 mg/mL up to 300 mg/mL. Just an educated guess, I'm going to say he's probably taking either 200 or 400 mg a week in this cycle reference. Lee Priest: “But then, even now, I stick to the basics like Deca, Primobolan.  I don't like Testosterone also, I stay away from Testosterones, but just the basics like that.  So, I've never really delved into the science.  You have some guys like stacking six or seven (INAUDIBLE) always do.” [4:20] The interesting thing about that, he's talking about how he likes Nandrolone, which is a 19-nor, and then you have Primobolan, a DHT derivative. And he doesn't have any Androstane in his preferable cycle whatsoever. He has nothing that's aromatizing heavily into estrogen. Lee Priest's Steroid Dosages Tom Platz: “Like in terms of some of the drugs you just mentioned, steroids.  You just mentioned specific dosages.  Could you give us some idea of what specific dosages you use prior to a show and how long you use these dosages?” Lee Priest: “Getting ready for a contest, I normally start dialing 12 weeks out.  So, I'll start with maybe like Stanozolol which is the same as Winstrol.  I'll take like two cc's every three days.  Then sometimes, I get sick of taking it or somewhat increased it to every four or five days, because I hate being a pin cushion.  Now, I'm taking one Anadrol 50 a day because like they're one — the worst on your liver, so I hate using them, but for keeping the size and strength, they're good, but I take one a day of them. And then, I was taking two IUs of growth hormone every day for the last six weeks.  And then just Nolvadex.” Tom Platz: “Okay.” [5:31] To a lot of people, this cycle probably makes no sense. But back in the day, you have to understand there's no internet, there's no cycle theory, there's nothing really, except for a few random underground encyclopedias of bodybuilding. He's talking about using injectable Winstrol every three days when it has a half-life of 24 hours. And then, 50 mg of Anadrol per day and two IUs of GH, which is not a significant amount. If you're using pharma, that might put you at maybe a 300-350 ng/mL IGF-1, which isn't that far out of range. It's not crazy high or anything. And then he's talking about Nolvadex here, which I'm assuming he just uses to antagonize estrogen at the receptor to dry out a bit before a show. Lee Priest: “Just about all getting ready for a contest.” Deca and Primobolan Use During The Offseason Tom Platz: “Okay. So, how about in the offseason then? Would you take anything?” Lee Priest: “Off-season, I don't use too much. It's more like I rely more on food and heavy training. I normally go like maybe 5 months before I do another course in the offseason.  Now, I just take the basics like Deca, 2 cc's of Deca, 2 cc's of Primobolan for 8 weeks, then I go off of it for another three months before I do something else.  I've never really been a big believer like in, you know, people get the mentality where you need steroids — to grow you need steroids. If you get that in your mentality then …” [6:57] For growth phase, I guess he only uses around 200 – 400 mg of Deca and 200 mg of Primo. It's kind of hard to tell based on varying concentrations. I have no idea what the concentration is of what he's using, so when he refers to CC's, I'm just going to assume based on what most of those products are dosed at per milliliter. Lee Priest: “But I might just use these like an assistance rather than rely on them. That's why at contest time, I might take a little bit more because I'm doing more training, I'm doing more cardio. So, like, even dieting, you cut your food back so recovery is much harder. So the drugs might have helped me more for recovery than anything.” How Many Weeks Away From A Contest Does Lee Priest Start Contest Prep Tom Platz: “Is there a certain time during the year — I know you mentioned it was four week — four months prior to a show you start getting ready?” Lee Priest: “Normally three to four months before a contest I'll start preparing.  And then I'll start — as soon as I start my diet, I start restricting the food.  I'll just start on one steroid like Stanozolol. Retain the size and strength while I cut back the calories.  Then, maybe like six weeks before the show, that's when I start up the growth hormone.  Then, like 8 weeks, I put the Anadrol in, 8 weeks before the show.  I just start — I don't take them all at once from the beginning.  I just slowly start on one then increase the other.  As the show gets nearer, I start tapering off them again.” Tom Platz: “It brings up a point prior to the show.” [8:19] His pre-contest stack is more or less based on Winstrol. I guess injectable Winstrol, which is obviously far more efficacious than oral, at least in practical application from what I've seen. 50 mg of Anadrol. I don't know if he's titrating up or what the deal is. It's kind of ambiguous here, but it sounds like pretty mild doses of Winstrol, Anadrol, and a couple IUs of GH. That's nothing crazy whatsoever compared to what most guys are doing. Tom Platz: “Do you stop taking steroids completely at certain point or do you continue steroids through the show?” Lee Priest: “Normally, a week or two before I'll stop them.  I'm just so sick at taking them anyway because I really feel sometimes my stomach feels sick when I'm on them. And I can't sleep sometimes, so I always look forward to stop taking the needles.  So, as soon as — the sooner, the better for me if the show comes close.  I just can't wait to get off them. So, normally like a week or two before I'll stop them altogether.” Tom Platz: “Depending upon the number of shows, I guess, you enter per year will determine how long you're on steroids for that — for that year.  Is there any specific time you don't take steroids or number of months, weeks that you don't take steroids at all during the year?” Lee Priest: “Normally, if I — when I do my contest, I try to group them more together, so the shows are pretty close together.  But then like after a show, like a big show I did last year, I didn't touch them again for seven months.  I just went totally off them.  Had maybe a shot of Deca twice because I had sore elbows.  So maybe for the joints I took two shots of Deca, but that was about it for the whole seven months.” Tom Platz: “So, your dosages are actually quite low…” [9:51] He makes probably anyone feel like a drug abuser. Because his doses are so mild, I don't know if he's telling the truth for sure. Again, I see no reason why he would make this up. I don't think he really cares, to be honest. Tom Platz: “…compared to what I think people think about” Lee Priest: “I've read magazines where they say, you know, guys use — professionals use these large amounts.  And we just sit down and we laugh about it, you know, we read it, you know, we spend $40,000 a year $50,000 to get ready for a contest.  People say we're dumb, but we're not that stupid.  It's like, if the prize money is $10,000, who's going to spend $50,000 to get ready for a contest?” Tom Platz: “Yeah, I'm thinking one of the guys I was talking to earlier mentioned that, you know, at times it can be from $15,000 up to even $100,000 a year, and it's — you don't do anything like that?” Lee Priest: “I can take my past experience, I did a big contest.  I didn't spend any more than $2,000.  And it's only because I started using a bit of growth hormone. I've never used it prior to a few years ago, but before then, I wasn't spending more than $600 to get ready for show.” Lee Priest's Take On Growth Hormone Tom Platz: “Do you find the growth hormone to be the magic substance that it's touted to be?” Lee Priest: “Not really.  It's like people say it's a wonder drug, but before I started using, I came in great shape, I came in hard and full. I've started using — I'm not sure whether because I'm growing too each year.  Each year I'm like 10 pounds heavier.  So, I was like whether, you know, when contest time comes, I come in shape without it, and I come in shape using it.  So, whether it just adds to help keep that size, I'm not sure.  It's hard to say because when you're using the growth, you're using other ones with it.  So, it's hard to say whether the growth is doing anything.  I'd like to take the growth by itself to see whether it did anything or not because if you've been mixing drugs it's hard to say what's working, what isn't working, so …” Tom Platz: “True. Have you taken it by itself?” Lee Priest: “No, I haven't, so …” Lee Priest's Take On Insulin Use Tom Platz: “How about insulin, is that something that goes along with GH?” Lee Priest: I've never — I've never tried.  I know a lot of guys that do, but to me, you know, I spoke to a doctor before and he says, for the small difference it makes, it's not worth the risk of becoming a diabetic.  Some people take too much, go into comas.  So, for me, like the risk of that it's not worth it, so I've never really messed around with insulin.” [12:04] To me, this is so indicative of somebody who just has insane genetics. He somewhat knows what he's talking about, obviously. Who am I to critique what he's saying. Just the way he describes the mechanism of action of drugs and what would happen if you took insulin and what not, it's pretty obvious that Lee is just a hyper-responder to whatever he takes. Obviously, he's very cautious as well. I mean, everyone's knowledge was pretty limited I would assume in the 90's about what these compounds actually do. The fact that he barely touched GH, hadn't messed with insulin, low doses of gear, this guy was pretty much running baby cycles year-round and he was still massive. It just goes to show the importance of genetics. I've done a video on this before about not taking advice from guys with top tier genetics. It's because of stuff like this because if a guy who responds to this is going to try and get a guy with average genetics to grow, it's probably not going to work out because his knowledge is limited to the scope of just insane hyper responding to everything that he does. Lee Priest's Scariest Experience With Steroids Tom Platz: “Well, did you have any scary episodes with things you may have taken?” Lee Priest: “One time I bought some contaminated stuff, you know. Of course, when you're being pushed to the black market, you'll get guys out there who'll bottle anything to sell their steroids had some sort of — it was contaminated and got blood poisoning, so I sort of in bed for week and couldn't walk …” [13:38] Ok, so he does buy underground UGL stuff. Obviously, I wasn't around in the 90's to see what the UGL scene was like, but evidently there were cases where guys were getting contaminated product and whatnot, which means they weren't just exclusively using pharma grade gear. Lee Priest: “And I had to get antibiotic, get shots for that.  So, stuff like that sort of makes you scared if you're buying stuff off the black market or stuff from different people. Of course, it can be anything. They'd be — could be selling cooking oil for all you know. All the stuff could be put together in someone's dirty room. So, stuff like that always scares you because it can — it does happen.  There was a case a couple of years ago, a guy died because he thought he was using growth hormone, but it was actually insulin. Someone (INAUDIBLE) too much (INAUDIBLE) went into a coma and died. So, people do anything to make money these days, so it's always scary.” Tom Platz: “I guess you need to be careful upon where your sources …” Lee Priest: “Exactly. So, the new stuff I got came from a friend, so …” But he could get off somebody else, so it's always a risk you take, I guess, when you do any sport, really, so …  And whether you're a car driver, whenever you're going to hop into a car and race around and get killed.  It's luck of the draw, sometimes it's going to be bad, sometimes it'll be good, but if you get the bad stuff, you know, it can kill you straight away.” Lee Priest's Outlook On Steroid Use In Sports Tom Platz: “I mean, other than getting impure products or bogus products or counterfeit products, are there anything — how do you feel about the whole sport, in general, as far as the steroid issue? Is it something you wish wasn't there or it's there and you just tolerate?” Lee Priest: “Sometimes you wish it wasn't there, but it's like for any sport, it's going to be there, so sometimes bodybuilding is like the poster child for steroid use.  You know, footballers use it, you know, the Chinese swim team use it.  Like, any sport you go, everyone use it, just (INAUDIBLE) looks at differently.  We get pointed at the most as being the users because, you know, most people that use steroids don't look like us, they're like, well, they must be using more, they must be taking more.  And I was like, I say it's hard, just accept it.  You know, you've got a choice, if you don't want to use it, you don't have to use it.  And there are shows out there to compete and we don't have to use it, but if you're good enough without it, you can compete with guys that use it.  Well, more luck to you, so … (INAUDIBLE) have a little preference, you know, you can tell people the bad effects and tell them the good effects. It's like drinking or smoking, you got to make your own choice whether you want to use it or not, you know?  Apparently, I don't want you ever touching it, yet the people go and use it anyway. It comes down to personal preference and if you want to try it, you can.  If not, well, don't do it.” Lee Priest's Take On Diuretic Use And Warnings Tom Platz: “How about other items or drugs like diuretics. Is it something that you feel works in terms of bodybuilding application?” Lee Priest: “I think they do work because, you know, get a little bit of water you got left, but been through there's so many like Lasix I tried and I felt like near death trying Lasix.  It just like took everything out of me.  But there are some other ones out where you can use and which spares potassium which I find work well.  Even now they got natural herbal diuretics I've experimented with, and the herbal ones sometimes were just as good.  Sure, not exactly as great but yet they do the same job without serious side effects, you know, where you drain all the minerals out of your body because you're at a fine state your body fat is down.  You haven't got no minerals left in your body and you just drain everything out.  That's what a lot of deaths come from because you just drain everything out and you have a heart attack or just shut down.” [19:07] It's definitely true. Anytime I've seen a freak accident in bodybuilding, through personal friends or just through the grapevine, people in the local bodybuilding circuit, in terms of a dire health situation, it's been either accumulation of steroid use over the course of several decades or several years that leads to cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart attack, etc. or diuretic use leading to immediate consequences. The only time where a healthy bodybuilder ends up dying that I've personally seen is through diuretic misuse. That's why you have to be really careful about who you get as a coach and just taking advice from random people on the internet, or taking advice from random coaches. You have no idea if they really know what they're doing or not. I don't even really have advice for how to go about finding somebody credible or not, other than getting a coach vetted to you through people you trust in your social circle. When it comes to diuretic use, a close friend of mine actually had a heart attack and near renal failure from diuretic misuse pre-contest, and he's my age. He was sent to the hospital and almost died, and he was only 25 years old. You have to be really careful about that stuff because you can easily accidentally throw off your electrolyte balance and end up in the hospital. You're just taking shots in the dark, thinking you know how to pull water and fill out, and dry out and harden up. It's so easy to throw everything off and send yourself to the ER, so be really careful about that stuff. What he just said where the herbal stuff over the counter works really well, too, yeah, things like dandelion root work. If you're lean enough for a show, you shouldn't need Lasix or something. Obviously at a top bodybuilding level, I have no idea, to be honest. Just from what I've seen, unless you're competing at a super high level, I don't think you need to be messing with things like Lasix, Aldactone, and other diuretics that are just too risky to mess with, unless you 100% know what you're doing. Diuretic Dosages Tom Platz: “What kind of dosages have you taken on some of the diuretics in terms of the …” Lee Priest: “The diuretics? I've used like the Aldactone or Aldactazide.  I just take like half a one maybe two days before a show.  I think maybe 20 mg and the night before a show, I take a whole one.  You don't really need high amounts of diuretics to work.  Just so you know, if you're coming back, you're …” [22:10] Aldactone is one of the worst diuretics you could use in my opinion by the way. It's used as an anti-androgen for men who are transitioning from male to female, and it's just poor. I don't think that it's very effective pre-contest. It usually just flattens guys out and prevents them from filling back up by messing with aldosterone and re-uptake of everything. The only thing that I've seen work well that wasn't too risky to mess with is a low dose of Dyazide, personally. Ideally, you would just get lean enough, and you don't even need to use diuretic at all. But obviously at a high level, there's things these guys are doing that I guess is a necessity for them to show up the way they need to, but the likelihood that you need to even touch a diuretic ever is very low. Be careful with them because those are the things that are going to kill you instantly. Lee Priest: “… three or four days before a show, and then you take it, excuse me, that might drain everything you've got.  But I always keep my fluid high.” Tom Platz: “Regarding diuretics, it's — so, sometimes you use herbals, and sometimes you would use the Aldactone or the Aldactazide? But it seems like — from what I hear, you're saying, it's like you use very little amounts of all the — including esoteric drugs.” Lee Priest's Advice On Starting Steroids Using Low Dosages Lee Priest: Yes. I've always been since I started I've always used small amounts.  I found a small amount work, you know.  Once — one time, I did try a large amount and it made no difference than the small amount.  So ever since then, I've always just stuck to small amounts.  Because, once you start using large amounts, it's going to benefit the guy who's selling it to you because he's making more money because you're using it quicker.  But yet, you know, 2 cc's to me works just as good as what 10 cc's does.” [23:53] For somebody competing at the Olympia level, for him to say this kind of stuff, it should be really enlightening for a lot of guys watching this. Because, you get into this mindset when you're trying to become a good bodybuilder that, “Okay, I've built muscle at this dosage, so next cycle I have to do more to keep building muscle.” It's not always necessarily the case. Myostatin works in a regulatory way, so that if you're always on the same dose, then your body is going to have a feedback mechanism of Myostatin to prevent you from gaining more. And then, that puts you in a position where you probably do need to use more to continue gaining, but if you're going up and down, and you're not just doing a perma-blast, trying to perma-bulk for two years straight, the likelihood is you can probably get away with a lot less than you think. I fell into this trap when I was younger, thinking I need at least 500 mg of Testosterone in every cycle or else I won't grow. You'd be surprised how little you can probably get away with, and that is the exact reason why I regret what I used for my first steroid cycle. Lee Priest definitely has more muscle than you, I'm assuming, definitely a significant amount more than me. I was using doses higher than he was back when I was at my peak of usage. Did I need it?  No, definitely not, especially, for what I was trying to do. I've actually noticed that, too. Even with my TRT, at first, I was on 200 mg a week. And then I wanted to see how low I could get it for health reasons. I started tapering down. Muscle didn't fall off me though and I kept tapering down, and nothing changed. I still held onto my muscle mass. You'd be surprised that even half of what you're taking could probably accomplish the exact same thing. It'll probably have you feeling less toxic, have better blood markers, and actually increase your longevity in the sport too. Lee Priest: ” Some people get the impression (INAUDIBLE) if I'm taking 2 cc's and I gained 20 pounds, you know, 60 cc's I'll gain, you know, twice as much, three times the amount, you know, the more I take, but it doesn't work that way.” Tom Platz: “Well, based upon the fact you take small amounts, would this be a suggestion? Not that we're in this — with this particular video, or are we making suggestions or recommendations for drug use at all.  We're really confronting the issues.  But in terms of the viewers and the younger people coming up, younger guys and coming up, listening to this, your basic thoughts would be less is more.” The “Secret” To Lee Priest's PED Use Lee Priest: “Yes, I've always found (INAUDIBLE) everyone I speak to, I tell him that, but yet, some people have in their mind that they need large amounts because so many people tell them.  You know, the pros take this, they take that much, but yet, the pros don't.  Nearly amateur I've met takes twice the amount as a pro does, but because we're bigger than they are, say they had taken 1500 mg and we're bigger, they're thinking the pros aretaking 3000 mg.  But yet, as I said, I take maybe 200 mg of Deca, 200 milligrams of Primobolan per week.  I get good results from that, so you don't need large amounts.” Lee Priest: “… a little bit on drugs which I'm going to use and spend the rest of money on food because, you know, the food is gonna work, so just train heavy on that.  But, you know, people want to get a quick fix straightaway, they want to get huge overnight.  But bodybuilding — building muscle takes years.  I'd recommend training, you know, five to six years before you even decide to use steroids.  [27:43] One thing he just mentioned, too, that is worth noting that I've noticed as well is, I used to always think, oh, the pros are doing something different, they're taking Increlex or they're taking some secret thing, or they're taking more than everyone else. But the fact is, a lot of the amateurs are actually taking more than the pros, and the reason is that their genetic response is so terrible, which is why they're stuck at regional level shows, not even winning overalls. They're using upwards of four, five, even six grams of steroids a week. Genetics And Steroid Abuse In Bodybuilding Then there are pros using less than a quarter of that and getting pro cards because of genetics. That's just what it comes down to. The amateurs think there's a secret, and they think the secret is more, and more, and more. Whereas the pros, they're getting exactly where they want without even having to get to that point yet. I think it's actually pretty common, amateurs using more than pros, if not, maybe the same amount, or maybe in some cases, pros more obviously. There are obviously health-conscious amateurs who don't do that, but it's actually a pretty common scenario to have amateurs who are way overdoing it, thinking they just need to keep pushing the envelope to finally get that pro-size that they just can't get. It's not the case, they're just chasing a pipe dream, it's never going to happen if their genetics are inferior. Lee Priest: “It's like it's one of those things.  You got to build a foundation first, and then maybe if you want experiment and try them, you know, go ahead, but, you know, don't go crazy, thinking you're going to get big overnight and take large amounts, because you'll probably end up sick or dead.  You know, it's not going to make you any bigger taking a large quantity.” Tom Platz: “So you wouldn't — you're not suggesting or are you, that steroids are magic … “ Lee Priest: “Far from it. (INAUDIBLE) the genetics, if you don't have the willpower or determination upstairs, you can take all the drugs you want, you're never going to get anywhere, you know.  The guys who are champions today, any sport would be there without drugs. You know, like, Ben Johnson, he still would have won the race without steroids.  It's like — he was using Stanozolol.  Like, I use Stanozolol before a contest.  I probably took more than him, but yet I could never beat him in a race. The drug, certainly, make him run fast.  It's like, anyone (INAUDIBLE) look at bottles, like a bottle of stanozolol you see for animals, horses.  Now a horse, that's like 800 pounds more, takes 2 cc's every two weeks.  So, I was like, bodybuilders getting ready for shows would sometimes take 2 cc's every two days and I'm thinking like, humans that weigh, you know, 200 pounds, what are we taking two mls every two days for … “ [30:09] That kind of goes back to my video I did on Trenbolone where I discussed the dosage used in cattle to beef them up and compared it to the dosages guys are using for bodybuilding purposes that barely weigh 185 pounds, and that just ties it in perfectly. You have guys using doses approved for vet usage in animals 10 times your size, using doses 10 times higher than the horses or the cattle are using. That's a very logical way to put it, in my opinion, and it makes a lot of sense. Lee Priest: “Probably needs, you know, 2 mls every two weeks, you know, it just comes down to common sense. So … “ Lee Priest's Take On Testing For Diuretic Use In The 90's Tom Platz: “I understand that the current shows are only tested in terms of diuretics.  Are there — how'd you get around that, are there masking agents or … “ Lee Priest: “(INAUDIBLE) I start taking the herbal diuretics you can take it, it'll be out of your system in six hours.  So, there's always going to be a masking agent.  Then masking agents too can add to the danger, because people take more stuff to try and cover up what they're taking which can have a counteract or, you know, not mix well.  Some of the counteragents can be more dangerous than the steroids themselves.  So, even with the diuretics, you stick to the herbal ones you can do okay.  (INAUDIBLE) diuretics that you can take the night before and the next morning, you can be clean, so…” Tom Platz: “And there's no trace of taking diuretic?  I see.  How about other esoteric drugs, like Esiclene or what …?” Esiclene Use In The 90's Lee Priest: “I've tried to Esiclene like in the offseason once just to see what it did.  And, you know, I heard a lot, I've been training properly with it.  So, you know, it swells the muscle up and inflamed the muscle red.   So I'm thinking, what's the point, you know – for the little bit of improvement it gives you.  It's not worth it then a couple of days later, it goes away.  So, for a contest, people like to use it, you know, to put a little bit more height on their bicep or in their calf.  But it covers up all the definition.  It's like, to me, it's like, if you go on stage and you're more defined, it's all an illusion on stage, you're going to look bigger anyway. [32:11] Esiclene something it's not really talked about in the modern day. I don't know if it's totally obsolete or if it's still used in top bodybuilding competitions or not. Basically, what it does is after it's pinned, it inflames the muscle from the inside and artificially creates a swollen look that can enhance lagging body parts or give a certain pop that would have otherwise been unachievable. Apparently, it was really popular in the 90s and that's what he is discussing right now. I'm not even sure if it's available now. In the 90s, it was pretty popular from what I can tell. Lee Priest: “If you smooth that body part out, you know, it's just going to look soft and watery.  So I'd rather keep the definition and have the illusion of looking bigger, rather than trying the injection.  Again, it's like I think to — anything that you put in your body that inflames the muscle and does it to it, it can't be good for the body if you're inflaming it with an injection.  So, I tried that once and didn't like, it hurt too much, and it went all red and got hot.  It doesn't seem like a good thing to me.” Dangers Of Steroid Administration Tom Platz: “Are there any specific mistakes you've ever made that you'll never do again, in terms of …” Lee Priest: “Maybe like I injected into my calves once, and (INAUDIBLE) the blood (INAUDIBLE), hit a nerve and all that sort of stuff.  So, I normally stick to the …”  [33:27] There are tons of nerves in your calves, so I highly recommend avoiding them. If for some reason you wanted to pin your TRT in there or something, it's not a good spot. It's one of the most nerve dense areas of your body, so definitely avoid your calves at all costs. Lee Priest: “… probably the buttocks area or the shoulder area because people go through that stage where they think that if you inject it into that muscle, that muscle is going to grow bigger.  But it's, like, you know, people forget that buttocks is really a muscle.  The glutes area is a muscle.  So, if that was the case, guys would have glutes the size of a bus.” Tom Platz: “That's true. Yes.” Lee Priest: “It's like it doesn't work that way. So it's like …” [34:02] That's true. Lee Priest:  “… mistakes by trying to put in different body parts and hit nerves and do some of that.  Then, I heard of people injecting straight into their vein which is dangerous doing it because if you're going to inject into the vein and you've got some contaminated stuff.  Well, it'll get to your heart quicker than anything than you did.  So, there are just mistakes like that people will make.  You know, sometimes they'll keep injecting the same spot and they'll get a cyst or boil and have to get cut it or removed and get all the scar tissue.  So there are bad side effects. But … “ Tom Platz: “Ever happened to yourself, as far as injecting the same site?” Lee Priest: “I always keep it moving around. Plus, I never use large amounts in the same area.  There are some guys that will put like maybe 10 cc's in one injection in one spot, and because that won't break down and move in the muscle, it just sits there, and then turns into a cysts or an abscess, so they have to get it cut out.” Why Lee Priest Naturally Grew Gynecomastia (Gyno)? Tom Platz: “How about any effects like gyno, gynecomastia?” Lee Priest: “I had that from a young age myself naturally, so I have a high level of testosterone.  So the age of 13, I had one cut out naturally, so I could like excrete stuff out of my …” [35:00] I already know everyone is going to say, Oh, he had gyno at 13 because he was on steroids then. It does happen where guys, they're natural, just going through puberty, spiking natural testosterone spike aromatization levels and can lead to gynecomastia if there's not an optimal balance of androgens to estrogen. Definitely possible and it's well documented that gyno in puberty does occur in a minority of individuals. I wouldn't discount it entirely that it could have happened naturally. Tom Platz: “So, at 13 — at 13 you had one cut out. So, you weren't taking steroids … “ Lee Priest: “No, I just have a high natural level of testosterone.   So it's like it just grew naturally. But, I've never had them from drugs.” Tom Platz: “Well, some of the newer non-drug like … “ [35:58] That actually makes me think that that's probably why he avoids Androstane in the first place like Testosterone, Dianabol and Equipoise. Clearly, he has a genetic polymorphism that increases the amount of aromatization he has relative to somebody else. Normally, when people go through puberty, Testosterone and DHT spikes, and the ratio of Testosterone aromatizing into Estrogen is still properly maintained, so you don't get gyno. The only way you get gyno is if you have an imbalance where you don't have enough androgen relative to your estrogen. Clearly, Lee has an increased genetic propensity to aromatize significantly more Testosterone into Estrogen. Because simply having a high testosterone level doesn't mean that you're going to get gyno. If you have a high level of aromatization caused by a genetic SNP, it can predispose you to that because of the way you metabolize sex hormones in your body. That's probably the reason he avoids Testosterone to begin with, which is interesting. Lee Priest's Unusually High Natural Testosterone Levels Tom Platz: “Over-the-counter items like Andro, have you ever experimented with those?” Lee Priest: “Not really. I only have — in the offseason with me, I've never really been a big supplement user, well I stick to your basic protein powder.”  [37:21] I bet if you got a genetic test, too, it would show that he has the man boobs gene for sure. Lee Priest: “Powder, maybe a carbohydrate drink.  But when it comes to — maybe a multivitamin.  But, all the other stuff, I never really got into.  Like I said, I got a high natural level of testosterone anyway.  So, boosting it to me doesn't really do anything.  I tried testosterone once.  I used Cypionate and after I got weaker.  So I found my natural level being as high as it was actually benefited me more than actually taking the synthetic stuff.  So, every time I – when I tried it once, my weights just went down and everything.  As soon as I got off, again, my strength came back up, so.” [37:56] Well, he was probably using a dosage that was lower than what he endogenously produces like he already said. But that's just a consequence of using less exogenous hormone than you endogenously produce. It's not like testosterone sucks necessarily. It's just that if you suppress your endocrine function by using a dose lower than what you naturally produce, then, of course, you would experience a decrease in performance, strength, size, etc. That's what I'm assuming happened anyway. Tom Platz: “So prior to an event, it's mostly anabolic substances or none?” Lee Priest: “Not really.  I hardly use any androgenics at all.” Tom Platz: “No androgenic material whatsoever?” Lee Priest: “No.” Lee Priest's Take On Bodybuilder Steroid Abuse In The 90's Tom Platz: ” Interesting. It seems like — to me, it seems like your approach to bodybuilding and drug use is reminiscent of my era when I was competing in the — in the 80s.  It was something that was like almost not as predominant and not – I mean, some of the guys I've interviewed so far today talked about chemical warfare and, you know, $100,000 a year and the risk of insulin where you could, you know, go into comas and things.  And I sitting there like oh my God,” Lee Priest: I'm more of the believer – I've always been a believer in hard training, proper nutrition.  The mental side and getting your mind focused.  And to me, steroids are maybe like a 5 percent, even if that, they're more like an aid, rather than so many people will use them as a crutch, you know, they get them through and take them all the time, you know, I'll train with people who are like, we'll be going heavy and they can't go hit it and they're like, oh, well, I'm not on anything right now.  I'm like, what excuse is that?  They're like, well, no, I'm not on drugs right now, I can't train heavy.  It's like, you know, to me, (INAUDIBLE).  A lot of my best lifts are being, you know, it's like, well, I take drugs, I don't use them to get stronger or get bigger.  So, whereas like I'll just use them for an aid getting ready for a contest to help me recover, stuff like that.  Whereas people these days, it's like more of a crutch they want to lean on.  They want to take large amounts to help them train.  Whereas, you know, where I come back from before when I was — starting off training it was always the hard work, the dedication.  You know, sure, you might use a little bit of drug, but it's just like to aid you to get there, it's not going to help you or make you a champion.  So I just believe in hard training more than drugs, however, these days, some people want drugs before they even start training, so…” Tom Platz: “Yes.  Well, that's a good point. I mean, in terms of our younger viewers or up and coming guys watching this tape, what would you — be your advice to them in terms of — I mean, you — I mean, you already said more should — is less in terms of your own approach?”  Lee Priest: “That's one of those things, like, no matter what sport you're doing, try and do it your best you can without them.  Then if you think you do need to use them, or you know, you look into it, you know, I would say, at least, four or five years in any sport, whether it'd be football, running, whatever.  At least, try and do your best you can naturally, you know.  But then, it's going to come down to your personal choice if you want to use them.  And then if you do use them, just the suggested dose, you know, if the suggested dose is 1 cc, just take that, you know, it will probably work for you.  That's what I've always found.  I've always just stuck to what I felt worked for me.  Whereas, people have come up to me and they said, Lee, you should be taking — you should be taking this and that).  They'll be saying, you should be taking 1500 mg, but I'm like, why?  I said, you know, 200 mg works, why take any more, you know?  But people maybe take more because it's more hearsay more than anything, you know, they hear these guys taking it, they hear these guys taking this.  And they want to keep — you know, if he's taking, I better take it to keep up with him.  But yet, you don't need to, the small works, stick to it.  It always comes down to like when someone does their first course, personally, (INAUDIBLE) too scared to ask a doctor or someone around and does (INAUDIBLE).  So they might ask someone at the gym who's using, you know, tons of drugs, what should I take?  And that guy will say take 1000 mg of these, take five of these, take some of this.  Their first course, they start off on this large amount, and from then on, all they use is large amounts, large amounts.  If they had started off from a smaller amount, they'd find they get the same gains as the large amount, but yet, their minds are now set on this large amount, they got to keep taking more and more because they want to get bigger and bigger which isn't the case.” Why Are Bodybuilders In The 90's So Much Bigger Than Bodybuilders In The 70's and 80's Tom Platz: “Yes. So, what's — what do you account for the reason we're seeing such tremendously — yourself, such tremendously large physiques on the stage today?  I mean, when I was competing in the 80s, you're over 200 – in the 70s, you're over 200 pounds, you're big.  Now, there are guys getting close to 300 pounds and 3 percent body fat.” Lee Priest:  “I think a lot of it, too, you know, maybe genetics, people coming along, maybe nutrition has changed a bit, you know.  Like, back in the early days, it was more of the higher fat foods and the milks and this.  But now, it's more — the diets are changing and even the training is changing.  But, you know, on the genetics, different body types coming through and that whereas even back then you had the freaks back in that day and age.  But now it's like, maybe if you guys are training now, you too would probably look the way some of the guys do now, so. That's one of those things that might be – you know, I can't really say drugs, because drugs have been there for a long time too.” [42:42] I don't think that's accurate. I think, one, the population increases substantially every year. Obviously, there's going to be more genetic outliers with freakish genetics as the years progress. But, in addition, having more drugs more readily available, and just having higher dosages being used, in addition to things like GH and insulin which weren't around in the 70s, I think that accounts for the freak factor in the 90s versus the 70s and 80s. I don't think it's a coincidence that when GH and insulin became abused in the 90s that all the freaks started coming out. Back in the 70s, it sounds like you would have to go to your doctor and ask for a certain amount to be prescribed to you and then that's what you'd be limited to. In the 90s, there's underground labs and whatnot, and you can have access to however much you want and can afford. If you just wanted to abuse stuff, then it's more readily available and easier to get. Plus, there are other things that can blow you up into another dimension that just weren't available in the 70s. I think that's more so what accounts for it because I don't think the guys trained any harder in the 90s than the guys in the 70s, nor do I think they ate significantly better. It's the same kind of food that's around. The only thing that seems to be different is more genetic outliers probably due to population and the drugs. That's what I think. Growth Hormone (GH) Is Not A Miracle Drug Lee Priest: “And I've always been a short (INAUDIBLE) about the growth hormone (INAUDIBLE) but that's what I think Growths aren't one of the drugs that's going to add that much muscle, you know, make someone 40-50 pounds heavier than they would have been without it.  You know, it's going to add a little bit, but, you know, it's nothing that's serious where drugs are going to change someone so greatly. I think it's a variety of things…” [44:27] I kind of agree with him, that GH is not a magic thing that's going to make you grow. It's definitely not. If you look at the clinical data, pretty much any increase in size as a result of GH cannot even be accounted for as muscle tissue. It's always just lean body mass, which could easily just be water, nitrogen retention, or whatever. There is no clinical data proving it actually builds legitimate muscle. The fact is it can keep somebody leaner while they bulk up to that higher body weight that they're trying to get to. In conjunction with the insulin, it creates a storm of anabolism that just wasn't available in the 70s. I think that's more or less what accounts for it. How There Are Increasing Amounts Of Genetic Phenoms In Sport Lee Priest: “Like, training, nutrition, everything genetics, the whole makeup, you know.” Tom Platz: “So, in your opinion, you would tend to believe that — or, you're stating the genetics, basically, we're getting better genetics in the sport, which accounts largely or almost that's the main reason that we're seeing … “ Lee Priest: “I think so too. because the sport these days is much bigger than it was back then.  Back then you had like a small group of people that did it, which was still a large number these days.  The group of people is getting bigger and bigger, more body types are coming into it, so you're seeing the more freaky types coming in.  Whereas, back then, as you say, you only had 50 people doing it back then, now, you got 200 people.  And at 200, there's going to be maybe two or four freaks that come out of it … “ [45:51] I love this pedestal thing with a dumbbell in the background I just noticed. Lee Priest: “You're going to see more people because there's, you know, such like, various types of physique these days.  Whereas, now you got a couple of thousand doing it now, getting into the hundreds of thousands. You're going to have the odd freaks coming out of the woodwork. You just — you look at him, you go, wow, what's he's taking?  But yet, if I'm not taking hardly anything, like I say there's some — back in the, you know, in the farms, you know, (INAUDIBLE) these homebred farm boys, you know, they're massive.  All they do is lift, you know, bales of hay, I know they sort of (INAUDIBLE) onto the trucks and you know, work around the farm.  But yet, naturally, they're naturally big.  If they started training, they could be a freak, you know, maybe five or six years.  So, just something there's more people into it now.  So you're seeing the various types of physiques.  The larger number of people do it, the more people that do it, you're going to have more people coming.  But even now, when you look at bodybuilding today at a top lineup, I could say, 15 Olympias at a top line up for a Mr. Olympia contest, there's 15 people, you might only have four that are really like — you look and say, wow, he's a freak.  The rest have got great physiques, but yet, four of them might stand out as being like out of this world.  So naturally, people say, well, he's taking a lot of drugs to look like that.  Whereas, you know, you're going to have that genetic freak in any sport.  You know, like Michael Jordan in basketball, people can call him a freak for the way he can fly (INAUDIBLE) those baskets, you know.  Come into running, you got Ben Johnson, Carl Lewis, the times, they can put in running, you know, just because they're built for that sport.  So, sometimes there are people that are built for this contest, built for the sport, they're going to be the best at what they do.  And then people are going to always label, you know, drugs, because no one else can do it, but yet, they're maybe just built for that sport.” Lee Priest On SERMs And AI's Tom Platz: “I see.  Have you ever experimented with — or do you have a need to experiment with blocking agents of any kind?” Lee Priest: “No, I've never used them and tried.  Never really had the need to use them, so.” Tom Platz: “How about things like …  [47:43] Well, he did say he uses Nolvadex pre-contest, so that would, I guess, qualify as a blocking agent I'm assuming. I'm assuming he's referring to SERMs and AI's here. Yeah, he does use Nolvadex apparently, so it should be noted. Tom Platz: “Testosterone enhancing drugs … “ Lee Priest: “No.” Tom Platz: “Nothing like that?” Lee Priest: “Never.” Lee Priest's Training Principles Tom Platz: “So, you have a very basic approach to this.” Lee Priest: “You know, my training is basic, and I stick to the basic exercises.  I've always stuck to the basics.  I think that's where people get it wrong sometimes, they might read magazines, listen to people and try and get too scientific.  Whereas, you know, weight training itself isn't really a scientific sport.  It's like, you know, you do the hard work, you lift the weights properly, you get enough rest, you get the nutrition. Eventually, you will start growing and see results, but people want it overnight that's the mistake they're making.  Whereas bodybuilding, lifting weights is a long-term sport, it's going to take years before you might even put 10-pounds on.  However, people want it overnight, so they're going to take drugs and think when they take drugs they can lift a weight, sit back in a chair and tomorrow, I'll be big. It doesn't work that way.  So if you expect that, you might as well not do it, you know, it's just stupidity.  If you've got the time, and you want to put the time into it, training, you know, you got the dedication.  Yes, that's all it takes is time.  So you just got to sort of sit back and train hard and do what you need to do.  And if you're going to use drugs, do it sensibly, but just give it time.  You're not going to — the more you take, you won't get any bigger, so.  Just (INAUDIBLE) sense of really and just you know go by what you believe in, because, you know, the most majority of people not what works for them, but yet, they want to listen to other people too much.  You know, there's going to be people they're going to lead you astray (INAUDIBLE).  (INAUDIBLE) comes down to, you know, your own — what you feel inside, you know, whether it's right or wrong, or if it's too much, you know, don't go along with the crowd, just do what you feel is right for yourself.  You see a lot of guys that do take heaps of drugs and go into the gym (INAUDIBLE) lifting all these weights, but yet, as they come off the drugs, they're back down to like 200 pounds, they go on the drugs, they bloat up with water to 250 then that's it. Who wants to be like that, you know, you puff up, you go down, then I see guys who are using drugs, I look at them like, does he even lift weights, he looks like he's never lifted weight in his life, but yet, the list he'll give you of what he's taking… So it just comes down, like I said – it's more of a mental thing.  To me, training is like I go by how I feel, if I feel strong that day, you know, some days I've benched five plates, 550, but I won't expect that every day.  Those guys do and then they get injured, like — if I go on the gym, bench five plates, that's great.  If they go on the gym the next time, they do chest and I get to three plates and it's heavy, I'll stop at three plates and I'll listen to my body more than anything.  Whereas people are like, I did five plates last time, I'm going to do five plates again.  So I get to three plates, three plates is heavy, add the weight on, then something is going to tear and something goes wrong.  So it's like, that's one of those things you got to listen to yourself really.  It's like it's an individual sport. (INAUDIBLE) people can help you train, you have training partners, you know, people prepare you for shows when it actually comes down to it it's about you knowing your body the best.  It's like any sport Now, there's people out there who say they can help you get ready for shows.  (INAUDIBLE) if you've been doing it long enough, you know what works for you, you know what gets you in shape, you know what gets you strong, you know what you have to do.  So, it's more like listening to yourself.”  Tom Platz: “It's very refreshing to hear that (INAUDIBLE) very, very top guys in the world stating simply that this is the way it is, that I don't use that much.  In fact, I spend next to nothing compared to what some of these guys use. It's very refreshing to me, and I'm sure, some of our viewers won't believe you.”  Lee Priest: “Yes.” Tom Platz: “(INAUDIBLE).  But nevertheless, I want to thank you for coming here and sharing … “ Tom Platz: “The reality of the … “ Lee Priest: “(INAUDIBLE) share this, it's going to come down to personal thing.  As I said, start on a small amount, I guarantee you'll get the same results.  Don't start on a large amount and if the small amount works, stick to that, you know.  Truly, guys, some might tell you to take more and more because they want to get the money out of you.  But, you know, you don't need it.  It just comes down to how you feel (INAUDIBLE) everyone is in this sport for longevity too. So, you want to be around to until 60-70 you know?  Who wants to win a show at the age of 50 die, or age of 45, turnover and die.  So, that's not too healthy, so.”  Tom Platz: “Most definitely.  Thank you.” Lee Priest: “Thank you.”  Tom Platz: “Thanks very much.” Conclusion On Lee Priest's Steroid Cycle [51:46] Well, that was pretty enlightening, to say the least. I'm sure a lot of people will think he's lying obviously. Comment down below what you guys think. Obviously, very conservative use, one of the most insane physiques of all-time, especially, considering the use. It makes you really wonder if the guys who use excessive amounts even needed that much. I don't really know. Anyway, that was pretty much my opinion on it. You guys saw throughout the commentary. Huge props to Lee Priest for not being anonymous about it and just straight up telling us how it is. I can't really knock him for that. Lee Priest's Steroid Cycle After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Lee Priest's steroid cycle dosages he claims his use broke down to the following:  Injectable Stanozolol (Winstrol) – 200 mg per week split into two 100 mg injections every three days. Primobolan – 200 mg per week Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca) – 200 mg per week Anadrol tablets – 50 mg per day Human Growth Hormone (HGH) – 2 IU per day   Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

    "content": "Reacting To And Analyzing Ronnie Coleman’s Steroid Cycle In The 90’s     This interview discussing Ronnie Coleman's steroid cycle was recorded by Tom Platz in the 90's. I don't think a lot of people know it exists to be honest. Tom Platz basically “anonymously” interviewed 6 top tier IFBB pro bodybuilders who compete at the Olympia level. He had them elaborately detail their performance-enhancing drug use, including specific dosages, cycle durations, and more. Of course, them staying anonymous was promised as part of this. Lee Priest was the only one of them who didn't care if the interview was anonymous or not. In this post I'm going to be reacting to and analyzing Ronnie Coleman’s steroid cycle.

I'm not going to say definitively that it's Ronnie Coleman in this interview. My best guess is that it's probably him though. I'm going to be reacting to and commenting on what “perhaps” could be Ronnie Coleman's steroid cycle, the compounds that he used, and the dosages. This is a good insight into what you can expect very likely at the Olympia level with guys with top 0.00001% genetics. Or at least the top pros in the 90's.  What Prompted Ronnie Coleman To Use Steroids Tom Platz: “First question, I'd like to ask you, what prompted you to utilize steroids in the first place for the sport?” Ronnie Coleman: “First, it's like any other type sport, in order to compete and compete with the best guys in the world, you kind of like have to do what it takes to get to the level that they're on. So, I figured that, in order for me to get on the same level that they're on and be on the same ground that they were on, I had to be doing the same thing that they were doing. So, that's pretty much how I made my decision to go to the next level.” Tom Platz: “These are very sensitive issues, and I realized that. Please think about them as long as you need to. But I'd like to talk about steroids, of course, that we just mentioned of. But what specific steroids have you used? And what do you find most effective and also dosage?” Ronnie Coleman: “For me, going back to how I got into it, I didn't know anything about it when I got into the sport. So, I figured out and see what they were doing, see what he was doing, and then try to do the same thing. So, the guy I went to told me some of the things that he was doing. Some of the things that he was doing was Primobolan, Winstrol, Growth Hormone, his regular Testosterone, Anadrol And I think it's what he told me, and I kind of like took it upon myself to go ahead and get the same thing that he was doing. Like I said, when I told you first, I want to be on the same playing ground that they were on. As far as the dosages go, I kind of got with another guy. A newer in depth about how to take certain dosages.” Tom Platz: “Endocrinologist or … ?” Ronnie Coleman: “No, just another guy that was on — they were doing — I didn't want to go to the top guy and say, “Hey, tell me exactly what you're doing and how you're doing it?” and all that kind of stuff, because it's probably kind of make me feel threatened somehow. I don't want to put him on the spot like that. So, I just went to another guy that kind of like knew what the top guys were doing. Ronnie Coleman's Primobolan and Anadrol Use So he just told me just take Primobolan, like three a week.” Tom Platz: “3 cc's or three vials?” Ronnie Coleman: “3 cc's a week. Maybe through the [INAUDIBLE] Anadrol, I might want to take one or two a day. So, I kind of like when I start taking like…” [04:44] That might be 300 mg of Primobolan per week, depending how its dosed, but I'm assuming the concentration was likely 100 mg/mL. It quickly becomes apparent in these interviews that there were no concrete set out protocols. This is more or less what these videos get into too. Basically, whatever they could get their hands on is basically what they ran. If they had access to certain things, then there would be some preference over certain things. But for the most part, pros would just take steroids, and the compounds chosen were more or less based on whatever they could get. So far, 300 mg of Primobolan per week, 50 mg Anadrol per day it sounds like. Ronnie Coleman: “Two a day. And I was [INAUDIBLE] without getting headaches. So, I had to back off and do like one a day because he kind of told me, if you get headaches, you should learn how to back off.” [05:46] Depending on what the dose was, maybe if they were 50 mg, he was doing 100 mg per day, and he dropped down to 50 mg, or he dropped from 50 mg to 25 mg of Anadrol per day. Ronnie Coleman's GH Use Ronnie Coleman: “As far as the GH goes, I just went to the same guy.” Tom Platz: “I want to progress to the GH most definitely, but staying with the steroid discussion, do you — steroids in the offseason and before an event?” Ronnie Coleman: “I only did for an event, and that was it. I never …” Tom Platz: “Even right now, just before an event?” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah. Just — even up to this date, I'll do it [INAUDIBLE]” Tom Platz: “How many weeks up?” Ronnie Coleman: “12, I always started 12 weeks out, which is same time I do a [INAUDIBLE] with my diet.” Ronnie Coleman: “With the GH and of course the other steroids that go along with it.” Tom Platz: “You mentioned a lot of different steroids. The androgenic steroids, which have more secondary male characteristics. And I'm clarifying some of these things just for our viewers. The anabolic steroids, which were more enhancement to the cellular level and less water retention, and maybe you might think less toxic, possibly. But would you use the same kind of steroids prior to — Oh, you don't take steroids, I'm sorry. You just mentioned you don't take steroids in the offseason, only three months prior. So, you would take a mixture of anabolic and androgenic compounds prior to an event?” Ronnie Coleman: “Exactly.” Tom Platz: “Three months out.” Ronnie Coleman: “Three months out.” Ronnie Coleman's Testosterone And Oral Dosages Tom Platz: ” Okay. You mentioned some dosages, of course, of the various Testosterones, and Anadrol.” Ronnie Coleman: “Basically, what we're trying to do is trying to get, like, 1,000 to 1500 mg per week.” Tom Platz: “Is there a formula then?” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah, what we do is combine like Primobolan, which like — they call it, Testex. It's like 250 mg and Deca which is another 200 mg. And another one is called Heptylate it's another 250 mg. And what we do is like Heptylate 250 and 250 is 500, two a week. Testex three a week, which is 250, 250, and 250. That's like 750. So we are we up to like 1000, Primobolan which is about 100. Another 300 on that, so we close to 1500 already. and we throw in stuff, you know, like the tablets. We throw in like Primo tabs and like Dbol tabs. So, that would pretty much be a cycle that we stay on our way up to about eight weeks. No, we do it for like 10 weeks. And like the last two weeks, you know, do nothing.” Tom Platz: “Okay. The weekly dosaging is 1500 mg of combined …” Ronnie Coleman: “1500 mg combined with GH.” Tom Platz: “OK. And the last two weeks, nothing — no drugs whatsoever.” Ronnie Coleman: “Nothing. None whatsoever.” Tom Platz: “Drop it — there's no descending dosages, just drop it?” Ronnie Coleman: “Just drop the drug, drop to cold turkey pretty much. And the GH was the same way. We're getting in like 4 IUs a day. It was the same way. It was all [INAUDIBLE] we took everything.” Genetic Response To Steroids [09:40] You can already see how guys with top genetic response, they still used what objectively is high dosages to a normal person. To a lot of guys who think the pros must be taking 10 times more than everyone else just because they're bigger than everyone else, it's probably more likely because they have an insane genetic response. And then, a lot of guys are going to say, “Oh, well, the steroid quality was better back then it was all pharma grade.” It's stupidly easy to get good gear now. If you can't get it, then you're not well connected. Even getting pharma-grade stuff, it's not super difficult, even if you had to go that route. I think that's just a dumb excuse when people say the steroids were way better back then. Obviously, if you have Parabolan amps from France, it's going to be accurately dosed Trenbolone (Tren), for example. Trenbolone is Trenbolone, people can make accurately dosed Tren in underground labs with high quality too. If you use a crappy lab's gear, then obviously your results will reflect that, but it's really not hard to find high quality product nowadays. The entire androgen load per week of 1500 mg plus orals probably Ronnie Coleman at a total dosage of approximately 2000 mg per week, which is quite a bit objectively. But for a guy who's one of the top bodybuilders in the world, is it really that much compared to what some guys are doing that are at regional levels nowadays that are using twice or three times as much? It just goes to show how much genetics plays into this. 4 IUs of GH, too. Dropping Everything Two Weeks Prior To A Competition Tom Platz: “Prior to the event, you stopped the GH, too?” Ronnie Coleman: “Stop the GH, stopped everything.” Tom Platz: “Oh, I see.” Ronnie Coleman: “And other things we might use for our appetite stimulant and we took two of those a day. There's another appetite to emulate Another one we took — can't think of the name. My bad. So now, the appetite stimulant, I'll think of it probably later on.” Tom Platz: “So, you have a problem with appetite, really?” Ronnie Coleman: “Well, no, no, I just took it just to keep it going. Keep it fast and you stay hungry all the time.” Tom Platz: “So, this enhance your metabolism?” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah, just to enhance your metabolism. Everything you ate, you went right through you real, real quick. Your body digesting food, so that way you wouldn't hold any fat.” Tom Platz: Okay. So, this is like a thyroid preparation.” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah, exactly. So, that kind of kept burning, kept it going so you wouldn't hold any fat in.” Tom Platz: “Does that stop the last two weeks though?” Ronnie Coleman: “That's stopped also. Everything is stopped like the last two weeks. I mean, you just stop, cold turkey, and just pretty much finished a workout. You know, do a little cardio, stuff like that. [13:27] So, Ronnie claims he cut out everything two weeks out, which is really interesting, too. Ronnie Coleman's Insulin Use Tom Platz: “Okay, now, how about insulin? Is that something you utilize also?” Ronnie Coleman: “No, only time we did that was carb-up phase. It was incorporated like being carb depleted for like, you know, I'll get like 600 g protein Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. On Wednesday we carb back up with insulin Wednesday and Thursday, just two days.” Tom Platz: “So, the insulin would help.” Ronnie Coleman: “Slowly fill you back out.” Tom Platz: “I see.” [14:05] As you can see, he's talking about using insulin in a carb up context in terms of glycogen loading the muscle as opposed to using it all through the offseason to build tissue. The 90's is known as the beginning of the era of insulin abuse. It's kind of interesting to hear him delve into that. Ronnie Coleman: “Kind of sugar and carbohydrates [INAUDIBLE] Probably took in anywhere from, I say, 600 to 700 g of carbs. We're trying to do — trying to get to a point where we can't like over carb And we use [INAUDIBLE] to come back down off of.” Tom Platz: “Friday to come back down, what do you mean exactly?” Ronnie Coleman: “Bring it back down to normalcy? On Friday, I went — I went out and be like 600 a day like on a Wednesday and Thursday. And I went back real down — real low on Friday. So, we'll come back down and not over carb. Yes, that kind of way.” Tom Platz: “I see. Okay. Diuretic Use I guess the next thing we should discuss which comes to my mind would be the use of diuretics.” Ronnie Coleman: “As far as diuretics go, what we do starting on Sunday and take like 100 mg of Aldactone. Did 100 Sunday, 100 Monday, 100 on Tuesday and Wednesday. It'd be probably about 125, 150 Aldactone, Thursday, about 150. Friday, we cut Aldactone out and went to Aldactazide and probably went back 75 mg.” Tom Platz: “What's the difference between Aldactone and Aldactazide?” [15:54] It's interesting, that protocol that he's describing from the 90s, I'm still seeing it nowadays being passed around. When I was into hardcore bodybuilding years back, I remember I was given a diuretic protocol by a high level bodybuilder locally. It was pretty much identical to what he just said, except it started around Tuesday of peak week as opposed to the weekend before, which I feel like is pretty far out to be depleting yourself of water. This goes to show that these things are more so passed down the grapevine as opposed to being based on scientific reasoning. The guy who's better than you or placing better than you, “What's he doing?” “He does this?” “Well, I guess that's what we should do,” kind of thing. These protocols aren't anything next level or extraordinary. You've already heard the dosages aren't obscenely sky high like you would expect. That Aldactone leading into Aldactazide diuretic protocol, it's very standard and still passed around to this day, except most will use Dyazide on the Friday instead of Aldactazide. Ronnie Coleman: “Aldactone was pretty much to get your body used to taking the water out of it. Aldactazide drys you out.” It gives the harshest diuretic of them all.  So, we used that to just completely dry out.” Tom Platz: “That was at the very end?” Ronnie Coleman: “At the every — that was at Friday.” Tom Platz: “Friday, okay.” Ronnie Coleman: “You had to be real careful with that one. It would get you to the point where you'd like be dehydrated if you didn't do it right. I almost screwed up with it one time. [INAUDIBLE]” Tom Platz: “As far as too many diuretics?” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah.” GH + Insulin Usage Tom Platz: “Did we discuss insulin? Did we talk about …” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah. Only time I did that (insulin) was just to carb up.” Tom Platz: “To carb up only.” Ronnie Coleman: “Yes, only. That's it.” Tom Platz: “Because you don't think the GH and insulin …” Ronnie Coleman: “I didn't do the GH and insulin thing together.” Tom Platz: “I see. It's very interesting.” Ronnie Coleman: “I didn't think I needed that much [INAUDIBLE] And I was kind of scared of it, too. I didn't want to become like insulin-dependent.” Tom Platz: “Do you think some of the guys experienced that?” Ronnie Coleman: “That was one of the reasons why I don't want to do it because I've heard a lot of stories about some guys had become like that. I was like, Oh, no, that's the last thing I need.” [18:22] He's basically saying here he didn't use a ton of insulin, he just used it for carb loading because he didn't want to become a type two diabetic. At least, that's what I gather from what he's saying. Tom Platz: “Precautions and all your concerns about the risks.” Ronnie Coleman: “Oh, yeah. But as far as my health goes, I have my blood work done. I have it done every year. Didn't have any problem with liver, kidney. None of that stuff. I'll [INAUDIBLE] because you know going in to it, I thought that the dosages would, you know, like screw up my liver and kidney. Just stuff that I've heard. But when he told me then, you know, the year before that and the year before that I had it tested and they were all kind of normal like.” Tom Platz: “So, you approach it pretty much from a systematic point of view. And not that — the long durations not for a year.” Ronnie Coleman: “No, I try not to abuse it and, you know, get hooked on it. I just have to take it, bring my body up and back down, and that kind of stuff. So that's why I just periodically use it just for contest only. I've never had to use it off-season. That's a period for my body to get back to normal, basically. I think it's good to like shock your body like that. And, you know, when it comes time to take it in, it's something new to your body. So, it reacts better, I think. Because that's when that would work for me. I think everybody is different, though.” Ronnie Coleman's Scariest Experiences With Diuretics Tom Platz: “Has anything ever happened? And of course your identity is disguised here. None of the viewers will know who you are. But is anything ever happened that really scared you, or any that …” Ronnie Coleman: “Oh, yeah, a couple times. The first time it happened, I was taking diuretics. And I was going from one city to another. And I had missed the airplane. So I was on schedule like be at the contest the day that I was in the air. And so I was up in the air, and all of the sudden, I just got real week. I started sweating real bad, and I was there by myself. I was in a foreign country. Nobody didn't know what was going on. I thought I'm going to die in this airplane, and that scared me to death. The flight attendant just happened to be walking through at the same time that that was happening. And she had some food, and I just grabbed it, [INAUDIBLE] and I just started eating and drinking. And that kind of brought my body back to where it needed to be. Because I stopped sweating, you know, the weakness [INAUDIBLE] went away, but it's a real, real scary feeling. Especially when nobody see — I was all alone, nobody was with me. Nobody [INAUDIBLE] nobody spoke English, nothing. So I just knew that this was it. That was one time. There's been another time. Another time I had to — I was drying out. And I was in bed. I've been going to the bathroom for about, say, about once every 30 minutes. I probably just, you know, just took in too many diuretics. It was kind of hard to get the exact science down. Tom Platz: “So, it's sort of thing you have to play it by ear almost.” Ronnie Coleman: “Yes, play it by ear almost. And I was lying in bed, I was getting ready to get up to go use the bathroom because I was going every 30 minutes. I didn't get any sleep. I was getting ready to get up and I cramp, the worst cramp ever in my life hit me in my stomach. I've never had a cramp there before. I go [INAUDIBLE] but I had somebody with me so I wasn't scared. As soon as I moved to grab that cramp, another cramp hit me on my leg. I'm like, oh, no. I could've ruined my life for this was — this was a big show. [INAUDIBLE] ruin my life [INAUDIBLE] I'm not doing this contest. I'm going to the doctor right now. And that's the first thing I thought, you know, I don't want to get on stage now that happened. Because that was the worst cramp I ever had in my whole entire life. I said, I'm not doing this show, I'm going to do the doctor right now. But I had to have a friend in the room with me. And he said, Hey, just start eating and he — I grabbed a bottle of water and I drunk the whole like half a gallon of water. And it went away. But that was the — those are the two scariest moments in my life.” Tom Platz: “Mostly from diuretics.” Ronnie Coleman: “Diuretics. So, I say diuretics is the most dangerous thing. That's dangerous than steroid. I've never had [INAUDIBLE] [23:16] That's something to note, too, is diuretics are something that can screw with your electrolyte balance so severely, you can cause instant death if you really screw it up. While steroids progressively over the years are going to exacerbate cardiovascular disease and cause a myriad of issues, things in the short term, diuretics are going to really f*ck people up. Be careful with that. I actually have a friend personally who had a cardiac event. He had a heart attack and borderline renal failure as a result of a stupid coach who gave him a bad diuretic protocol. Fortunately, he's fine now, but it scared him so bad and almost killed him that he stopped bodybuilding entirely. He was a pro-caliber classic physique competitor. You have to be really careful with that stuff, especially if you don't know exactly what you're doing. Drug Testing In The IFBB In The 90's Tom Platz: “I understand in the top shows, nowadays, it wasn't this way when I was competing, that they test only for steroids — I mean, only for diuretics. Is that to the event, how to get around the test?” Ronnie Coleman: “They test for diuretics.  If you look at the list of diuretics, there's like maybe 100 diuretics on there. There are probably like maybe 120, 130 diuretics out there, you know, in the world.” [24:59] This is so ridiculous, those tests. I don't know if it was just a marketing thing to make it seem like they test bodybuilders to make it seem like it's not such a drug abuse-ridden sport. They tested guys in the 90s for diuretics, but they wouldn't test them for steroids, or for anything else, it was just diuretic use. Potentially, it was just to persuade bodybuilders to not do something really dangerous that could put their health in jeopardy in pre-contest scenario, where they're trying to get as dry as possible. I'm surprised they wouldn't test for Aldactone and Dyazide because, in this era, that's the only diuretics we really know of that are used for bodybuilding. Hydrochlorothiazide is one of them. That might even be the active ingredient of Dyazide. Dyazide, Aldactone, Lasix, those are pretty much the only ones I can name off the top my head. Dandelion root and over the counter things that some people use as well. If they're testing for over 100 diuretics, and they don't have the two main ones that guys use, I don't know what the point of that was, but interesting to hear nonetheless. Ronnie Coleman: “If you look at the list, of course, they're testing for a whole bunch of diuretics. But you can look at the one that they're not testing for. And those are ones that you can use. It's just like with anything else, you know, if you design a test for something, there's always going to be a way around it. It's like for steroid. If they're testing for steroids, there's always going to be some way that you can get around. Because they've done that before, too. And the same thing with diuretics.” Ronnie Coleman's Scariest Experience With Insulin Tom Platz: “Now, we mentioned before — I'm going to step back slightly to where we spoke about or you spoke about using insulin on during the loading up phase, the carbing phase prior to an event. You ever had any ill experiences or negative experience with insulin?” Ronnie Coleman: “Oh, yeah, I forgot about that one. Yeah, first time I ever did it, you know, you have to eat, like a ton of carbs and a ton of sugar all at one time. And so, that's what I did, I ate [INAUDIBLE] apple pie filling, about three or four bananas, a whole bunch of dates and raisins, a whole bunch of oatmeal with a lot of sugar in it. So, I knew what I was supposed to do. And all of a sudden …” [27:35] Here I am talking about insulin and blood sugar management, in general. As you can tell, he's a genetic phenom by the lack of his understanding of this concept, but what he looks like, irrespective of that. Ronnie Coleman: “You know, like, three hours later, I'm driving down the street, and all of a sudden I started sweating real bad. And my appetite just started right back up. Like I hadn't eaten in the whole day. I'm like, here we go again.” Tom Platz: “Describe the feeling a little bit to us.” Ronnie Coleman: “Okay, the problem I had with the insulin, I took it, like early in the morning. And I took, you know, probably about 500 or 600 grams — no, about 200 grams of carbs at the same time. And it was supposed to, like, make up for the insulin that I just put inside my body. I didn't know anything about, you know, a reaction that was going to happen afterwards. And I was riding down the street, and all of a sudden, I started sweating real bad. I started getting real, real weak. And it was almost the exact same feeling that I had with the diuretics, except I didn't catch any cramps. I was sweating real bad, I was getting real warm. Just so happen, I just had — I don't know — I just happened to have some food in my car with me. And I just started shoving it down, shoving it down real, real fast. I had rice and meat and some bananas and stuff. And after I got that in my system, I got my level back up to where it needs to be. I stopped sweating and weak — And then, and the feeling weak all went away. So, that's another thing you got to be careful with the insulin.” Tom Platz: “Do you find the insulin and then the diuretics being the most sensitive things to utilize?” Ronnie Coleman: “The most sensitive things are those two things. And not only that, they're the most dangerous, they're the one that can kill you quicker than anything than any kind of steroid out there, the insulin and diuretics.” Tom Platz: “How much insulin would you take then a day? I think we've covered …” Ronnie Coleman: I'd probably do like — we use one called Humulin R and we take like 15 units twice a day. And we're not doing that …” Yes, the last week cycle.” [30:06] 30 units for carb-loading during peak week, I guess. Ronnie Coleman: “I wanted to do that I could say you have to take about 200 grams of carbs and sugars altogether. And like I said, sometimes like to — insulin shock, it could hit you and you have to take in a whole bunch more and get over that to keep you from going into a coma.” Tom Platz: “That's scary?” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah, real scary.” Ronnie Coleman's Yearly Steroid Cycle In Relation To Bodybuilding Events Tom Platz: “Well, another question I have for you would be, if you're entering more than one show a year. And I understand you do enter more than one show a year. So, this — if you're entering, I don't know, up to 10 shows a year, would you be on steroids more than just prior to the event? Was a lot of event — multiple events.” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah. So, like the season starts in February, late February, early March. And you — what we probably do is start like in December and get, you know, those three months in December, January, February. The show will probably last maybe — I'll probably go back to back, maybe three shows [INAUDIBLE] the two weeks out from the first show. So, you just do it at that point. And for me, I'd rest for like late March into the next three months for the next year. So, you probably do like two cycles a year, two three-month cycles.” [31:41] He's saying he's only on steroids for six months of the year and the rest of it he's natural. Of those cycles, they only top out about two grams per week. Granted a lot of guys, when they're using three grams, they'll tell people they only run one. When people are using a gram, they'll say they're on 500 mg just to make it not seem like they're such abusers. I think he's probably an honest dude and he thinks he's anonymous right now, so I think he's probably telling the truth. It just goes to show what a lot of guys nowadays are doing themselves and how heavy the abuse is now, in contrast to what was considered extreme back in the 90's. Tom Platz: “Too many cycles that [INAUDIBLE] be in more than two shows, would you be on longer duration?” Ronnie Coleman: “No, because basically, you just use what you had in your system now to go on for another show, unless they were like, three, four months apart. Most of the shows are like as one this week and there's another next week, and there's another one a week after that. You do the same stuff that you took for the last three months for all those three shows.” Ronnie Coleman's Take On Aromatase Inhibitors (AI's) Tom Platz: “Another question I would have would be, are there problems you've ever experienced with enhanced estrogen levels? In other words, do you have blocking agents you might utilize during the course of your yearly training protocol?” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah. When I was coming up, they always told me that Nolvadex was the best blocking agent out there. And so, that's what I took. But we did some studies. Another guy that had his own lab and was doing studies on a whole bunch of guys. And we found out that if you took Nolvadex it negated the effects of GH. So, what we did, we did a blood test, urine test. And he told us Testosterone level. What's it called? GH level, but it's not called GH, it's called …” Tom Platz: “IGF” Ronnie Coleman: “Yup, yup. And we found out that Nolvadex negated the effects of the IGF-1. And so Nolvadex was a no, no.” [34:25] That's the reason why you don't use SERMs and AI‘s if you don't need them, as they can inhibit IGF-1. Ronnie Coleman Talks About Gynecomastia (Gyno) Ronnie Coleman: “Thing that we found out didn't even work. It probably blocked a little Estrogen but it didn't do the job. So, they did some more studies, this laboratory did, and they came up with another drug that worked. That drug was called Teslac.” Tom Platz: “How do you spell that, do you know?” Ronnie Coleman: “T-E-S-L-A-C. I think I forget what it's used for, but the study that they did were on adolescent kids. That had, I can't think of what they had.” Tom Platz: “Adolescent children with some kind of an illness growth problem?” Ronnie Coleman: “From the chest area.” Tom Platz: “I think they were cardiac problems?” Ronnie Coleman: “No, it was called — they call it gyno.” [35:34] It's funny, saying this term like it's foreign. Gynecomastia or gyno, that's perhaps one of the first times it was brought up in public. Funny because I'm pretty sure everyone here knows what gyno is. Here we have literally Mr. Olympia, trying to figure out what the word is for something you would think he would know off the top of his head. To me, it's just baffling and crazy how there was so much limited knowledge. It was all just passed through the grapevine. There were only a few credible sources back then that you could even refer to for some information. Genetics trumps all, that's what I'm getting out of this. That's what you guys should get out of this, too. Teslac Vs Nolvadex Usage Ronnie Coleman: “Test on the kids, see how it affected gyno and it made the lumps in the chest go down. This is the drug that we found out after all the studies that worked. Nolvadex was pretty much just a myth. Number one, it didn't work. Number two, it negated the effects of GH. I think the best information I can pass along to up and coming guys is don't take Nolvadex.” Tom Platz: “How about Clomid?” Ronnie Coleman: “Clomid works. Clomid, Nolvadex — Clomid and Teslacs. I think there's one other …” [37:07] Ronnie Coleman doesn't think you should use Nolvadex. I'm assuming on cycle as opposed to off, but I don't even know if they did PCT back then. Ronnie Coleman: “I just can't think of it, but the one I [INAUDIBLE] I thought that would work, but really didn't was Nolvadex. It negated the effects of GH.” Does Insulin Makes You Fat? Tom Platz: “Okay. You don't feel there's any significance to insulin making you hold more body fat. That's not a problem?” Ronnie Coleman: “I think it's probably going to depend on — a lot has — a lot has probably do with genetics as far as making you hold a lot of body fat. But for the most part, every bodybuilder has real good genetics so it's not going to make him hold that much body fat. Apparently, it works really good on bodybuilders because it worked really good on me as far as pushing, you know, glycogen in the muscle. So, I don't think it makes you —  That's why you probably have us it with GH.” [38:10] He's pretty much saying he doesn't think insulin makes you fat. I've done an article on this and a video on this. “Insulin & Body Fat Gain, The Number 1 Reason Why 90% Of Bodybuilders Just Get Fat.” First off, if you're Ronnie Coleman and you're 300 pounds shredded, you could eat whatever you want, and you have so much muscle on your body that's just going to rip through calories. Your metabolism is so fast it doesn't matter what you eat pretty much. For the average guy, insulin is going to potentially overspill. With the way a lot of guys take it where they just smash tons of high glycemic carbs with it and eat in a stupid high surplus and don't use it intelligently, you're going to get fat as hell using insulin if you don't very carefully calculate your use of it. Ronnie Coleman: “And it kind of like negates to the fat amount that your body would hold.” Tom Platz: “Negates the fat amount in terms of insulin.” Ronnie Coleman: “As far as your body fat percentage. You know, you're probably …” [39:21] He's implying that using GH concurrently with insulin is what mitigates the fat storage effects of it. Yeah, GH has some lipolysis benefits that go along with it, but the reality is the synergy between GH and insulin has more to do with the IGF-1 pathway and less to do with the GH inherently melting fat off. GH And Insulin Synergy Ronnie Coleman: “A lot more body fat if you didn't take the GH with the insulin.” Tom Platz: “I see, I see.” Ronnie Coleman: “It will probably help. That's why the two work so good together. But if you just took it by itself, it'll probably just make you fat. If you get the GH working with it to help lean you out, it's going to make you hold more lean body mass” [40:16] I agree with that. I would never use insulin by itself unless I was diabetic and needed it. I more or less agree with what he's saying here, I just think the mechanism of action is a bit different than what he is asserting. Tom Platz: “I guess there's no particular masking agents you use based upon the fact that there's so many — as you indicated, there's so many different diuretics to select from.” Ronnie Coleman: “There's no masking agents out as far as I know of. And I've been around for quite a while. I've talked to all the top guys, all the top trainers. There are no masking agents.” Site Enhancing Oil (SEO), Esiclene and Nolotil Tom Platz: “How about compounds like Esiclene, or things that are injected directly into the muscle? Is there anything like that you found to be effective.” [41:50] He's talking about things like site enhancing oil. Back then, Esiclene and Nolotil were the two things used to inflame the muscle. When you jab it right before a show, it will blow it up with inflammation and can give the illusion of a bigger and fuller muscle belly. It's less widely used now (as far as I know), but back then it was really popular. It was like an instant way to bring up a lagging body part before a show. Ronnie Coleman: “I've found Esiclene to be effective for about maybe four or five hours, at the most. And that's about it. They're supposed to have a new one out, called “Pump And Pose” with a lot of fat. I think that's all its probably going to do because I know some friend of mine who took it.” [42:44] Pump And Pose, I'm pretty sure is just first-generation Synthol consisting of MCT oil with some alcohol in it essentially. Ronnie Coleman: “It made them fat. It didn't make your muscle no bigger or nothing. I guess its a myth, sort of like Nolvadex. It supposed to work all these wonders, but it really — and it actually, it didn't do a whole lot for you. Tom Platz: “So do you ever utilize …” Ronnie Coleman: “It hurts you more, it works for you.” Tom Platz: “In terms of these injection directly injecting into the muscle and temporarily increasing the size. You don't you don't follow that regimen?” Ronnie Coleman: “I don't follow that one.” Tom Platz: “Is there any concerns — I mean, you've talked about a few of the situations you've encountered from diuretics or from insulin that scared you. Are there any concerns or advice you would give to the up and coming guy who looks at the top guys and says I want to go there?” Ronnie Coleman: Yeah, I have some real good advice. If you're going to take diuretics, get with somebody that knows exactly what they're doing. And when you do take, make sure you're always around people that know what's going on. Insulin, the same way, don't go and read some magazine that says, take this amount. To do this, go with somebody that has experienced it, is trained to be — has trained people to do it. And knows exactly how it's going to work. And when you take it, never be alone. If you're alone, make sure you have plenty of food and water with you at all times. Ronnie Coleman's Steroid Cycle Cost Per Contest Tom Platz: Very interesting. On a yearly basis, or annual basis, whether you're in one show a year or multiple shows, I guess it would vary, but how much money does it cost to get in shape? Roughly, approximately. Ronnie Coleman: ” A guesstimate, $15,000.00″ Tom Platz: “$15,000 for like one show?” Ronnie Coleman: “For one show, one show, just for one show. If you go into the show …” [45:14] $15,000 for prep, supposedly. The majority of that's probably for the growth hormone because back then it was pharma grade or nothing, pretty much. I'm sure the kits back then have formidable prices to what they are now, even with all the inflation from what I've seen. I watched this interview a while ago for the first time, but let's see what he says in terms of how he breaks down that cost. Ronnie Coleman: “And the top five is just $10,000. You're going to lose …” Tom Platz: “Minus taxes or …?” Ronnie Coleman: “You're going to lose money, either way, you look at it. You may need to do the smaller show to build your status. That's why it's good for them to put the small shows back-to-back. You go — you get first, you're still in the hole. If you do a second show, and you get first, you'll make some money?” Tom Platz: “I see. That's …” Ronnie Coleman: “It all depends on how well prepared you want to be. The more prepared you are, the better you do.” Tom Platz: “You think that the top pros in the sport make a good living?” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah, that's going to all depend on how well you do in contests. If you're not placing the top five, you're going to lose in every show you go to point-blank, you'll never make any money. So, if you're not placing top five in any show — in any post-show, you're losing money.” The Struggles Of Pro-Level Bodybuilders Then And Now [46:56] Times have changed. You could be like a top 50 guy now, or you could not even be in the running at a local regional show and still get rich just by having great content online. These guys are born 20 years too soon because they have just crazy, insane physiques. Busting their ass to get on stage and look insane, spending all this money to look insane. And they're basically depending on prize money and sponsorships, whereas nowadays, they could have social media and have their own thing going and start their own businesses. It sucks to see how limited these guys were where only the top five of the guys were profitable. Tom Platz: “That's too bad. Are the exhibitions and the seminars as prominent as they were in the 80's? I was competing in the 80's, and that's why I'm …” Ronnie Coleman: “I'll say it like this.  You're only going to get small amount because there's so much competition between all the guys.  So that will make up for some of it, but not a whole lot it. Over The Counter Drugs And Supplements Tom Platz: “I see. Are there any things that aren't — you know, there are over the counter drugs like Andro. Is that something that — have you used or think it's effective?” Ronnie Coleman: “I think the best over the counter drugs are Andro, HMB, and Creatine. And of course, you know, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and all regular vitamins like magnesium and all that kind of stuff that your body kind of like needs to operate on a regular basis. More work, but the most part, you know, the proteins work good for me. Creatine works good for me. HMB has worked good for me. Andro — all the Andro products have worked good for me.” Tom Platz: “Most of these products you just mentioned, are they used during the — prior to competitive time or when you're not really competing?” Ronnie Coleman: “Probably competing.” Tom Platz: “So, they actually enhance you think the effectiveness of the real drugs?” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah, I think so. And every probably is going to have their own opinion, because some people don't use them because they think they're going to get what they need from just the steroid, but I think they work good hand in hand. They've always worked good for me.” Tom Platz: “I understand. Well, I sincerely appreciate you coming here today, and sharing these really rather sensitive subjects matter with our audience. And, again, I want to assure you, your identity will be totally protected. And no one will know who you are, except myself, which will never be told anyone. Okay? But hopefully, by you know, one thing — by doing this, we can relay to our viewers and our audience that, you know, there are some negative connotations or some precautions you …” Ronnie Coleman: “Definitely have to take.” Tom Platz: “Okay. Most definitely.” Do Steroids Create The Essence Of A Champion? Tom Platz: “And I don't know how you feel about this, but do you really think that steroids create the essence of a champion?” Ronnie Coleman: “It's just like with any other, well, sport, you have to have natural talent, you have to have genetics and of course with bodybuilding, steroids are just going to make it all that much better. So, to be here, you have to have it.” Tom Platz: “So, to compete on a level of pro-level …” Ronnie Coleman: “You have to have it.” Tom Platz: “Okay. You don't know any pros who don't use it?” Ronnie Coleman: Yeah. You can't get — probably maybe a couple, but they're not doing top five in all the shows. They'll probably do okay, but once you get to the Olympia level and all the bigger contests, you have to have it. You have to have it to compete just for the game.” Tom Platz: “Okay. So, what you're saying basically, is steroids do work, of course.” Ronnie Coleman: “Do work, of course.” Tom Platz: “Are they magic?” Ronnie Coleman: “They're not magic, you have to train hard, you have to work hard, you have to be dedicated, you have to do what it takes to be the best.  I mean, you can't rely solely on one thing and be one dimensional.  You have to have good genetics, you can't be a top professional without it; you have to work out hard; you have to be dedicated; you have to adhere to a strict diet. All those things combined makes you a great champion, along with steroids, but you can't have one and not the other.” Tom Platz: “Regarding the Teslac and the Clomid and various blocking agents or natural testosterone enhancing agents, is that used in conjunction with the steroids, or is that used when you're off steroids?” Ronnie Coleman: “Okay. As far as the Teslac goes, that is used in conjunction; and that start the same day that you start your cycle. You can stay on the Teslac as long as you want to, but once your cycle over with, then you incorporate the other blocking agent, Clomid. I guess because your body is so used to the Teslac, and, you know, build up a tolerance to it, so you want to add something else after the cycle. And Clomid is the one to bring your natural testosterone back up, because once you get off cycle, it's going to take maybe like two to three months for your natural Testosterone to kick in. Your girlfriends not going to be happy at all with that. So, you use the Clomid, the HCG …” Tom Platz: “Right. Together?” Ronnie Coleman: “Yes, together to kick it back into the cycle. And, of course, they have some drugs for the liver, also. One is called Legalon. It helps bring the liver back up to par.” Tom Platz: “In terms of what function? Enzyme …” Ronnie Coleman: “Yeah. Bring the — bring the enzyme level back down. So, you know, to a normal level.” Tom Platz: “This is, again, done with the — in the off — when you're off of … Ronnie Coleman: “[INAUDIBLE] Legalon is one of them. And Milk Thistle is the natural one that you can use.” Tom Platz: “Milk Thistle? I see.” Ronnie Coleman: “And I think that's basically it.” Educating Teenagers on Bodybuilding And Steroid Abuse Tom Platz: “One question I'd like you to respond to, which is not directly related to certain products or drugs. What are you think feelings on about — I mean, granted, this is where the pros are, this is what the pros are doing. And this is why we're here today to provide this education and insight. But in terms of how the teenager or the young first [INAUDIBLE] in terms of bodybuilding views, the pros. I mean, what is your advice or suggestions or do you have anything to address in terms of the younger person looking at you guys on stage?” Ronnie Coleman: “It's the hardest thing in the world to accept as a teenager. That steroids are not — are not going to make you grow like you want to grow. Because when you young, you want to be as big as you possibly can be. And you're thinking you want to be as big as you possibly can be as fast as possible can be, and that's when a mistake occurs.  You have to — it takes time. Your body doesn't — I think it doesn't start maxing out until your late 30's, if you do it right.” Tom Platz: “And again, I want our viewers to be aware of the fact that we're not recommending or prescribing any of these drugs mentioned or specific dosage patterns [INAUDIBLE]. We're not prescribing or recommending any specific dosages or specific drugs. We're merely providing this information, and this insight is educational and informative, so we can really, for the first time as I see address the issues in terms of reality. And I think as we address these issues for the first time, in terms of reality, hopefully, we can make a difference in terms of some of the abuse of drugs that we were speaking about in terms of the teenagers and the younger people, looking at the top pros in the world. And maybe even amongst themselves, we can instill a healthier standard of competition, which is important to us all.” Conclusion On Ronnie Coleman's Steroid Cycle [56:07] In closing, it's pretty insightful to see what Ronnie Coleman's steroid cycle was in the 90's. I'm not going to say 100% definitively, that's what he used, but it pretty much boiled down to about two grams of steroids a week, 4 IUs of GH, insulin for carb loading pre-contest, and only staying on steroids for six months out of 12 months of the year. And that's top of the top tier of elite bodybuilders. You have guys who are literally cruising on 500 mg of Testosterone year-round, and then blasting with like, five, six grams to compete at regional shows. This goes back to my genetics discussion that I always go back to, and I've had in several of my past articles. If you're going to be in this sport, just be aware of the risks. The disclaimer that Tom Platz laid out at the end of that interview, I couldn't have said it better myself. There comes a point where you have to realize pushing it more is just not going to yield any additional return above and beyond a certain point. At that point, you're just playing with fire and pushing your body for no reason. If you're pushing a few grams of steroids and you're still competing at regional shows and not placing well, and if you're not planning on dying within the next 10 years, then bodybuilding is probably not for you. You should take a step back and reconsider some things. I had some aspirations of potentially being a pro when I was obsessed with bodybuilding. When I was 20 years old I literally thought I was going to blast steroids and get to 260 pounds lean with ease. I was so oblivious to what actually occurs from using these hormones, especially for prolonged periods of time and what that's going to do to your body. I'm not trying to fear monger steroid use or anything like that. I'm just saying, take a step back and realize that the guys at the top probably aren't using 10 times more than you are like a lot of guys will lead you to believe. Everyone seems to think they're using some secret compound and that's why they're so huge, or they have Increlex, or they used 20 grams of gear and 500 IUs of insulin. It's probably not the case, they probably use the exact same stuff you do. They just have insane genetics. Just a reality check. Ronnie Coleman's Steroid Cycle After listening to the entire interview, at the peak of Ronnie Coleman's steroid cycle dosages pre-contest he claims his use broke down to the following:  Testex (concentration of 250 mg/mL) – 750 mg per week split into one 250 mg injection three times per week Primobolan (concentration of 100 mg/mL) – 300 mg per week split into one 100 mg injection three times per week Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca) – 200 mg per week (unclear if he used more than 200 mg per week or not) Testosterone Heptylate (concentration of 250 mg/mL) – 500 mg per week split into one 250 mg injection twice per week Primobolan, Dbol or Anadrol tablets – Roughly 25-100 mg per day depending on the oral steroid chosen Human Growth Hormone (HGH) – 4 IU per day Humulin R Insulin – 30 IU split into two 15 IU injections only for the carb up phase before a competition   Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

Typically, this goes completely unnoticed because steroid users only check their Testosterone and Estrogen levels in their blood work, and 99% of those who actually use Nandrolone, use it concurrently with Testosterone as a base. The net result is a blood test with an artificially elevated Testosterone level above what would have been recorded without the Nandrolone present, because the assay used cannot differentiate between the two hormones. Deca Only For Hormone Replacement Therapy Recently I decided I wanted to explore Deca/NPP (Nandrolone) monotherapy as a potential hormone replacement therapy alternative. I feel that Nandrolone is one of the most efficacious steroids that exists, and its relative lack of androgenicity in contrast to Testosterone makes it an attractive alternative for those prone to hair loss. It's well documented that it could potentially even be more efficacious than Testosterone in certain scenarios [R]. Just a quick disclaimer, this is a hair loss prevention experiment and I by no means believe that Nandrolone is superior to Testosterone in all aspects. Simply put, when it comes to hair loss prevention, Nandrolone significantly outperforms Testosterone, which is literally the only reason I would even consider this short-term experiment. Most of you guys know I'm on TRT. I decided to swap out TRT for an equivalent weekly dosage of Nandrolone to evaluate if it can replace the physiological functions fulfilled by Testosterone with a lower incidence of hair follicle miniaturization.  How To Test If Your Deca Is Real (Or NPP) I started with NPP (Nandrolone Phenylpropionate) and swapped out Testosterone entirely. The first thing I wanted to do was to make sure my NPP was legitimate. NPP and Deca aren't commonly faked. However, the likelihood is higher with NPP that you won't be getting what you paid for, and I wanted to make sure I didn't have something like Testosterone Propionate. Initially, I actually used one of those color coded test kits. The results were not easy to interpret. While the color seemed to reflect what was indicated in the test kit, there are so many different color codes that are nearly identical to one another that I didn't feel it was an accurate way to evaluate with 100% certainty if what I had was legitimate. Logically, if you want to get accurate results, you should get a blood test to see what's really going on, which is what I did. Nandrolone Is Naturally Produced In Humans Nandrolone is a bioidentical hormone that is naturally produced in the body, albeit in trace amounts. It is hard to believe but yes, your body does in fact naturally produce some Nandrolone.  There are even precautions in certain drug tests in professional sports that have to account for the small amount of Nandrolone that's going to be found naturally in the body when they're trying to test for exogenous Nandrolone usage [R]. This is what skews standard blood test results. Always Get LC/MS-MS Tests When You Check Your Hormone Levels The only way to test if your deca is real via blood work is with a Liquid Chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) Total Testosterone test. If you don't get that specific assay, your test results are going to be wildly inaccurate. I've seen this several times now with guys who were on Nandrolone only. Their total Testosterone and free Testosterone levels appear to be elevated in the test results without even being on Testosterone at all. And for the majority of those who use Testosterone with their Deca, their blood test results show skyrocketed artificially inflated Testosterone levels. Suboptimal blood tests literally pick up 19-nortestosterone as normal Testosterone. They can't differentiate between the two. LC/MS-MS is, to quote, “a powerful analytic technique that combines the separating power of liquid chromatography with the highly sensitive and selective mass analysis capability of triple quadruple mass spectrometry.” If you're not getting this type of analysis for your hormone blood tests, it's very likely that your results are inaccurate. Obviously you should be opting for this version every time you get your Testosterone levels checked, even if you aren't using Deca or NPP. I got the LC/MS-MS analysis for my blood test and the results showed that my Testosterone was in the gutter, which is exactly what I was expecting. If your Testosterone isn't literally on the low end of female range when you're on a Deca only cycle (or NPP), your Nandrolone is probably laced with something or it's bunk, or you're getting the wrong test done. Here are my results below: Total Testosterone LC/MS-MS Test Results On Only Nandrolone  22.1 ng/dL, which falls on the low end of the female range. The normal for males is 264 to 916 ng/dL with Labcorp (it varies slightly between different labs). A man getting a 22.1 ng/dL test result indicates there's essentially no Testosterone in your body. The Nandrolone, you can conclude is likely Nandrolone as I wouldn't have a 22.1 ng/dL Testosterone level if my body was trying to restart its HPTA and I also would have felt like absolute garbage being that androgen deficient if I wasn't functioning off of an exogenous source of another androgen. Free Testosterone Test Results On Only Nandrolone This was my Free Testosterone level using direct analog enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with the exact same blood sample where I had a Total Testosterone level of 22.1 ng/dL as determined via LC/MS-MS:  The test results indicate that I have normal Free Testosterone levels, even though I actually have a Total Testosterone level lower than a hormonally deficient female. This is a perfect example of why you should only refer to sensitive assay test results. Accurate Free Testosterone testing can only be accomplished via Equilibrium Dialysis or Equilibrium Ultrafiltration. Sensitive Assay Estradiol Test Results On Only Nandrolone If you really want to get deep into it, which you should also do, you need to get an Estradiol test to see what your Estradiol levels are at because Nandrolone only aromatizes a small fraction of the amount Testosterone does. What you can expect with “therapeutic” amounts of Nandrolone are low estradiol levels. Even if you were on a massive dosage of Deca or NPP, you would still likely have low-normal Estradiol levels. A friend of mine actually was still Estradiol deficient while on a gram of Deca per week. I theorize that several of the negative health ramifications that stem from Nandrolone monotherapy could potentially be attenuated to some extent (e.g. severe HDL suppression) via exogenous Estradiol supplementation to maintain healthy physiological levels. This includes erectile dysfunction, as the true root cause of ED is almost always related to Estradiol not being kept where it should be, rather than androgen deficiency, but that is another topic for another time. To determine if you have legitimate Nandrolone, you also need to get an Estradiol test, and frankly you should really be getting one anyways just see how much you aromatize to begin with, especially if you are embarking on a deca only cycle. If you are doing a deca only cycle (or NPP) it is quite likely you will limit your potential progress and hinder your health if you force your body to operate in a state of Estrogen deficiency. The problem with the most common Estradiol test is that it is also not sensitive enough to detect Estrogen accurately in males. If you get the standard Estradiol blood test that utilizes Roche ECLIA (electrochemiluminescence immunoassay), you're going to get an inaccurate result. This was my test result on only Nandrolone using the suboptimal Roche ECLIA methodology:  The Roche ECLIA methodology indicates that I have 36.8 pg/mL Estradiol in my blood, which is a pretty standard and healthy level for men. It makes you question though, how could I possibly aromatize enough to reach 36.8 pg/mL when I only have 22.1 ng/dL Testosterone in my blood? How could I possibly have an Estradiol level not only just in range, but on the high end of normal? The reason is that this test is useless for men and will give a wildly inaccurate result. This was my Estradiol level on only Nandrolone using the superior Sensitive Assay LC/MS/MS Estradiol test.  The sensitive assay test result shows only 9.9 pg/mL. That's almost 30 pg/mL of a difference compared to the standard Roche ECLIA test. The sensitive assay Estradiol test is also done by Liquid Chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). If you're a male, and you're trying to figure out what your estradiol (E2) is at, you need to get the sensitive assay test, otherwise you will get a brutally inaccurate test result. I would have thought my Nandrolone was faked with Testosterone going off of the standard Testosterone and Estradiol test results. More importantly, in the context of a man trying to nail his TRT dosage, you can imagine the implications this kind of inaccuracy would have on his health. He could easily end up popping Aromatase Inhibitors and using nonsensical dosages of Testosterone simply because he never saw what his test results were using a sensitive assay panel. How To Test If Your Deca Is Real As you can see, with the sensitive assay versions of these tests, I actually have a tanked Testosterone level and very low Estradiol level. Obviously, to really check if this Nandrolone is Nandrolone, I had to come off of TRT for a fairly long period of time to get it all out of my system, which is consistent with the rock bottom Testosterone result. I had a minimal amount of aromatization occurring, which is also right in line with this blood test that shows that my Estradiol is on the borderline of low. Keep in mind, the male reference range for Estradiol, which is 8 to 35 pg/mL, is general. Most men will have impaired physiological function or hindered muscle building potential with less than 15-20 pg/mL in my experience. Not to mention health markers and literal bones that rely on healthy levels of Estrogen for maintenance. Typically, 30 pg/mL is where I feel best. I had to pay extra to get these sensitive assay tests, but it's worth it to see what's really going on. Otherwise, I would have totally misinterpreted what's going on. The takeaway of this is that Nandrolone can register as Testosterone in blood test results and you need to get high sensitivity LC/MS-MS hormone panels to see exactly what's going on in your body.

    "content": "The Highest Steroid Dosage Ever “Well Tolerated” In A Clinical Setting     When it comes to PEDs, the data we derive our conclusions from would ideally come from testing at the clinical level, as opposed to just anecdotes pulled off forums and bro-logs. I found the following study really interesting because to date, no other study has reported findings using a higher steroid dosage. The study is called “Effect of Methenolone Enanthate in Advanced Cancer of the Breast.” [R] The study compares 1200 mg of Primobolan per week against 300 mg of Testosterone Propionate per week. 1200 mg of Primobolan per week is the highest steroid dosage that was found to be generally well tolerated in a clinical setting. What's even more interesting about it is the study was conducted on women. If an anabolic androgenic steroid is generally well tolerated in women at such a high dosage, it's probably fair to say that it has a favorable safety profile.  Abstract of “Effect of Methenolone Enanthate in Advanced Cancer of the Breast” “Methenolone Enanthate, a synthetic, long-acting anabolic steroid, was evaluated by a randomized study in the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the breast in postmenopausal women following the protocol established by the Cooperative Breast Cancer Group. Of 27 patients receiving, Primobolan Enanthate, 48% had objective improvement. There were no improvements in 13 patients receiving Testosterone Propionate. The median duration of therapy and the median period of survival from the onset of hormone therapy to death, or present living time was greater for the responders to Methenolone Enanthate, also known as Primobolan than the nonresponders. The unusual high incidence of regression from Methenolone Enanthate therapy may be due to the massive dose employed, a defect in the method of study being employed in clinical trials, a difference that could occur by chance alone, or a significance in the biological nature of the disease in the two groups. Since the difference may indicate that Methenolone Enanthate is an effective hormone, further studies are warranted.” This study evaluates the side effect profile of a supraphysiological dose of the main endogenous androgen in men and women in comparison to a massive dosage of Primobolan. Keep in mind, Primobolan is a DHT derivative. Granted the androgenicity of Primobolan is not typical of something derived from DHT, but it's still derived from DHT nonetheless. The fact that almost half of the women administered 1200 mg of Primobolan per week in this study generally tolerated it, while none of the women in the Testosterone administered group could tolerate even 300 mg of Testosterone per week just goes to show how efficacious Primo actually is. Granted, the sample size in this study is very small, but even with that being said, if an anabolic androgenic steroid is selective enough for anabolic activity relative to androgenic activity where quadruple the dosage of Testosterone per week can be used without the majority of women experiencing horrendous side effects, that is worth exploring further. Is Primobolan A Weak Anabolic? A lot of guys write off Primo as a weak anabolic. This is something I used to do too. To be honest, I never even used it because I just always wrote it off. This was back when I used to blast and use supraphysiological dosages of steroids. I perceived it as a subpar hormone and had the same preconceived notion your common gym bro would have. “You gotta to use the Trenbolone, you gotta use the Deca,” and so on. A quick disclaimer before we continue, no dosage of anabolic steroid is “safe”. In terms of human studies and safety data though, Primobolan is one of the most science-backed, clinically safe, and most well-tolerated anabolic steroids that exists. Objectively looking at it, even in extreme applications, we have very positive feedback on it in a clinical setting, even in women who have a much lower threshold before they start experiencing limiting side effects.  The 1200 mg of Primobolan per week wasn't just for a short duration of time either. Primo was administered for 16 weeks at this massive dosage. Below is a graph of the side effect profile of the study:  Out of the participants, 48% experienced an increase in their well-being. Only 52% reported Hirustism, which is a pretty typical side effect in women who are producing more androgens than normal. The fact that 1200 mg of Primo per week still only resulted in a 52% increase in Hirustism when Testosterone and DHT levels lower than a hypogonadal old man in women with PCOS will cause it really sheds light on Primobolan's lack of androgenicity relative to other steroids. Most bodybuilders wouldn't even use 1200 mg of Primobolan. Primobolan In A Performance-Enhancing Context I'm not trying to advocate Primobolan by any means for performance-enhancing purposes. I'm just saying, if you're going to go down that route, there are steroids that are efficacious and are well tolerated by the body that would be wise to choose before you use some hormone with a complete lack of human data, or a sketchy side effect profile in the data we do have. Now, that's not to say I'm not for experimentation and explorative research. Just from a smart and logical health standpoint though, your risk profile will be lower if you choose hormones that are tried and true and have a lot of clinical testing behind them. Opt for the efficacious compounds that have more favorable safety profiles and predictable outcomes. Potential Clinical Uses For Primobolan Interestingly enough, it looks like Primobolan is actually being looked at in a clinical setting for other potential uses. For example, Primobolan metabolites are actually being looked at right now for their applications as an anti-inflammatory because they have a high level of selectivity and lower toxicity than Glucocorticoids. Primobolan is a really interesting compound. Unfortunately, Primobolan is highly faked in the market. With that being said, legitimate accurately dosed Primobolan I feel is a very underrated and efficacious hormone for the applications in which it is intended to be used.

    "content": "My Number 1 Piece Of Advice If You Are Going To Use Steroids     My number one piece of advice is something I highly doubt you've ever heard, but it's something I wish somebody told me when I was younger. I advise you heed what I write in this article before you haphazardly throw yourself into the domain of performance enhancement. The two common lines old-timers would say are:  “Don't touch steroids until you're 25 or 30 because you don't need them as young men when you have peaked natural Testosterone.” Or, “wait until you're 25 when your brain is fully developed, or you're going to get f*cked up.”  It's usually the guys who started in their teens who will preach that you absolutely need to wait until you're 25 to touch anything. I don't think anybody should be saucing in their teens, but my gauge for determining if you're ready to even consider performance enhancement is a bit different than most. The advice that's usually given is usually misguided and is based on an arbitrary minimum age.   Table of Contents ToggleWasting Your Potential By Failing To Understand Diet, Training And PharmacologyThe Effect Of Long-Term Steroid Usage On Your HealthMy Advice To Newbies If You Are Going To Use SteroidsHow Long Does It Take To Reach Your Genetic Potential Naturally?When I Hit A Sticking Point That Prevented Me From Blasting AnymoreDon't Half-Ass Your CyclesKnowing How And When To Use SteroidsRelated Wasting Your Potential By Failing To Understand Diet, Training And Pharmacology Here's my reason of why you shouldn't start using steroids, regardless of your age, until you know what you're doing in the kitchen and the gym. The reason is, you have 100,000 hair follicles on your head and you only have one set of organs. Typically, the only two things that are going to completely knock a guy off from continuing to blast steroids is going bald, or having a major health crisis. The third more unlikely outcome is that they completely lose interest in the process despite being in perfect health. However, once you are bitten by the iron bug, it's very unlikely that you're going to stop what you're doing unless something occurs that sidelines you instantly (e.g. a big stroke), or something occurs/accumulates that will severely hinder your life if you continue to pursue bodybuilding with the same intensity (e.g. male pattern baldness, cardiovascular disease progression, kidney damage, etc.). Even at that point, a lot of guys are so mentally addicted to being big that they will continue to push it past that point. There are plenty of cases of men with major health issues that still continue to push the envelope with steroids and end up having a heart attack or some other life ending complication. While not a physical health concern, hair loss can take a huge toll on mental health and there are tons of guys who accelerate hair loss to a point where they are severely balding in their 20's or 30's just because they can't stop blasting. The thing you need to realize before you start taking steroids, or any performance enhancing drugs, is that you only have so much to work with. Eventually, one of those two things is going to hit a stage where it's going to force you to either severely pull back your dosages or come off entirely. Essentially, it's just like a ticking time bomb when you take steroids that eventually you're going to have some major health ramifications or hair loss if you are consistently red lining your body with supraphysiological levels of exogenous androgens. The Effect Of Long-Term Steroid Usage On Your Health There's going to be the token few genetic elites who are able to live a long healthy life despite blasting steroids for several decades. Unfortunately, the likelihood that you're one of these genetic phenoms is low. If you are fairly average like myself, every time you blast supraphysiological amounts of androgens you are slowly but surely (or perhaps quickly depending on your genetics) ripping the hair out of your head and taxing your organs. More specifically, probably your heart, maybe your kidneys too, or maybe even your liver if you're abusing methylated orals. Each time you take steroids above a therapeutic level, you are slowly exacerbating the likelihood that you're going to get cardiovascular disease in the more near future than you would otherwise. Unfortunately, existing in the first place is a ticking time bomb where we are all going to die. Unfortunately, steroids are more than likely going to accelerate this process too.  Especially the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. Every time you blast steroids, you're unnecessarily stressing your entire body. Eventually, you're going to hit a sticking point where you have to make a choice if it's worth continuing to tax your body to gain another 5 pounds of muscle or not, or to hold on to what you already have. I actually sympathize the most with the bodybuilders who put in years of work grinding their way to a spectacular 260+ pound lean physique, as those are the guys who have forced themselves into an unsustainable position where their drug use to support that lean tissue is not only unhealthy, their sheer body weight is extremely unhealthy too. It's not a coincidence that heart disease occurrence increases in parallel with body weight, especially lean body mass weight. It's one thing accepting that you won't blast again and won't gain any more muscle, it's an entirely different mental challenge to cope with watching your body fall apart and lose 30-40+ pounds of lean mass because what you built is not sustainable long-term. My Advice To Newbies If You Are Going To Use Steroids If you are going to use steroids, you've accepted that you're putting your body in a toxic state periodically in order to gain supraphysiological amounts of muscle. If you do this long-term, you're very likely eventually going to hit a point where the constant stress on your body has accumulated and is coming back to bite you. My number one piece of advice if you are going to use steroids is to not start steroids until you have a very thorough understanding of how to train, how to eat (that doesn't just mean hitting optimal macros), and how to optimally implement pharmacology into your life in the lowest risk/highest reward way possible. The problem with this general advice is that a ton of newbies truly think they know how to diet and train when they've barely even started working out consistently. I was one of those naive kids. Dirty bulks and smashing 5×5 splits 6 days a week for hypertrophy is not the optimal way to go about things, nor is it conducive to avoiding cardiovascular stress when androgens are used concurrently. How Long Does It Take To Reach Your Genetic Potential Naturally? I truly think that within 2-3 years of perfect diet and training, your body can be primed to start to look at performance enhancement in a serious context. Hypothetically, if you had perfect diet and training principles that you consistently implemented from the get-go, you could hit a point of diminishing returns and near your genetic potential within a couple years. The problem is the likelihood that you're going to have a comprehensive knowledge of diet and training in your first few years is very unlikely. Honestly, I didn't either. Not even close. And I've done stupid amounts of research. Thousands upon thousands of hours. I can't even begin to fathom how many hours I've spent scouring the internet to know what I know now. When I Hit A Sticking Point That Prevented Me From Blasting Anymore A lot of guys look to me as an example of somebody who does their research and knows what they're talking about. Despite having poured thousands of hours into researching, I knew a fraction of what I know now when I was 3 years into lifting. I wasn't ready to start using PED's, but I did anyways because I was convinced I understood what it took to optimize my growth. I also was completely oblivious as to how to create a healthy diet model, I just thought I had to eat as much as I could and get tons of protein in. Even once I had a better understanding of how to avoid going overboard during bulk phases and how to properly prime my metabolism with calculated increases or decreases in calories, I was still negligent to adequate micronutrient intake. Having an unhealthy diet model in conjunction with steroid abuse is a perfect storm for heart disease, not to mention I was bulldozing my hair without even realizing it only to make subpar gains in muscle for at least a few of the cycles I did. Frankly, I didn't even have what I would consider a fairly thorough understanding of diet, training and pharmacology until a few years ago when I started my YouTube channel, and by then I had already reached a point where I was forced to stop blasting due to hair loss. If I could go back in time, the number one thing I would have done is wait a few more years and studied like a maniac. This is not because of my arbitrary age number or my brain not being fully developed, or thinking I'm going to stunt my growth. It's because you only have so many cycles in your tank before you hit that sticking point where something bad is going to happen which will force you to stop. In my case, it was hair loss, but it could have just as easily been a health complication had I continued down the same road for another decade. Fortunately, I had the willpower to stop in order to preserve what's on my head. The most massive regret you're going to have is if you start blasting steroids, not knowing what you're doing with diet and training fully, and you hit that point, and when you think back to all the stupid cycles you did where you didn't 100% know what you're doing, and you wasted potential muscle gain on cycles where you had subpar diet and training. As a result, now you're at a point where you can't blast again because your health is in jeopardy. Or, you also can't blast or else your hair loss is going to be so bad that you can't do anything as it's going to potentially f*ck up your head. You can't just get back that muscle that you could have had at those past cycles. You need to get the most you can out of those cycles if you're going to do them. Don't Half-Ass Your Cycles I regret the cycles I did where I wasn't 100% on point with my diet and training because I wasn't 100% sure of what I was doing. In addition to that, I wasn't in the mindset of maximizing each bulking phase before hitting that ceiling that prevented me from continuing. There was one cycle in particular where I clearly recall thinking to myself that I was going to train light and just see how much I could get out of the cycle with a complete lack of intensity in the gym. My thought process was that it doesn't matter if the cycle results in suboptimal results because I can just blast steroids again if it doesn't go that well. What I want to get across is that it's absolutely not the case. You only have so many blasts in your tank before you get to a point where you're going to have to stop. If You Are Going To Take Steroids DO NOT Waste Your Blasts! If you don't fully comprehend optimal diet, training, rest and recovery and pharmacology principles before you start, you're going to hit that ceiling one day and think back to your first few cycles (or maybe even all of them) and realize how badly you wasted muscle building potential in those cycles. You guys hear me talk often now about TRT, and how I maintain my current physique on 100 mg of Testosterone per week. I think back to my early cycles, where I was using upwards of 500, 600, 700 mg of steroids per week, and how much more I could have gained if I really knew as much as I know now and really applied it back then. If you're blasting and cruising, you're probably eventually going to end up on TRT. Even if you're not, you retain those myonuclei permanently that you gain in your youth. If you're going to be using PED's, max out every single opportunity you can because you only have so many blasts in the tank. You don't want to be that guy who thinks back on his first cycle he did of 500 mg per week of Testosterone and 30 mg of Dbol per day and barely gained sh*t because he ate like an idiot every single day, trained half-assed, and didn't know what he was doing. And you definitely don't want to be that guy who was abusing orals just to look full at high school parties on weekends and barely trains or eats. Knowing How And When To Use Steroids Most guys who use steroids don't even know how the drugs they're literally injecting into their ass works.  A few common examples of newbie mistakes:  Unnecessarily using Aromatase Inhibitors that limit fat loss and muscle accrual while concurrently smashing their lipid profile Using way too much Testosterone Throwing in orals that just overlap with the injectables they're using as their base Using drugs with nearly identical chemical structures and/or mechanisms of action alongside each other and unnecessarily exacerbating side effects while limiting muscle building potential   E.G. doing a cycle of Testosterone, Equipoise and Dianabol    If you start cycling without understanding the consequences, you might not even get to the point where you actually know what you're doing until you've already been forced to stop. Most guys don't even get to that point, and by the time they're forced to quit, they look back and wonder how others have gained so much muscle when they still look the way they do. You only have so many blasts in the tank. If you're going to use PED's, ensure that you are making the most of every single one of those blasts.

    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/how-much-does-dutasteride-increase-testosterone-levels/",
    "date": "2019-07-11T20:01:05+00:00",
    "content": "How Much Does Dutasteride Increase Testosterone Levels?     I've already written about if Finasteride lowers Testosterone levels. I felt an article on Dutasteride was justified as well. If you read the Finasteride article, you already know that Finasteride does not lower Testosterone, which is a common misconception. It actually increases Testosterone levels, as does Dutasteride. Dutasteride increases Testosterone levels to an even greater extent than Finasteride.  How 5-Alpha-Reductase Inhibitors Increase Testosterone And Estrogen Levels Once daily dosing of Propecia (Finasteride) will increase Testosterone and Estrogen levels in the body by about 15%. The reason for that is when Testosterone hits 5-alpha reductase, you now have a blockage between Testosterone being converted into DHT. Testosterone that would have otherwise converted to DHT remains as Testosterone. Now, you actually have more Testosterone than you would have otherwise. In turn, you also now have more Testosterone that will aromatize into Estrogen. The net result of that is a 15% increase in Testosterone and Estrogen. A common question is if Dutasteride does the same thing, and how much would Dutasteride increase Testosterone if it has the same mechanism of action. If you're inhibiting 5-alpha reductase more with Dutasteride than you would be with Finasteride, logically you would think, “okay, well that's going to increase Testosterone even more.” You would be correct to assume so. The Avodart highlights of prescribing information outline exactly how much Dutasteride increases Testosterone by and decreases serum DHT levels [R]. Dutasteride Effect On Serum DHT And Testosterone Levels The maximum effect of daily doses of Dutasteride and the reduction of DHT with subsequent increase in Testosterone is dose dependent and observed within one to two weeks. After two weeks of daily use, 0.5 mg of Dutasteride lowered serum DHT levels by 85% at the end of week one, and 90% at the end of week two. After one year, DHT levels had decreased by 94%. After fully being saturated in the body Dutasteride inhibits serum DHT by about 93 to 95%. The median increase in serum Testosterone for these same patients with those reductions in DHT was 19% at both one and two years 26% at three years and 22% at four years, but the mean and median levels remained within the physiological range. What that means is compared to Finasteride, Dutasteride will increase your Testosterone by approximately 4 to 11 more percent (this is based on a 0.5 mg Dutasteride dose and will vary at other dosages). Finasteride increases Testosterone by 15% and Dutasteride increases serum Testosterone concentrations by 19 to 26%. The following graph from the study “The importance of dual 5a-reductase inhibition in the treatment of male pattern hair loss: Results of a randomized placebo-controlled study of dutasteride versus finasteride” outlines the evaluation of various dosages of Dutasteride in comparison to 5 mg of Finasteride and provides some very insightful data that is often not referred to in the hair loss community. I will be delving into this study further in the next subsection of this article.  Before moving on, it should be noted that Dutasteride doesn't increase serum Testosterone levels significantly more than Finasteride, but it's notable. Scalp DHT Reduction And Subsequent Increase In Scalp Testosterone Concentrations I would be remiss to not mention the concurrent increase in scalp Testosterone concentrations that occur with Finasteride and Dutasteride use. Most get too tied up in the serum level changes of Testosterone and DHT to take note of Testosterone and DHT concentrations literally where we care about it the most… Your scalp. While most individuals will experience improved hair loss prevention outcomes with Dutasteride use relative to Finasteride, there are a minority of individuals who actually accelerate their hair loss with Dutasteride monotherapy (me included). It also explains why some individuals with aggressive hair loss don't experience any relief with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use. Scalp DHT concentrations in the Dutasteride groups were significantly suppressed compared with placebo in a dose-related manner. As with serum DHT, the 0.1-mg Dutasteride and 5 mg Finasteride groups showed a comparable degree of scalp DHT suppression (32% and 41%, respectively). Yes, you read that correctly. 5 mg of Finasteride only lowers scalp DHT by 41% (5 times the dosage prescribed for hair loss). That's what's actually occurring despite most believing they have 70% of their DHT being wiped out with 1 mg per day. Scalp DHT decreased by 51% with 0.5-mg Dutasteride and by 79% with 2.5-mg Dutasteride. Scalp testosterone levels significantly increased in all active treatment groups compared with placebo, increasing by 23%, 39%, 99%, and 222% with 0.05-, 0.1-, 0.5 and 2.5-mg Dutasteride, respectively, and 23% with Finasteride. The relationship between the mean percentage change in scalp DHT and mean change in hair count is shown in the image below.  As you can see, the efficacy of 0.1 mg of Dutasteride was roughly equivalent to that of 5 mg of Finasteride for hair loss prevention, with the 0.5 mg and 2.5 mg dosages outperforming Finasteride in efficacy measures. For most individuals, Dutasteride is more effective at preventing hair loss, purely based on DHT suppression. However, you should know by now that DHT isn't the only androgen that can cause hair follicle miniaturization. Testosterone will still wreak havoc, just to a lesser extent than DHT. 5 mg of Finasteride resulted in a 23% increase in scalp Testosterone levels with a concurrent 41% suppression of scalp DHT levels. 0.1 mg of Dutasteride resulted in a 39% increase in scalp Testosterone levels with a concurrent 32% suppression of scalp DHT levels. We can see based on this data that Finasteride actually is more efficacious at certain dosages, the problem with it is that it is so weak in comparison to Dutasteride. Ideally, we want as much DHT suppression as possible with no concurrent boosting of scalp Testosterone levels. This is why some individuals actually regress when they switch from Finasteride to Dutasteride. Their DHT is further suppressed, but their scalp Testosterone levels sky rocket and cause miniaturization that would've otherwise not occurred as dramatically had they just stayed on Finasteride. 0.5 mg Dutasteride is the daily dose most commonly used for hair loss prevention, and that dosage increases scalp Testosterone levels by 99%. I assure you, cranking your scalp Testosterone through the roof is not a good thing. In the following study assessing Testosterone's androgenicity irrespective of 5-alpha reduction to DHT it was determined that “These results demonstrate that if the prostatic testosterone content is elevated to sufficient levels, androgenic effects are induced without a requirement for an elevation in prostatic DHT content. Thus, the conversion of testosterone to DHT appears to function as a means of amplifying androgenic stimulation in the prostate” [R]. With that being said, when it comes to a trade off of suppressing 51% of scalp DHT for a 99% increase in scalp Testosterone, the net result will often be less hair loss for most individuals simply due to the high binding affinity and androgenicity of DHT relative to Testosterone. However, in individuals with aggressive male pattern baldness, this may actually shoot them in the foot and cause an even greater acceleration of hair loss if their Dutasteride use was not accompanied by a topical or systemic anti-androgen with a high enough binding affinity to antagonize Testosterone at the Androgen Receptor. For many, RU58841 sufficiently accomplishes this and cleans up the mess so to speak. For some though, having 49% of their scalp DHT left in tact with a concurrent 99% boost in scalp Testosterone and trying to combat it all with a topical anti-androgen with a very short half-life and applying it in a suboptimal manner/frequency is not going to relieve them of their continued miniaturization. I will delve into this topic further in future articles, but to the extent of how much Dutasteride will increase serum Testosterone and scalp Testosterone levels, the statistics outlined above are what you need to know and take into consideration when designing a hair loss prevention protocol.

    "content": "Sustanon TRT Prescription For Only ONE Injection Every THREE WEEKS In Europe!?     One of my buddies online Steven, sent me a pamphlet for a European Sustanon prescription. The most baffling thing about this pamphlet is the advised injection frequency at which this Sustanon is prescribed in Europe. I do consultations over Skype through MorePlatesMoreDates.com, and I'm shocked at how often I'll hear from guys who are prescribed TRT and their doctor has them injecting as infrequently as once every two weeks. There is no situation in which one shot every two weeks will result in stable blood serum concentrations. Even if you're using a long ester like Enanthate or Cypionate.  Blood Serum Concentrations Of Micro-Dosed Testosterone Vs. Bolus Dose Of Testosterone This is what blood serum concentrations of Testosterone, DHT and Estrogen look like after a small dose of Testosterone, relative to a bolus dose of Testosterone (e.g. taking your weekly TRT dosage in one fat shot).  You can clearly see how a sensical physiological dose of Testosterone results in hormone levels staying within the healthy therapeutic range, whereas with the large bolus dose of Testosterone, hormone levels skyrocket into supraphysiological territory, and then crash down until the patient's next injection. This is what happens when you use infrequent injections of Testosterone. And the more infrequent you administer, the more of a dramatic spike into unhealthy territory you launch yourself into, and the harsher of a crash you experience on the downswing. The result of this is far more aromatization than necessary which will likely lead to the unnecessary abuse of unhealthy Aromatase Inhibitors, less Free Testosterone and more Testosterone being bound up and rendered useless, as well as stark highs and lows with the potential for experiencing side effects that come both from high testosterone levels out of range, and hypogonadal symptoms on the downswing. Any large fluctuation in hormones can cause temporary shedding as well until stable levels have been reached. There's a lot of negatives associated with not having stable levels, and no positives to be frank. Most people are going to trust their doctor because that's what we've been led to believe is the correct thing to do in society. They're doctors, why would you question their judgments here, right? Trust me, you need to research this stuff yourself so you know what is going on with your body. Sustanon is a blend of the following concentrations of Testosterone esters per mL:  30 mg testosterone propionate 60 mg testosterone phenylpropionate 60 mg testosterone isocaproate 100 mg testosterone decanoate  Even if I was using Sustanon, I would still be injecting it every day, or every other day at minimum for stable blood serum concentrations. Sustanon 250 Pamphlet The pamphlet Steven sent me outlines the standard information you would find in a prescription insert. The advised administration frequency I found so absurd that an entire article was warranted. This official pamphlet for Sustanon-250 advises that the standard frequency of administration is one bolus dose every three weeks.  Basically, what would happen after that large shot is your Testosterone, Estrogen and DHT would spike into supraphysiological/unhealthily high territory, and then over the next couple weeks you would just crash into the ground, only to spike them back up at the three week mark again. Does this sound like a healthy way to live? Naturally, you would secrete 3-10 mg per day of Testosterone. Your body is not built to handle 3 weeks worth of Testosterone in one giant influx. I couldn't believe this is an approved way of administering hormone replacement. Of course, if you questioned the injection frequency to the prescribing physician, you would likely get scolded and be talked down to like you're an idiot for even bringing up the fact that they could be basing their prescriptions on dangerous and poor information. They're the smart doctor, and you're just an idiot for questioning and not trusting them. Sadly, this is very common, especially in this ever-evolving field of hormone replacement therapy where the doctors often don't even understand the difference between total T, free T, DHT, and how to manage Estradiol. Doctors Prescribing 1 mg Of Arimidex a Day I've had several people tell me about this, too. Their doctor prescribes one milligram of Arimidex every day for TRT dosages of Testosterone. I would use a milligram of Arimidex every day if I was on a gram of Test, not TRT. Unfortunately, many men prescribed this don't know actually know what the Arimidex is for because the doctor just doesn't explain it properly, or probably doesn't even understand it themselves to begin with. Just because you're on Testosterone, it doesn't mean you need an AI. If you think about it logically, the point of TRT is to replace what you produced naturally. Do most men need AI's to handle the amount of aromatization their body naturally has as a result of the Testosterone their balls naturally produce? No. Perhaps it could be the massive three weeks worth of Testosterone being administered in one mega dose that is causing this massive spike in Estrogen that would result in levels so high that an AI is warranted in the first place!? Hmm… I wonder… (I'm getting pissed just writing this). If you take a guy with therapeutic levels of Testosterone in his body and make him take 1 mg of Arimidex every day, unless he has a polymorphism in his genome that results in an absurdly high amount of aromatization (extremely rare), his Estrogen would plummet into the ground. Consequently, he'd feel terrible, have dry joints, no libido, erectile dysfunction, experience bone degradation, have hindered fat loss and overall body composition, among numerous other factors that stem from low Estrogen levels. Even after starting TRT to address their hypogonadal symptoms that made them feel like crap to begin with, they would feel even worse because their hormone profile would be even more screwed up than it was before treatment began. Not to mention AI's are horrible for your lipids and the long-term use of them will almost inevitably hinder your health in some capacity. I can't believe in the modern day with all this information around, the medical system is still so far behind. Do Your Own Research If you're looking into TRT or you're on TRT, I strongly advise you learn how this stuff works thoroughly yourself. In addition, find a progressive and open minded doctor who is up to date on the newest research and isn't prescribing medication based on what they have been taught to regurgitate 20+ years ago. Obviously this is all easier said than done, but at the end of the day, this is your health and well-being at stake, and putting the time in to figure this out if you are on TRT is well worth the time investment. It's not always the worst thing to research what your doctor is telling you before you just jump into it and assume it's correct. Occasionally, you may even save yourself from potential health ramifications.

    "content": "Chestbrah Hair Loss From Steroids Before And After     Chestbrah And Zyzz | The Shavershian Brothers Chestbrah (Said Sergeyevich Shavershian) is the brother of Zyzz (Aziz Sergeyevich Shavershian). I'm sure some of you guys know who Zyzz is.  He was one of the inspirations I had to start bodybuilding back when I was in high school. I used to watch his content and get inspired to get in the gym and build a physique. He passed away in 2011. Chestbrah has carried on the legacy of his brother after his passing. Whenever you see Chestbrah, it's hard not to get nostalgic about some of that content you saw from the old Zyzz days.  Chestbrah's Steroid Use and Hair Loss Remedy Chestbrah self admittedly has experienced an acceleration of hair loss via his use of steroids. Typically, when bodybuilders start experiencing hair loss, they will attempt a hair loss prevention protocol to mitigate further miniaturization. Most commonly they will add in Finasteride or Dutasteride, a topical anti-androgen like RU58841, a Ketoconazole shampoo, and/or Minoxidil. The typical outcome is that bodybuilders continue using the exact same highly androgenic hormones that resulted in their hair loss accelerating to begin with, and they get bulldozed with further hair loss to the point that they give up entirely and just accept balding as their fate. Frankly, if you have aggressive hair loss, you will quickly realize that there is no pharmacological intervention that will prevent you from losing your hair on androgenic steroids with incredibly high binding affinities, and the case is often the same even with what some would consider “mild” androgens. I don't think Chestbrah has aggressive hair loss at all, in fact, he's in his 30's and aside from some blatant recession, his hair didn't even look that bad considering all of the steroids he's used over the years. With that being said, miniaturization is still miniaturization, and the only option he had was to either pull WAY back on his androgen use, or pull the classic bodybuilder “I'll just let my hair loss continue and shave my head because The Rock and Jason Statham look good with it” move. Stopping steroid use sounds simple enough, but for someone who makes their living off their physique, and has a huge legacy to uphold that was literally based around aesthetics, it would be difficult for most in that position to justify discontinuing hormone use. It's a mental addiction too, and stopping your use of something that literally built your physique can be very tough for many to do. One thing I've come to learn over the years that Chestbrah has clearly realized too is that you really don't need much to sustain muscle tissue. I can hold onto my physique with 100 mg of Testosterone per week, which barely puts me on the high end of the therapeutic reference range. Could I have achieved my physique only using 100 mg of Testosterone/TRT dosages?  Probably not, but the fact remains that the amount of exogenous hormone assistance needed to sustain a foundation once the muscle has been built is a lot less than most would think. Most guys would continue blasting unnecessarily high amounts of hormones with unrealistic perceptions about how much gear they need to hold onto what they've built. One of my friends linked me to Chestbrah's Instagram story where he posted before and after pictures of what his hair looked like on blasts of very androgenic steroids relative to after he completely stopped using them cold turkey and dropped down to a lose dosage of Testosterone. Chestbrah's Instagram Story Starts at 2:27 in the video below.  I think his physique more or less looks the same even though he went from blasting heavily androgenic hormones to just a low dosage of Testosterone and SARMs. His physique might have even improved a bit from what I can tell. Now, don't misconstrue things and assume that Testosterone and SARMs are hair safe, as they can both still miniaturize hair follicles, but this is dose-dependent, genome dependent, and their inherent androgenic effect on hair follicles can be largely attenuated via pharmacological intervention. The fact of the matter is, the hormone profile necessary to sustain an aesthetic physique that women find attractive is a lot more reasonable than most assume. How Much Do You Need To Use To Look Like Zyzz Or Chestbrah? A lot of guys are out there blasting unnecessary amounts of hormones. To get a physique that's appealing to women you very likely don't need to take anything to be honest. Our perception of what a good physique is has been so unhealthily skewed by bodybuilders and fitness models on social media that we assume the bare minimum is 190 pounds shredded at 6 feet tall. The reality is that you don't need anything at all if you have half decent genetics and an immaculate diet and training program. However, for the sake of this article, we will be focusing on this topic from a bodybuilding/enhanced context Even to get that “aesthetic” look, you can use a lot less than you probably think, and I want to persuade you to lower your risk profile if your goals align with building a physique like Chestbrah, or like Zyzz. There are tons of recreational bodybuilders who don't compete using ridiculous dosages of veterinary drugs approved for horses, drugs approved for cattle, drugs not tested in humans, non-bioidentical hormones that they see promoted in forums, and they are brainwashed into thinking that these are all drugs they absolutely need to use in order to build an “aesthetic” physique. To get to 185-190 pounds shredded, you don't need to throw the kitchen sink at yourself, trust me. How Chestbrah Reversed His Hair Loss Chestbrah recently shared how he reversed all of his visible hair loss with Finasteride, Minoxidil, Nizoral, LLLT (low-level laser therapy), a hair transplant, and lowering his androgen usage.  Obviously the main factor that brought back his youthful hair line was the hair transplant, but the greatly lowered androgen usage in particular is what is sustaining his current position, prevented further loss, and probably resulted in some significant regrowth as well. All of that in conjunction with lowering his systemic androgen index significantly by dropping down to only a low dose of Testosterone made a massive difference. In addition, his Finasteride use prevents a fair bit of the 5-alpha reduction of Testosterone into DHT, which further lowers his androgen index. On top of that, his use of SARMs may serve as a makeshift systemic anti-androgen by binding to androgen receptors that would otherwise be occupied by DHT and Testosterone, which are far more androgenic.  Of course, this is all dependent on the dose that he's using, which SARMs he's using, etc.  But essentially what he's done is significantly lowered his risk profile, and it has paid off.  Granted, those with aggressive hair loss would not experience the same results as him, especially with exogenous Testosterone in their system (likely still in supraphysiological amounts), but I digress. The point of this article is less to touch on how aggressive his prevention regimen is, and more so to touch on the happy medium that can be achieved with modest amounts of anabolics, while still taking steps to minimize your risk profile. Sustaining a physique that's still fitting the ideal mold of what “aesthetics” are has proved to be just as sustainable using low dosages of Testosterone relative to high dosages of very androgenic hormones. Do I think Chestbrah could have achieved his current physique had he only used low dosages of Testosterone and SARMs from the get go? I believe so.                View this post on Instagram                      If my old 20 year old self would step into a time machine back then and see my current new self I would have not believed it was possible. I started with some of the shittiest genetics for bodybuilding. Naturally a narrow frame and skeletal structure weighing in at only 55kg’s on the left. Currently sitting at 85kg’s and 7% body fat Demi-God mode. My biggest piece of advice to all of you that follow me, enjoy the journey and trust in the process, Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither was this sickcunt you see before you. Work hard, be consistent, get your meals in, train like a fucking animal…then have the whole fitness world Mirin on your gains bruh. Goodluck my army of supporters, I believe in you all, if i did it so can you! I will lead us all into the path of aesthetic enlightenment, but the passion and fire must come from within….this simply cannot be taught. You must possess a burning desire to change and be something great, otherwise most just give up after a few years. Now which do you wanna be? A quitter or a champion? Well then you know what to do ya cheeky Kent’s ? A post shared by  Said Sergeyevich Shavershian (@said_sergeyevich) on May 3, 2019 at 2:33pm PDT   \n\n He weighs 185 pounds. You don't need to be on Testosterone with Tren and Masteron to look great and weigh 185. To be clear, I'm not trying to fear monger steroid use.  If you want to get to 260+ lean then yes, your requirements will be a lot more demanding than someone like Chestbrah. However, if you are someone like me who's just trying to maximize your aesthetic appeal to feel good about yourself and be confident, you don't need to be using steroids with high levels of androgenicity, or abusive dosages of steroids in general. I used to use 200 mg of Testosterone per week as my “TRT” to sustain my physique because I was afraid of lowering my dose below that. I truly believed I needed 200 mg of Testosterone to hold onto my 215 pound 10% body fat frame. That dosage kept my Testosterone levels supraphysiological at all times, and was beyond unnecessary. Eating at maintenance while on 200 mg of Testosterone yielded no additional muscle retention that hasn't been accomplished with the 100 mg of Testosterone Propionate per week I use now. However, my hair loss risk profile is substantially lower using 100 mg per week. I was using double the dosage I needed just because I truly thought I would whither away into nothingness on less than 200 mg of Testosterone. To be frank, if you're not 240+ lean, you VERY likely don't need 200 mg+ Testosterone per week to hold onto what you have. I have no idea what Chestbrah's Testosterone dosage is, but his drastic reduction in his androgen use has clearly proved to help attenuate his progression of androgenic alopecia, and the lower his androgen index gets, the lower his risk profile will continue to get. Just be aware of your actual limitations and keep things realistic. Don't go overkill and burn your hair out, burn your health out, or do things that are unnecessary to achieve something that could have otherwise been achieved with less drug abuse, and more training consistency, diet, and patience. I could have ended up exactly where I'm at now with way less than I used, but with more hair on my head. And so could Chestbrah. He likely could have avoided needing a hair transplant entirely if he was more calculated about his use in the past. If you're going to use PED's and your goal physique is someone with a very realistically achievable physique like Zyzz or Chestbrah, don't go over the top with unnecessary drugs and dosages or you will regret it in the future.

    "content": "Using T3 While Bulking To Stay Lean – A Good Or Bad Idea?     Don't Take T3 If You Aren't Hormonally Deficient There is no point of taking T3 while you're bulking unless you have a deficient thyroid to begin with. Even in that situation, you would also need to verify via blood work that you have an inability to sufficiently convert T4 into T3. The first thing you're going to get prescribed when you have insufficient thyroid production is most likely Synthroid (the most commonly prescribed brand of T4). In some rare instances, you may be a poor converter of T4 to T3, which is the active thyroid hormone, the hormone we care about. If you can prove that to your physician, then in that scenario, you would probably get a prescription of T3 if your doctor isn't completely incompetent. Often times, these prescriptions would just be a bandaid for an underlying issue causing your deficient thyroid production, or subpar conversion rate though. Something as simple as a Selenium deficiency can prevent you from converting T4 to T3 in your body properly [R]. Sometimes it can be a lot more complicated though and be related to an autoimmune reaction to something so obscure that you need to play detective and thoroughly learn how your body works in order to find the root cause.  Staving Off Fat Loss In A Calorie Surplus With T3? For recreational use, T3 during a bulk doesn't serve a productive purpose. There are arguments on internet forums that go back and forth about how T3 increases protein synthesis, keeps you leaner, and so on. At the end of the day, T3 is not tissue specific and doesn't discriminate when it comes to burning through stored energy. It doesn't care if it's ripping through muscle or stored fat, and it will gladly tap into your stored muscle protein and put your body in a catabolic state if you aren't careful. If you're trying to eat in a calorie surplus and you're stuffing your body with nutrient-dense foods to reach a very specific caloric allotment each day, taking additional T3 at a supraphysiological dose is just eating away at that calorie surplus (and potentially muscle tissue) for no additional benefit. You're basically just wasting the food, so to speak. The only purpose T3 serves is if you have insufficient thyroid function that is preventing your metabolism from working properly during that bulk. In that scenario you would use T3. However, if you have adequate T3 production in the first place, you don't need additional T3 to keep you lean while you're in the offseason. What keeps you lean is starting your offseason with an insulin sensitive shredded physique and bulking up lean slowly and patiently, not taking extra drugs to stay shredded while you grow. You're still going to get fat on T3 no matter how much you take if you eat a sh*tty diet, or you're insulin resistant. I would actually argue that using T3 during a bulking phase could actually hinder your physique more than help it, as you're limiting the very muscle accrual process that will be what determines how fast your metabolism is at rest to begin with. The more muscle you have, the more fat you burn without even moving your body. The more you hinder the muscle growth process, the harder you're making it on yourself to prime your metabolism for getting shredded, and an even worse potential scenario could be that you end up in a worse position than you started by eating away at your muscle and slowing your metabolism down as a result. Should You Use T3 While On GH (Growth Hormone)? High doses of GH for prolonged periods of time may downregulate your thyroid production. It's commonly assumed in the bodybuilding community that you need to take T4 with your GH. In actual practical application, it often doesn't seem to be the case. However, there are some individuals who do experience a downregulating effect while on GH. If you experience the latter scenario, you would be wise to explore exogenous T4 replacement, and then your body would convert what it needs from that T4 into T3 to reach an adequate level of active thyroid hormones.  The only situation on GH in which you would need to use T3 instead of T4 during a bulk would be if you're an suboptimal converter of T4 into T3. In my opinion, T3 only serves a useful purpose in a bulk if you're a poor converter of T4 to T3, and you actually need it as a result of: A. A genetic predisposition B. Using other drugs that are suppressing your thyroid hormone production C. An autoimmune disease that you can't figure out how to treat (I strongly advise you find the root of this ASAP instead of masking the symptoms with exogenous thyroid hormones) I'm a big fan of sporadic T3 use for cutting, but not for bulking unless you are hormonally deficient.

    "content": "Could I Have Achieved My Physique With Only TRT Dosages?     If I could go back in time, could I have achieved my current physique with only TRT dosages? This will depend on a few factors. It's becoming more and more common to see bodybuilders who are transitioning to a more health-conscious approach talk about how they can maintain their physique on very low dosages. Some of them even preach that anyone using more than an HRT dosage of Testosterone is stupid, or using steroids before you turn 25 is idiotic, or that a low of a dose of androgens is all that is needed to achieve massive gains in muscle mass and every one in this day and age is using too much. I realize that I've fallen into this trap to some extent because I frequently refer to my TRT regimen and elaborate on how I'm constantly trying to lower my dosage to achieve more optimized health markers. I'm past the blasting phases of my life at this point. I realize now that the way this message comes across can be a bit misguiding though, despite how transparent I am about exactly what I'm doing.  The fact is, most bodybuilders who have impressive physiques who “just use TRT” will constantly tell you about how low their dosage is and show off that they can retain such a great physique with therapeutic levels of androgens, but what they won't tell you is that it took them years of blasting supraphysiological amounts of androgens to actually build that foundation of muscle.    Table of Contents ToggleGenetics And Testosterone LevelsWhat Exactly Is “Therapeutic” TRT?Natural Vs Enhanced Testosterone LevelsRealistic Expectations For Your Hormone ProfileFake Naturals Vs Fake TRT'ersThe Performance-Enhancing Advantage Of TRTRelated Genetics And Testosterone Levels Is it possible to achieve my physique with just therapeutic TRT dosages or high-normal natural hormone production? Short answer, yes, if you are genetically gifted. Could I have achieved this same physique just by having a 800 ng/dL testosterone level year round since I started lifting? No. My genetics are fairly average. I have some body parts that are somewhat genetically gifted and others that are blatantly genetically lagging. I'm also not a hyperresponder to androgens. This is pretty typical, and puts me somewhere in the average genetic territory. I'm not really an outlier on either side of the spectrum, I'm just pretty average. I would assert that for another guy with average genetics, they would also not be able to build my level of a physique without exogenous hormones. There are genetic outliers that will have a natural Testosterone level barely above mid-range and still have more muscle than me though. This is purely the result of genetics. In the process of building the physique that I currently have, I do think I overdid with some of the dosages I used. Granted, what I took was nowhere near the realm of what would be considered high dosages by modern standards, but in hindsight knowing what I know now, it was more than I needed for my size. For example, my first cycle was 500 mg of Testosterone Enanthate. What Exactly Is “Therapeutic” TRT? A popular topic of debate in the bodybuilding community is what really is a therapeutic dosage of Testosterone. There are men using as much as 300 mg of Testosterone per week and claiming that it is still within the natural range, and there are men micro-dosing as low as 6 mg of Testosterone Propionate per day with an insulin pin to replicate natural endogenous secretions. I'm sure there are some who use even less than that, and there are definitely men using more than that too, but this is the general range that I see most commonly in our community. I've discussed this several times in the past and elaborated on the reasons why someone legitimately on accurately dosed Testosterone can administer upwards of 200 – 300 mg per week and still have Testosterone levels in range. In almost all cases, an individual who has an in range Total Testosterone and Free Testosterone level simultaneously while using that much Testosterone is guilty of administering their Testosterone in large volumes infrequently (e.g. one shot per 7 – 10 days of 200 – 300 mg Testosterone Cypionate).  There are other less common scenarios where genetic polymorphisms can result in suboptimal sex hormone metabolism and massive amounts of aromatization or 5-alpha reduction, but the most common scenario is infrequent administration. When these individuals get their blood drawn during a downswing of their hormones, they may get a test result showing that they're in the reference range, but the issue is that for a portion of time between their infrequent shots they actually had supraphysiological androgen levels, and unhealthy levels of aromatization. In addition, most men who do get blood work still don't pay the extra money to get high sensitivity testing done (or aren't aware of LC/MS/MS testing to begin with), and instead go with the cheap assays that can be wildly inaccurate. The following graph depicts Testosterone blood serum concentrations after administering a small dose of Testosterone in comparison to administering weekly TRT in one large bolus dose.  As you can see, the micro-dose group experienced a modest spike in hormone concentrations, with a more levelled off downswing as the hormone works its way out of the system, and the bolus dose group actually spikes their Testosterone and Estrogen level far above the therapeutic range for several days. The end result of frequent micro-doses is ultimately the avoidance of this massive hormone spike, stable blood serum concentrations, and an accurate blood test result when it comes time to see where your Testosterone, Estrogen and DHT are actually at. With a weekly bolus dose, you could be using far too high of a dosage and not even realize it, or too low of a dosage conversely if you are getting your blood test too close to your last bolus dose administration. With bro-science bodybuilder TRT of 250 – 300 mg per week, yeah, I probably could have achieved this physique on just “TRT”. However, that would not be representative of what true therapeutic TRT is in my opinion. Natural Vs Enhanced Testosterone Levels I believe the line of therapeutic dosages is crossed when your total testosterone exceeds 1100 ng/dL, or your free testosterone exceeds 250 pg/mL at any one point of the week. The higher you go with those numbers above the reference range, the higher risk you are for developing cardiovascular disease. Obviously this varies from lab to lab as they have wildly different reference ranges, but typically, the majority of labs will not have a reference range exceed 1100 ng/dL total testosterone and 250 pg/mL free testosterone. I would venture to guess that there are very few naturals out there that walk around with 1100 ng/dL Testosterone levels. A study conducted in 2017 evaluated the Testosterone levels of 9054 healthy nonobese men to determine a harmonized normal reference range in a healthy nonobese population of European and American men between 19 – 39 years old. By extrapolating the data, I found that of the 1669 men 39 years or younger included in the data, only 5 of them had a Total Testosterone level that exceeded 1000 ng/dL [R]. None of them exceeded 1100 ng/dL, and the highest Testosterone level was in a man with a result of 1073 ng/dL. For healthy men without obesity aged 19 – 39 years old, the researchers reported that the 50th percentile was 531 ng/dL, the 95th percentile was 852 ng/dL and the 97.5th percentile was 916 ng/dL.  The average male produces 3 to 10 mg of Testosterone per day with no ester attached to the molecule. That's pure 3 to 10 mg of Testosterone per day. Obviously, if you have 200 mg per week of Testosterone Enanthate, you have to account for the ester weight and how much bioavailable hormone is leftover after cleaving off the ester, which is approximately 140 mg. If I had maybe the top end of that 3 to 10 mg of full usable Testosterone year-round, perhaps I could have gotten my physique now, but I don't think so. Realistic Expectations For Your Hormone Profile If I could go back in time, I would have used more reasonable and “safe” dosages for my first cycle, and each cycle thereafter. I probably could have achieved what I have with far less, and as a result I likely would have experienced less side effects like hair loss. I'm also not massive by any means. I'm sitting at maybe 215 to 220 pounds right now at 10% body fat. I can hold on to this much muscle with a therapeutic dosage of Testosterone well within the reference range. Could I have built it with that same dosage in the reference range though? I don't think so. Another guy with better genetics could have, no doubt about that, but they would be a genetic outlier. The majority of my muscle tissue was built during all those big bulk phases I did in my earlier 20's, and I essentially just maintain and refine it now. I've used as much as 1.5 grams of total androgens per week for a short stint at my highest level of abuse. I probably didn't even need 1/2 that much to achieve what I have now, but the fact remains that I simply could not be sitting at 215 – 220 lean with my genetics had I not done some of those blasts in my past. There are probably quite a few naturals who watch my channel who have better physiques than me without even touching anything, but they are the minority, and this article is meant to clarify what was realistic for my own body and my own genetics. I want to be transparent and not have young guys haphazardly jumping on TRT when they don't need to thinking that it will get them to the next level. Fake Naturals Vs Fake TRT'ers I feel like I should coin a new term to label the guys who lie about their hormone replacement therapy. Fake naturals, or fake nattys is reserved for those who use steroids but lie about it entirely. Fake TRT'ers (perhaps I'll come up with something more catchy than that at some point) are the guys who use supraphysiological amounts of androgens, or even high-normal amounts, and imply that they didn't need more than a young man's natural ballsack production to build their physique. As the bodybuilding community starts to migrate away from getting as massive as possible and starts to favor more relatable, aesthetic physiques reminiscent of Frank Zane, as well as focus on health more, there are a number of individuals who will preach about all the good practices they have now, but will never talk about their past drug abuse. If you see a fake TRT'er walking around at 240+ pounds lean who has transitioned from bodybuilding to a health conscious and longevity focused lifestyle, they will ramble on and on about how you need to be careful with your health, get such and such health markers checked, not take high dosages of hormones because they aren't necessary to build muscle, and so on. What he's not going to tell you about is the 1000 – 3000 mg per week of gear he blasted in his past. What he will tell you about is the 70 – 125 mg per week of TRT they run now with “anti-aging dosages of GH“. It's almost like a toned down version of guys being fake nattys and selling supplements to unknowing teenagers. It's deluding people into having a skewed perception of what is realistic and what isn't. I'm trying to put it out there in this article and just be as transparent as I can with you guys. You probably know by now I'm more health-focused than I used to be, and it shows in my content. I have become progressively more longevity focused, and far less focused on just building lots of muscle. I often preach using the lowest dosage you can possibly get away with that yields results, not only because the body has counteracting mechanisms in place, but also for health reasons. If you can gain 10 pounds of muscle using 300 mg of Testosterone per week and have acceptable blood work still, or you can gain 13 pounds of muscle using 600 mg of Testosterone per week and have horrible blood work, you can venture to guess which option I would choose now. What I want to make abundantly clear though is that TRT is not supposed to be something that will enhance your current physique unless you are hypogonadal, or literally naturally deficient. There are so many bodybuilders out there now preaching low dosages, preaching about how little they use while simultaneously walking around at 250+ pounds lean, preaching how they sustain what they have with just therapeutic TRT (me included), that I need to make clear that haphazardly going on TRT when you don't need it will not improve your physique, because replicating what your balls already produce naturally will not elevate your physique to an enhanced environment more conducive to building muscle. Supraphysiological levels of muscle are built when the physique has a supraphysiological amount of hormones present. Simply replicating a 800 ng/dL testosterone level with exogenous TRT will change nothing in your physique though if you already produce it naturally. Regardless if your favorite fitness icon claims they only use _ dosage of Testosterone and they can hold all the muscle they built over their bodybuilding career, I assure you that they didn't get to 250 pounds shredded by using 70 mg of Testosterone Propionate per week. Yes, they can probably just manage to hold onto it, but they sure as sh*t didn't build 100 pounds of muscle on their frame by synthetically replicating what a set of genetically gifted testicles is capable of naturally producing. The point of therapeutic TRT is literally to maintain what you should be producing naturally as a young man, not to be on a mini-cycle year round intermittently week to week between infrequent administrations, and legitimate therapeutic levels shouldn't be misconstrued as something that will pack on supraphysiological blast-like amounts of muscle. The Performance-Enhancing Advantage Of TRT A lot of guys look at TRT like some enhancement practice to get to the next level. If you're actually doing it the way it's intended to, it should just be replacing what has down-regulated over the years. Obviously, when you're in a cutting phase, you're in a state of deprived energy, you will inevitably have a performance-enhancing advantage regardless if your levels are in the reference range simply due to the fact that your body being in a state of deprived energy does not impact blood serum concentrations achieved with exogenous injections of synthetic hormones, but that's besides the point. In general (not in a cutting context), you shouldn't get a performance-enhancing advantage if you are a natural with high free testosterone and then you start pinning TRT just to achieve the same thing. At that point, it doesn't make logical sense, and there's a lot of young guys with perfectly fine Testosterone production perceiving TRT like it's a full blown performance enhancement practice to gain lots of muscle. To be clear, I'm not advocating blasting supraphysiological dosages of androgens, but I want to be clear about what is realistic and not to delude people when I talk about my TRT protocol.  I see comments all the time baffled that I use as little as I do and can sustain my physique. The fact is, I didn't achieve my physique with baby amounts. If you would like to explore this topic further, I strongly advise you check out the article I wrote regarding how much muscle mass different increments of Testosterone doses has shown to build. This comparison took place in a clinical setting with controlled parameters, and compared 5 different increments of weekly Testosterone dosages against each other to determine exactly how much fat-free mass each dosage increment builds in young healthy men. It is the best study to date that I am aware of that illustrates the dose-response relationship Testosterone has on the accrual of fat-free mass.

    "content": "Should You Use An Oral Steroid During Your Bulk Cycle?     “Should you use an oral steroid during your bulk cycle” has been a commonly asked question in the bodybuilding community. It's not a yes or no answer. With that being said, the entire point of this post is to delve into the very common scenario I see guys put themselves in where they actually limit their progress by using additional drugs.  Methylated Oral Steroids Can Cause Loss Of Appetite Let's just say hypothetically that you're on 500 mg of Testosterone, 400 mg of Deca, and feel the urge to throw in a fat dose of Anadrol. Anadrol, and most other oral steroids are 17α-alkylated.  This means that they feature an alkyl group in order to make it through the liver without being destroyed. These steroids would just break down and be rendered useless if they weren't 17α-alkylated to begin with. As you would logically assume, intentionally taking a drug that is meant to be liver toxic just so it survives and is bioavailable can have some negative consequences on your health and well-being. One of the most obvious side effects that can occur while using liver toxic orals is a huge reduction in appetite. The Most Common Factor Preventing A Bodybuilder From Gaining Muscle Truth be told, the number one limiting factor of a bodybuilder's progression is typically his diet. How much can one eat, relative to the amount of drugs he's taking in, relative to his training intensity and volume. If you're not eating enough, you're not going to grow, period. What I've seen from a lot of guys is they throw in Anadrol for the first four weeks. After that, they swap to another oral like Dbol, and then they swap to something else. Even though they're on all these drugs that are supposedly super great mass building bulkers, they're not eating enough so they don't grow. The reason is that their appetite is crushed because they're walking around feeling toxic all day. If you're not eating enough food you're not going to grow regardless if you're on 100 mg of Anadrol or not. This is something you have to keep in mind. There's No Perfect Steroid Cycle Often, these same guys who abuse orals in the offseason and don't eat enough would be growing like weeds if they just didn't take an oral steroid in the first place and stuck to a proper diet. A trap many men fall into is they get into this obsessive mindset where they just feel like they need certain drugs in their cycle to check off every box that would equate to what most would consider the perfect cycle. You have guys thinking “I need my Test, I need my 19-Nor, I need my GH, and I need my Insulin, and I need a strong oral.” By having every pathway of growth checked off that they feel is important, they are more comfortable going into a cycle feeling like they're making the most out their time investment. However, sometimes these same pathways of growth can lead to side effects that hinder your overall progress indirectly. Let's say you're using pre-workout insulin. You think that, “Oh, I'm using pre-workout insulin, I'm going to become a monster.” Now let's just say that hypothetically you're a dosage that forces you to slam a bunch of liquid calories in the middle of your workout in order to prevent yourself from going hypo, and because you want to “shuttle the nutrients” into the muscle better. As a result, you have a crappy workout because you're bloated and feel like crap from slamming 2-3 Vitargo shakes with Hydrolyzed Whey and other powders in them over the course of your peri-workout window. Is that insulin helping or hindering you? A better example I see more often is GH abuse. Let's just say you can get away with a few IUs of GH per day and have solid fasting blood glucose levels still and then you decide to crank the GH dosage as high as you can because you heard that the best dosage of GH is as much as you can afford to take. You bump the dose to 10 IUs per day, and as a result, you are running sky high blood glucose levels and you're tired all day long which prevents you from getting a good workout in. It also forces you to slam a stimulant dense pre-workout supplement each day just so you can muster the energy to drag your ass to the gym to get a half-assed workout in. Is the high dosage of GH really helping you at that point, or hindering you? I would argue the latter. Being OCD About The Anabolic Matrix Don't fall into the trap of feeling like you are wasting your time if you don't have every box checked off. There are guys who are so OCD about having certain compounds in their cycles that they will continue taking a drug even if they feel like sh*t on it and can't eat enough to grow. They struggle to stick to their diet and they can barely even get a clean meal down. This often leads to substitutions of clean food for unhealthy crap just to hit daily calorie goals, or just not hitting calorie goals at all and not growing. They stay on the drugs just because they can't accept the fact that they won't have a part of the anabolic matrix checked off. At the end of the day, sometimes you have to just say f*ck the plan. You have to do what's best for you because not everything that works for one guy is going to work for another guy. Sometimes less is more.

    "content": "Can You Maintain Minoxidil Grown Hair After Stopping Minoxidil?     A lot of you guys have asked me if you can maintain Minoxidil grown hair after you've stopped using Minoxidil. Can you maintain it with Finasteride, or another hair loss prevention treatment? The harsh reality is that the hairs that you grow via Minoxidil use are 100% dependent on the Minoxidil. There are a few caveats to this, as there are very obscure drugs with similar mechanisms of action which could potentially maintain that same level of circulation in the scalp, but Minoxidil is by far the most readily available, clinically studied, and efficacious method of achieving this. With all that being said, Minoxidil isn't side-effect free, in fact, it's one of the most side effect ridden treatments out there, but I digress. Even if your hair density improved by 10%, by using Minoxidil, that hair is only there because of the increased circulation to the area. You can't maintain that if you stop using Minoxidil, nor can you maintain it with things that operate via a totally separate mechanism of action.  Minoxidil Does Not Prevent Hair Loss One important thing to note is that Minoxidil does not prevent hair loss. Let's just say you take Minoxidil for five years and your density improved by 10%. With your normal progression of androgenic alopecia, let's just say you would have otherwise experienced a loss of 10% density instead (this number will vary depending on genetic predisposition, hormone profile, diet, etc.). If you would've otherwise lost 10% density, and you improve your density by 10% with Minoxidil, you're essentially just breaking even and everything appears to be stable. If you dropped the Minoxidil, what would happen is the density of your hair would drop to that minus 10% baseline that you would have been at otherwise if you hadn't taken the Minoxidil. That's just how it works. All of these hairs grown from Minoxidil use are Minoxidil dependent hairs, so regardless of what else you're taking (in almost all scenarios), these hairs are dependent on your application of Minoxidil to thrive. You Can't Maintain Minoxidil Grown Hair If You Stop Using It Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Minoxidil. It does what it does well, yes I agree with that. For many, it can be an excellent addition to their hair loss prevention regimen and they can go through life side-effect free. For me personally, it bloats me significantly and I look worse when I use it. Minoxidil is one of my last resorts, especially because it is a growth agonist and does not actually address the root of the issue causing androgenic alopecia in the first place. It doesn't block or inhibit Testosterone or DHT induced miniaturization whatsoever. The mechanism of action is purely growth stimulating. There are far more important things to address like the DHT and androgen levels than trying to stimulate growth before you've even protected yourself and giving yourself the foundation of hair loss prevention. Blocking or inhibiting androgens should be your number one priority. If you're on Minoxidil and you grow hair courtesy of Minoxidil, that hair will be dependent on the Minoxidil to survive. When it comes down to if you're going to take Minoxidil or not, I feel like it should be after your foundation is set and you have a baseline of thorough DHT protection in place at minimum, and if your hair loss is more aggressive then DHT as well as Testosterone.

    "content": "Does GH (Growth Hormone) Cause Hair Loss? | Androgenic Alopecia Vs Temporary Shedding     No, growth hormone (GH) cannot cause permanent hair loss. However, it can cause temporary shedding. Let's clarify the difference between androgenic alopecia and temporary shedding. Androgenic alopecia, or male pattern baldness, is the acceleration of hair follicle miniaturization facilitated via androgen receptor activation, which is what most guys experience throughout their lives. Shedding is often misinterpreted as permanent loss. Temporary shedding is caused when a large percentage of scalp hairs are shifted into the shedding phase of the hair growth cycle. This life cycle is fairly long as your hair goes through a growth phase and eventually completes the life cycle and falls out of your head. However, certain deficiencies, autoimmune triggers, allergens, or hormone fluctuations can cause a premature shift of hairs in the anagen phase to the telogen phase.  GH Hair Loss And Shedding Human growth hormone, as you may know, has a lot of anti-aging benefits when it comes to complexion, hair, skin, nails, etc. (to a point, this benefit is often massively exaggerated). Then why have some people reported hair loss from it? Here's basically the lowdown on it. Human growth hormone will more than likely improve the quality of your hair if you don't have top tier endogenous secretion. It's going to improve how fast it grows and perhaps even prolong the anagen phase, which indirectly is going to increase overall visual density. My personal hair loss prevention regimen has often included MK-677 which is a GH secretagogue, or low dosages of synthetic GH injections. I've utilized both to stimulate a healthier rate of growth, which indirectly offsets some loss of density I had in my own hair, and it makes a noticeable difference. The mechanism of action behind GH causing hair loss in some individuals boils down to the simple fact that hormonal fluctuations can trigger telogen effluvium. When you introduce something hormonal into your system that causes a temporary imbalance (your body has to adjust to and acclimate and get back to a state of hormonal homeostasis), it can cause shedding. Non-Androgenic Triggers That Can Cause Shedding There are plenty of triggers that are completely non-androgenic that can cause shedding. There are some people with autoimmune disorders and allergies that cause hair to just fall out of their head. Chris Deoudes and I have both personally experienced increased shedding from Melanotan II usage. Chemotherapy can also cause all of your hair to fall from your head. Essentially, if you use something that your body just doesn't agree with, it can cause a shed. For example, a change in your hormonal profile or a chemical that alters your microbiome significantly. There's a number of things that can cause shedding. Take hypothyroidism as a perfect example. Hypothyroidism causes your hair to fall out. Is that permanent? No, it's not. If you're using too much exogenous T3 to treat your hypothyroidism you can cause massive amounts of shedding too. There are tons of things that cause shedding that have nothing to do with androgenic alopecia/male pattern baldness. GH Does Not Miniaturize Hair Follicles Hair follicles are not inhibited by GH and IGF-1 like they are with androgens. As there is no miniaturization occurring, permanent loss via GH administration would be impossible. Especially when considering the fact that the GH/IGF-1 pathway is partially what is responsible for optimal hair growth to begin with. When you first start taking GH, you may experience a big shed. This shed should be short-lived though, pending one was consistently using the same dosage with a fixed administration frequency. Achieving stable hormone concentrations is one of the main keys in preventing unnecessary shedding phases.

Over the years, Trenbolone has evolved into such a commonly used hormone that it is seen by many as “tried and true,” and a necessity to build an amazing physique. This drug is now seen as a staple in a bodybuilders' regimen, and is even incorporated into year round use by some. I'm shocked at how heavily this drug has become abused. Especially by guys who frankly do not need it. The Trenbolone dosage that I see guys my size using, or even guys smaller than me using is nonsensical.  Trenbolone Dosage For Cattle  If you take a look at the official product page for Finaplix-H, which are the original pellets of Trenbolone still used to this day in cattle; the dosage given to a giant cow to bulk it up is 200 mg.  That's one 200 mg Trenbolone implant for one cow. Somehow, we've ended up with 200 pound bodybuilders (who are humans, not cows) that are using 400 – 600 mg of Tren per week on their first cycle. It's just complete nonsense. This drug has never been clinically tested on humans before. Even the data on animal models is not promising in terms of its side effect profile whatsoever. Trenbolone Dosage For Humans (Parabolan) Pharmaceutical grade Trenbolone used to be produced for human use by Negma Laboratories under the brand name Parabolan, but there were no published human trials. It was pulled from the market in 1997 and is no longer approved for human use. The Trenbolone dosage used in a clinical setting for humans was purportedly three 76 mg Parabolan ampules per month. This equates to approximately 50 mg of active hormone per ampule after cleaving off the ester. This had a front load period of three Parabolan ampules over the first 15 days, followed by a maintenance phase of one Parabolan ampule every 10 days thereafter. The Trenbolone Dosage Protocol In Humans Via Negma Laboratories (Parabolan)  114 mg Trenbolone Hexahydrobenzylcarbonate (75 mg active hormone) per week for the first two weeks 76 mg Trenbolone Hexahydrobenzylcarbonate (50 mg active hormone) per 10 days thereafter   Opt For Safer Alternatives Than Tren There are far safer alternatives should you go the performance-enhancement route that would yield formidable muscle gain. Sure, you're not going to get the same recomposition benefits pre-contest, and perhaps you can justify its place in the final stretch of extreme contest preparation circumstances. I can see why guys would want to implement it, and I've had my fair share of using it before when I was a lot more oblivious to its potential adverse effects (years ago). The main issue stems not from its acute use pre-contest, rather, from the dosages and durations of time it is being used in nowadays for nearly every cycle. It is literally the staple drug some guys are using in every single cycle they run nowadays, and the dosages are absurd. Of all the steroids you could abuse, Trenbolone is the one you want to stay away from the most. Minimize your use of it is my advice. You don't need the same dose a cow uses to bulk. I see guys who are barely my size using 400 mg of Trenbolone in the off-season to try and gain mass thinking it is a conservative dosage. There are even guys who jump to Tren before even trying hormones that have dozens of human trials. And worse, the guys who jump to Tren before even using bioidentical hormones. Buddy, it's your first or second cycle and you're using Tren? Don't throw the kitchen sink at yourself when it is completely unnecessary. Look Into Bioidentical Hormones Instead At least look at bioidentical hormones first, and things that you can predict with great accuracy what the side effect profile is going to be. Make sure it has clinical data on humans and your body actually understands what it is. Using Trenbolone intended for cattle at dosages higher than what is given to the cows is not a sustainable practice. We have no idea what this drug is going to do in the human body, so it would be wise to avoid it as much as possible. Does Trenbolone Cause Alzheimer's?  It's not a coincidence that bodybuilders get more mental instability issues on Tren as opposed to other drugs. Obviously, aggression potentially comes with any androgen. If you have an aggressive personality, increasing your androgen index is going to exacerbate it. But Trenbolone in particular makes guys go a little crazy. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about here. It's not a coincidence that the animal models that had Trenbolone administered to them experienced degraded cognitive outcomes.   Male rats given Trenbolone injections had Aβ42 (amyloid-beta-42) accumulate in their brains [R]. Alzheimer's disease is believed to be caused by the accumulation of the β-Amyloid peptide. While there has been no human trial to assess if this occurs in humans (and there probably never will be), I think it is best that we assume the worst when we see data like this. Trenbolone As A Muscle Builder Despite the massive hype, I don't even think Trenbolone is a great muscle builder in the offseason. There are hormones that work just as well, if not much better than Tren in a muscle building context. Nothing will recomp the body like Tren, but when it comes to pure lean tissue accrual, there are hormones that are just as good, if not superior in that context. There are also hormones that will produce less dramatic results in the short-term, but are far more sustainable to use and have significant amounts of clinical data. It makes sense to me how Tren usage could be justified to some for acute usage pre-contest, but even then the dosage still needs to be more reasonable. Trenbolone should be reserved as a hardcore competition-only drug in my opinion. Most of the guys reading this article aren't competing in intense high-level bodybuilding competitions. Even for your first regional show, you don't need to be using a cattle drug. Trust me, I used to think that, “Oh, everyone is on Tren. It's the end-all-be-all. It's the godsend of bodybuilding.” Honestly, it's really not. It produces great physiques, but so do other drugs that are likely much safer, and at least have human data we can refer to so we know what we are getting ourselves into. There is no steroid that is safe, all androgens will increase cardiovascular disease risk in a dose-dependent manner, but the least we can do is stick to compounds we know won't give us completely avoidable diseases down the line. I would just advise you guys to be very cautious about your use of it. I see guys reporting their cycles on social media and talking about using a Trenbolone dosage higher than what is administered to cattle when they're 190 pounds on stage. They could have gotten away with much less, or even avoided Tren entirely, and still looked exactly the same. Final Thoughts On Trenbolone Through my experience with Tren, I would advise you to be very cautious with its use, especially when you actually look into the clinical data on it. Some are shocked to see that this isn't a drug that's had any studies on humans. There are a lot of guys out there who think that just because this hormone has been used in the bodybuilding community for so long now and was previously prescribed for musculoskeletal degenerative diseases that it must have copious amounts of safety data. This couldn't be further from the truth. There's more human data on most research chemicals that most guys scoff at then there is on Trenbolone, or even a myriad of other steroids commonly abused in the bodybuilding community. There are a lot of drugs that don't really make sense why they're even in the bodybuilding world to begin with (*cough* EQ *cough*), but I will save that for another post. If you are deadset on using Tren no matter what anybody says or what you read, just keep in mind that a little goes a long way, and you very likely don't need to be using a Trenbolone dosage greatly exceeding what is being administered to cattle.

    "content": "David Sinclair Supplements For Anti-Aging – What He Takes & Why     David Sinclair is a professor of genetics at the forefront of anti-aging research. I've taken note of his work, and as someone extremely interested in maximizing my longevity and vitality, I have incorporated a couple of his daily supplements into my own routine that I wasn't already using. These are the supplements and drugs he uses to preserve his youth.    Table of Contents ToggleResveratrolNicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)Vitamin D-3Check Your Vitamin D LevelsVitamin K2StatinMetforminMy Conclusion On The Supplements And Drugs David Sinclair UsesRelated Resveratrol  David Sinclair's takes 500 mg of Resveratrol with yogurt upon waking up. Resveratrol is a natural phenol produced by plants when they are under attack by pathogens, or in response to injury. It is essentially produced as a defense mechanism, and interestingly enough, when humans ingest it, it is purported to produce a similar hormetic that activates certain longevity pathways. The company I currently use third party tests every one one of their products, including their Resveratrol and NMN prior to selling to ensure consistent batch purity. I have yet to see any other company selling these two products publicly post their third party test results for every single batch they put up for sale.    Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)   In addition to Resveratrol, David Sinclair takes one gram (1,000 mg) of Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) at the same time each morning with his homemade yogurt. David takes raw NMN powder, but NMN is also available in tablet form. A common misconception is that NMN is the same as NR (Nicotinamide Riboside), and they are often confused with one another. The main difference between the two is the molecule size, which will likely impact how it is absorbed and assimilated. People often get confused between the two and they'll buy NR supplements, and think that they're getting NMN, but that's often not the case. I'm not going to say one is superior to the other because NMN has less data on it than NR. NR is the one that has human trials to show that it boosts NAD+ a significant amount. There's going to be more data coming on NMN in the near future, but for now, NR seems to be a more predictable bet in terms of choosing between the two. Obviously, David Sinclair has a lot of confidence in NMN as he's using the research chemical on himself, which I'm not against personally. It all comes down to risk tolerance when using anything without sufficient human data. The mechanism of action of both NR and NMN essentially boil down to the fact that they can significantly boost NAD+ levels in the body, which is something that the body produces significantly smaller amounts of as you age. By supplementing with an exogenous NAD+ precursor and boosting levels up to that of a young health adult, it is theorized that one can maintain healthier cell function in the body in old age and lower the incidence of disease, degradation, and a decline in quality of life. Personally, I use Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) because it is more cost effective right now, and it has human data to back up its efficacy and safety profile. I take 2 servings of ResveraCel per day as of now.    ResveraCel is a NR supplement that also contains Resveratrol and Trimethylglycine (TMG). Something less commonly spoken about is that TMG may be essential to use as a methyl donor alongside NR or NMN, depending on your genetic predisposition, in order to prevent deleterious effects from occurring. Vitamin D-3  In addition, David Sinclair takes Vitamin D-3 with vitamin K2. First of all, I can tell you right now that contrary to popular belief, you're not going to get enough Vitamin D from the sun outside, regardless of how long you're out there. It's very likely that you're going to need to supplement with it. I strongly advise you get a blood test to see where your vitamin D levels are at (I recommend getting a comprehensive health panel while you're at it). Check Your Vitamin D Levels HOW IT WORKS 1. Click “blood test” link above and it will redirect you to Private MD Labs Website 2. Select Male Athletic Anti-Aging Panel and add to cart 3. Add a Vit D, 25 Hydroxy test to it 4. Use “DC15” as a discount code for 15% off They will email you a form that you will print out and take to the nearest Labcorp for the blood draw (the site will guide you to the nearest lab). Then they email you the results within about 3 business days. Vitamin D is crucial and a super cheap supplement too. Get your blood test, see where you're at, and then create a protocol based on how much you need. Personally, I take 8,000 IUs of Vitamin D-3 per day. 8000 IUs would be considered a mega-dose by many, but this is what it puts my blood work at:  Vitamin K2  As far as a Vitamin K2, that's something that you can get from egg yolks, butter, dark chicken meat, cheese, Natto, and a variety of other foods. However, I do not believe that most people are hitting their requirements for Vitamin K2, and certainly not the vitamin K2 homologue MK-7. MK-7 is thought by many to be the most beneficial Vitamin K2 homologue. There is an abundance of information all over the web that can be overwhelming to take in. My advice would simply be to hit the daily requirements for all of the Vitamin K homologues. Vitamin K2 is the only vitamin that's proven to support arteriosclerosis reversal, the attenuation of further arterial calcification, and scavenging plaque in the arteries. A high menaquinone intake reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease. Vitamin K Dependent Proteins and the Role of Vitamin K2 in the Modulation of Vascular Calcification: A Review Vitamin K-Antagonists Accelerate Atherosclerotic Calcification and Induce a Vulnerable Plaque Phenotype Dietary Intake of Menaquinone Is Associated with a Reduced Risk of Coronary Heart Disease: The Rotterdam Study Vitamin K Status and Vascular Calcification: Evidence from Observational and Clinical Studies Effect of vitamin K2 on progression of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in nondialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5. Vitamin K2 is responsible for getting calcium into where it's supposed to go in the body and preventing calcification in the arteries, If you're deficient in vitamin K2, you're not going to have sufficient assimilation of that calcium into where you want it to be, and you may experience arterial calcification if your diet model supports it (most diets aren't optimized to avoid this). I would advise a 1 soft gel of the Jarrow Formulas Vitamin K-Complex per day. If you've seen my other articles on health supplements, you'll know that I've used this product for a while now. It's one of the main supplements that you should religiously take, especially if you're a bodybuilder. K2 is a more obscure vitamin that not a lot of people look at seriously, but it's one of the most important ones in my opinion. Statin  David Sinclair also takes a Statin, which is not a supplement, it's a prescription drug for modulating lipids/cholesterol levels. I don't advise that you haphazardly take a Statin just because David uses 0ne. There are natural ways to improve your lipid profile, and you may not even have a poor one to begin with. Again, this is only something that would be recommended by your doctor based on your current blood work should you have a genetic predisposition to poor lipids that cannot be corrected via diet, supplementation and lifestyle changes. Metformin  David Sinclair also takes 1 gram (1,000 mg) of Metformin per day. He started with 500 mg per day, and then he bumped it up to one gram. One of the main side effects of Metformin is impaired digestion, so I'm assuming that's why he started lower and titrated up to 1 gram. Metformin is a drug that is typically given to type II diabetics to increase insulin sensitivity and control their blood sugar. Chronically elevated blood sugar and insulin levels are thought to be one of the main causes of cancer, microbiome disturbances, and cardiovascular disease. This all stems back to diets including crappy food and sugar, and things that spike inflammation in the body, thus causing:  Poor digestion Suboptimal assimilation of nutrients Potentially increased levels of cancer cell growth or cancer cell proliferation Increased risk of cardiovascular disease Increased risk of plaque buildup in the arteries.  If you get your insulin sensitivity up, it will not only help lower the incidence of the aforementioned issues, it promotes a healthier body composition as well. There are a myriad of benefits that come from being insulin sensitive. This includes muscle growth potential. If you're weight training and eating in a calorie surplus, you will gain a far more favorable ratio of muscle to fat if you are insulin sensitive as opposed to if you had insulin resistance. Insulin acts as a nutrient transporter in the body, and if you have severe insulin resistance, you will assimilate nutrients very poorly and experience countless negative consequences, not only on your health, but your body composition and results in your athletic endeavors. Getting as insulin sensitive as possible is not just conducive to health and longevity, it's also something that's going to improve how you physically look, as well as how lean or how muscular you can get. My Conclusion On The Supplements And Drugs David Sinclair Uses I thought David Sinclair would have some massive supplement stack. I use more supplements than him, which surprised me. It just goes to show what areas he feels hold the significant majority of importance. Obviously, he has a lot of confidence in this NAD+ theory and Hormesis. Insulin sensitivity is also greatly taken into account because he's not diabetic, but he's taking Metformin anyways. Of the supplements and drugs mentioned, I take Resveratrol, a NAD+ precursor (NR as opposed to NMN), Vitamin K2 and Vitamin D. Although NMN looks very interesting, I'm waiting for more clinical data to emerge on that before I incorporate it into my protocol. Metformin is also something I've looked at personally. I haven't incorporated it yet, but it is something I'm seriously looking at myself. My fasting glucose levels are always spot on and I have great insulin sensitivity as is, so I have to weigh out the risk:reward of me using it.

    "content": "Old Man Reverses Hair Loss Via A Scalp Burn In A Coal Fire!?     This story is something I stumbled across by accident. It's really interesting as it backs up the theory of wounding, and also implies the importance of Prostaglandins and the recruitment of growth factors via a stimulus. In this story, a 78-year-old man with common male pattern baldness was dozing off in his armchair when he fell head first into a coal fire. He sustained full thickness burns to the left parietotemporal region, the bridge of the nose, and the left infraorbital area. He refused hospital admission and early surgery and was consequently managed as an outpatient. Two weeks later, he commented that his bald patch had started growing hair again. Over the next four months, this hair continued to grow. The article notes that although this case is interesting, it is difficult to see how this type of stimulation could be applied therapeutically.  Before And After Pictures Of The Old Man After The Scalp Burn Two Weeks After The Accident This looks pretty nasty. His scalp is burned to hell. Of interest, new hair growth has started in a previously severely miniaturized area of his scalp.  Six Weeks After The Accident Six weeks after the accident; hair is now thicker.  Four Months After The Accident Four months after the accident; thick hair growth is now visible.  This man had severe miniaturization with a large nearly completely bald spot, and regrew his hair there accidentally via burning the sh*t out of it. I'm not condoning going out and burning your head obviously, but its very insightful to how the body responds to skin damage, and the recruitment of localized healing and growth factors. There are actually guys out there who intentionally sunburn their scalps to elicit a similar response and drive growth factors to their balding zones. There is evidence to support that it works too in the clinical data: UVB light upregulates prostaglandin synthases and prostaglandin receptors in mouse keratinocytes – https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633299/ Wound Healing and Skin Regeneration – https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4292081/ Damaging the scalp seems to recruit a significant amount of growth factors that would otherwise not be present, which can lead to some degree of hair regrowth. A more practical application of this practice is seen through wounding (microneedling). Dermaroller And Microneedling Dermarolling is the most common form of microneedling, which involves using a mini-wheel covered with hundreds of tiny needles to gently prick the skin or scalp. Most would wonder logically wonder how stabbing your head several thousand hundred times could help.  The reality is that microneedling recruits these same growth factors and can promote healthy hair growth in areas that would otherwise be worse off. Maybe not to the extent that literally burning your head would have, but the calculated channels created in the scalp via microneedling have been clinically proven to aid in hair loss prevention.  If you're going to microneedle, I strongly advise you use a dermapen instead of a dermaroller, as a good dermapen will create straight channels into the scalp, whereas rollers create micro tears in the scalp.   It's fascinating to see accidental interventions like the story I mentioned resulting in dramatic outcomes via recruiting these growth factors in completely miniaturized areas. Does this mean you should go burn your head? No, of course not. There are things you can explore though that recruit these same growth factors, like a high quality Dermapen. Even just looking at this guy's story, regardless of how extreme it is, provides some valuable information that can be extrapolated to shed light on certain growth pathways that are otherwise overlooked.

    "content": "The TOP 3 Places To Meet Women | Even If You Have No Friends     This is also applicable if you moved to a new area and literally don't know anybody, which can feel very overwhelming. A quick disclaimer before we being, it should also go without saying that online dating is a no-brainer to supplement your cold approaching with, but this article is going to address cold approaching specifically. Most men wouldn't even know where to start in terms of building a social circle or how to meet women, especially if they're used to getting them handed to them on a silver platter in the past through their social circles and parties. Let's just say you're in either situation, where you don't really know anybody, you're in a new area, you're introverted, and you don't have any friends to begin with. In my experience, these are the top three places to meet women.  1. University And College Campuses Obviously, this is going to depend largely on if you have a reason to be there or not. Some people are comfortable going on campus even if they aren't a student, which is good because there is no reason why you shouldn't be. You should be comfortable going wherever you want by yourself. A university or college campus is a great place to meet people, especially if you're young. If you're in your early 20's, or your late teens, you already know that all the girls are in your age range on campus without having to second guess it. You also know that the likelihood of them being there without a clique around them is very high, as opposed to high school where girls are lumped up into friend groups at all times. In universities and colleges, the campuses are littered with attractive women at every turn, and they are very often in very favorable settings that won't require you to win over a group of 5 chicks just to hit on the 1 girl you're going for. I have yet to find another location that has even a fraction of the abundance of attractive women per square meter that are just chilling on their own. Sitting between classes studying, walking to the bus loop, walking to class, walking to the gym, sitting on their phones waiting for their next class to start, the scenarios are endless in which you will find girls in minimally intimidating/very approachable settings, which is great for guys who are just starting out. On campus you can literally get a weeks worth of dates set up within 1 hour of approaching. There is nothing more efficient. Most guys think it's the parties where you get the girls in college, but I think it is on campus during the day time where you can efficiently crank out highest volume work. If you're a social guy who's able to approach women at will without having severe crippling social anxiety, that's the first place to meet women in my opinion.  2. A Bar Close To Your Place Typically, it's a lot more cost effective to live near a popular bar than it is to live near a popular club, at least where I live. I advise finding the closest bar to your place with a thriving night scene and making that your go to spot (don't pick a sh*t hole dive bar just because it's close to your place though). There is usually at least a couple good bars in each city. If you happen to live within walking distance, then that's even better. The shorter the commute from the bar to your place the better for avoiding last minute resistance and other unforeseen complications. It can not only be your night-life spot on, but your date spot during the day as well. A bar close to your place is by far the easiest place to set up a consistent blueprint for going on first dates with girls you've cold approached during the day/met via online dating (during the bars dead hours), as well as meeting new people in the night scene during the bars busy nights. At the bar you can actually get a good conversation going, whereas at a club you're basically yelling in each other's ears pretending you know what each other are saying when you don't.  My strategy each week was more or less to crank out cold approaches on campus and wherever my daily errands took me and set up dates with those girls the same day I met them, as well as do a blitz on Sunday nights on all the online dating platforms and set up as many dates for the coming week as possible (the best time to blitz is Sunday night still in my opinion). If by Friday and Saturday I didn't have dates set up that night or I didn't have a follow up with a girl I was already seeing, I would go to the bar. Become Comfortable Going To Bars Even By Yourself If you have no friends, that's fine. Unless you're literally standing on a wall by yourself and looking awkward, no one's going to know or care if you're there by yourself because you're going to be walking around and socializing. You can easily make friends at bars and build a social circle throughout the night as you communicate with women and talk to other men. When guys see you having success with women, by nature they want to become your friend and hang out with you. Women by nature will also be more attracted to you and willing to talk to you if you have social proof via other attractive women. It's extremely easy to build this kind of social proof too, even if you don't know anybody. When you see a guy talking to a girl, unless he looks like a complete creep or there's something totally off about his demeanour or the girl he's talking to, most will assume that he's with her without even questioning it. Use this to your advantage in the night scene. You can either look like the creepiest dude in the room by hitting on every girl, or you can spin it and make it look like you're the most popular guy in the room just as easily. Recruit A Wing Woman Something I came up with on the fly when I first started heavily getting into night game was recruiting a wing woman. This idea dawned on me one night at a bar 7 years ago while I was hitting on a chick who seemed mildly interested in me, but repeatedly told me she had a boyfriend and would playfully stop me each time I tried to make a move (something I don't advise you try to capitalize on necessarily, but I could've cared less at the time). Even if this girl flat out rejected me I still would've done the same thing I'm about to explain by the way, as long as the girl doesn't obviously think you're a creepy piece of sh*t this should work (which should almost never happen if you look good and have even have decent conversation skills). If you can tell you aren't getting anywhere, or you get lightly rejected, tell the girl that she's going to be your wing woman for the night. More often than not, they'll jump at the idea and act like your best friend for the night and literally get girls for you. Every single person for the most part has some level of social anxiety, which is the reason why most men and women are just standing and talking to their friends being wallflowers at the bar. Very often, they'll gladly act like your best friend for the night and literally hand girls to you on a silver platter just because they think it's fun, and it's something for them to do rather than sit around and chug beer at a table with their friends. If you're laughing with an attractive woman, naturally, every one in the room will start to perceive you as someone with higher value. As she introduces you to other attractive girls (who she probably doesn't even know either) and plays wing-woman for you throughout the night, you can artificially inflate your social proof to stupid high levels and make every one think you're some big shot, even if you literally showed up an hour ago with no friends. Think about it logically, if you saw a guy laughing and visibly having a great time with an attractive chick, and then 10 minutes later you see him laughing and having a great time with another attractive chick, and he's just all over the map and seemingly knows every one, you won't know any better, and neither will anyone else. The girls you meet will logically assume that you're close friends with the girl wing-manning you, or else she wouldn't have been “at the bar with you” in the first place. The idea is gold and if executed correctly can literally transform the dynamic of any night game setting for you. If you get a girl into a mindset of trying this fun, unique thing that she's probably never done before, I guarantee you she will more often than not be up for it. If you're a chill guy with above average looks (not hard to do), and a girl rejects you, she's not going to think you're a creep unless you come across as a creep. 3. Wherever You Go During The Day This is probably the best tip, because what a lot of guys make a mistake doing is they go out in dedicated blocks of their free time to cold approach. The way you should be doing cold approach in a time efficient way is incorporating it into your every day schedule. If you're going to the grocery store, going to the mall, running errands, going to the post office, etc., the likelihood of you crossing paths with attractive women is pretty high. You're going to have to leave your house at some point to go run errands. When you run errands, you're going to come across attractive women. This is where you will knock out your cold approaches. It's very unlikely that you're going to go find more sexually available women if you set aside a block of an hour to go cold approach at a mall as opposed to just incorporating cold approach into the errands you do already. I'm sure you've gone to grocery stores to shop and been pissed at yourself because you didn't approach that cute girl you saw, or you're at the gym and you didn't strike up a conversation with that chick you see however often, or you were at the mall shopping and bit*hed out from hitting on the really attractive girl you noticed working there and you went home kicking yourself. I guarantee you've had a situation like this before that's pissed you off that you know that you should have capitalized on. This is why you NEED to incorporate cold approach into your daily life. If you're a student on campus this is especially applicable to you, as you literally are walking around in the quintessential hub of vagina on a daily basis and don't do sh*t about it. Stop thinking about how you will get hammered out of your mind at that party coming up next weekend and then somehow get laid and take advantage of what is literally abundantly present right in front of your eyes man. On any campus just during the time span of walking from one class to another class you could very likely knock out 3 quality approaches. Social Anxiety And Approach Anxiety You need to have your social anxiety and approach anxiety handled. Especially if you aren't going to be in densely filled areas like college campuses. If you're walking around in the daytime running errands and you see somebody random, you need to capitalize. You can't overthink it for 5 minutes and then eat your heart out after you see her walk out the door. Eventually, once you get very good at this (you can approach 9 out of 10 women at the drop of a hat), you can incorporate it into your daily life and will never have to set aside time to go approaching again, and it'll just be a part of your everyday routine. Incorporate Cold Approach With Your Daily Life All of the three mentioned places are very effective to meet women, and I strongly advise you to incorporate them into your daily life. That's the key, incorporating them into your daily life rather than setting aside blocks of time. If you need to go knock out approach anxiety and blow it out, then go out with buddies and set aside time to do that. But once you get that handled, you shouldn't have to go set aside massive blocks of time anymore as it should be seamlessly incorporated into your every day routine on the fly. Once you can actually approach women, this should become integrated into your life, rather than something that seems like a chore that you have to go out of your way to do. Why Clubs Are Overrated Clubs are extremely overrated. One reason is that the likelihood of a club being within walking distance of your place is typically very low. Another reason being that the absurdly high volume music is a huge inhibiting factor to having a fluid conversation. In general, when girls go out to clubs they're traveling from further away and are in bigger groups, hence they are less likely to break off from the group. Unless you have a spot literally in the heart of downtown, or if the clubs are in your area where you can easily invite people back for a drink and break them off from the group, you won't have much success at clubs other than random makeouts and number collecting, which is a waste of time.  Clubs are subpar in terms of efficiency. Even making friends in general at clubs is hard because you can't use your social skills as much. It comes down to physical game more so than verbal at the club. Even if you've developed your social freedom over the years and have great conversation skills, it is difficult to take advantage of it when you literally have to scream in the ear of the person you're talking to.

Via uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, DNP raises body temperature in a dose dependent manner. DNP use is the most frowned upon practice in the bodybuilding world aside from Synthol in my opinion.  Logically, it makes sense why, as it has a very low margin of error, and if you accidentally overdose on it, there really isn't a lot that can help besides attempting to stay hydrated and manually lowering body temperature. If too much DNP is accidentally ingested, you are pretty much f*cked. With that being said, let's talk about my experience with it.  My Experience With DNP I’ve used DNP a handful of times now, and I (like many others) had a lot of preconceived notions about the compound based on what others have said about it online. Upon a first glance, it sounds incredible and like it is the most unbeatable fat burning compound in existence and you can supposedly eat like crap on it and still get ripped. First off, this couldn’t be further from the truth, and if you do happen to get ripped from it eating like crap, it’s because your calorie intake remained reasonable still during that time frame. When I overate on DNP to test this, I still gained fat. I have tried using a low dose of DNP for a long duration of time (200mg for 4-6+ weeks). I have tried medium dosing DNP for a moderate duration of time (500mg for around 2-4 weeks). I have tried high dosing DNP for a very short duration of time (750-1000mg for a few days). I have tried essentially all of the most popular protocols with DNP. Cutting From Double Digit Body Fat % To Single Digit Body Fat % The most notable thing I have found with DNP is that I could only reap the fat burning benefits of it when I was in the double digit body fat % range. It is notorious for stimulating appetite and I get it VERY BADLY. When I take more than 200 mg per day I am ravenous all day long. Not only does stimulating my appetite make dieting torturous, but once I get to single digit levels of body fat %, my calories are so low that having a heightened appetite makes getting leaner for me virtually impossible. Not only that, but I have noticed that even when I stick to my guns and endure the torture of being starving all day while on DNP in the single digit levels of body fat %, I don’t lose fat that easily, or much at all. This is where I came to the conclusion that for me personally, the only time DNP use would make sense would be when I'm in the double digit range of body fat % and am trying to cut down to the single digits. At this point, I would still be eating enough calories and not doing such an insane amount of cardio that a heightened appetite would not be a huge detriment to my progress because it won’t be that difficult to stick to my caloric allotment, and fat will melt off when I'm over 10% body fat while on DNP. For example, getting from 20% to 10% body fat on DNP for me is exponentially easier than it is for me to get from 10% to 6% body fat on DNP. I find once I hit 10% there is a big sticking point, and other fat burning compounds start to be more useful at this stage than DNP. Improving Insulin Sensitivity One of DNP’s greatest attributes is its ability to increase insulin sensitivity. I have verified this through fasted blood glucose monitoring. When someone becomes insulin resistant, their body doesn’t partition nutrients as effectively, and they start storing fat much easier, and it also becomes MUCH harder to put on muscle mass. DNP is effective at resetting insulin sensitivity, even after long durations of continuous GH use, or a long-term high intake of carbohydrates. With that being said, insulin resistance can be reversed with far safer alternatives. Bridging During A Bulk Aside from getting down to 10% body fat at a very quick rate, the only situation I found use for DNP in was as a bridge during a bulk to get my body fat % back down to a reasonable level quickly. As you bulk, your calories are constantly going up, and you are becoming more and more desensitized to insulin as your carbohydrate intake goes up, along with your body fat. Eventually, you will get to a point where your insulin sensitivity or body fat level is preventing you from putting on a favorable amount of muscle:fat anymore. By the time you’ve been bulking on high carbs and calories for several months, you might only be putting on 0.1-0.2 pounds of muscle for every 1 pound of fat you put on (this isn’t uncommon). I’ve been there. This is where I've deployed DNP on a handful of occasions to quickly strip fat off and restore insulin sensitivity. Typically, once an individual reaches this sticking point in a bulk where no matter what they do, they either can’t gain weight, or if they increase their calories more they just gain substantially more fat than muscle, they will take this as a sign to start a full blown cut phase. I have used DNP as a bridging agent at this stage in the past with success to offset the need for a full cut altogether. After eating in a surplus for a while, your metabolism will have sped up to a point where if you dropped into a deficit suddenly, fat would literally drip off you. Whenever my body was in a scenario like this, adding DNP to the equation just made things progress at a much faster rate and allowed me to drop a massive amount of fat within a few weeks in a calorie deficit, restore insulin sensitivity, and get my body fat back down to a reasonable enough level where I could then jump back into a surplus. Jumping back into a surplus and getting off the DNP always seemed to result in a favorable anabolic rebound effect where I could then continue to gain muscle with a more favorable ratio of muscle:fat once again. In theory, by cycling this method each time body fat levels get to an unreasonable level, one could essentially be on a “perma-bulk” where they are constantly gaining muscle at a favorable ratio relative to their gains in body fat. This is not a strategy I currently utilize, although I can't deny its efficacy when I think back to when I did use DNP in this fashion (which was years ago). The reason why I don't use DNP anymore is mostly because it makes me feel horrible, it's not a compound you want to live on, or ideally take at all if you don't need to, and my body fat never gets out of control anymore. The Best Diet To Use On DNP Is A Ketogenic Diet While some individuals feel that they absolutely need some carbs in their diet while on DNP to function, I actually found that using a Ketogenic, or very low carb style diet is the most comfortable way to diet on DNP (I've tried high-carb, moderate-carb, low-carb, and Keto). Not only were insulin spikes essentially non-existent because I was in Ketosis (which helped keep my appetite in check tremendously), but whenever you ingest carbohydrates on DNP it creates a very unpleasant scenario (especially in the summer time) where your body heat is essentially dictated by how many carbohydrates you're ingesting. The body turns into a furnace of carbohydrates, and the higher one's carb intake is, the higher their body temperature will go. The higher your body temperature gets, the more you will sweat like a pig and feel like crap, and the more dangerous it becomes as well as it can send you into an overheating spiral, or cause severe/fatal dehydration and electrolyte depletion. The fat burning capabilities of DNP on a Ketogenic diet with no carbs vs. a carb dense diet are exactly the same. By taking in carbs all that's occurring is unnecessarily cranking body heat through the roof, causing a crazy amount of sweating, and possibly even putting oneself in a dangerous situation via electrolyte depletion and dehydration. How I Protected Myself When Running DNP + My DNP Protocol (This is just what I did, and should by no means be interpreted as something that should be followed or replicated.) This is exactly what I used with DNP to protect myself as much as possible from potential side effects:  250 mg DNP every day for 14-21 days 2 cups of V8 vegetable juice per day + 1 banana per day (this is ~2000mg potassium)/Pedialyte is very good too and I sometimes drank that instead 2 grams Vitamin C divided into 2 doses 1200 IU Vitamin E divided into 3 doses 600 mg Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) divided into 3 doses 10 mg Claritin in the morning (Antihistamine to mitigate any potential allergic reactions/rash breakouts) Multivitamin in the morning Gorilla Mind Rush pre-work out (for energy because I drag ass on DNP) Lots of water every day 45 minutes – 1 hour cardio post-workout. Sometimes I'll take some more Gorilla Mind Rush or 16mg of Ephedrine in the middle of the day if I feel run down or get bad carb cravings. Drink plenty of water during cardio sessions and have a solid meal with a cup of V8 post-workout to replenish my body  Why I Used DNP In The Past I used DNP in the past because I was young, somewhat reckless, experimental, and really was curious to see what it was all about. I've tried it several times and to be completely honest I wouldn't use it again unless more clinical data came out revealing anti-cancer properties or other longevity benefits. Let me elaborate on that a bit. When bodybuilders use DNP, they usually use it to get shredded, which is what I also used it for when I was experimenting with it years ago. It made me very lethargic, run down, and it would feel nearly impossible to muster the energy to go to the gym without slamming a ton of stimulants. I was flat all the time, it was extremely difficult to get a good workout in. In terms of fat loss benefits for somebody who is trying to keep their appetite at bay and relies on getting quality workouts in, I don't think it's a good choice when there are efficacious alternatives that will still burn more than enough fat without crippling your workouts. It makes suffering 10 times worse when you're dieting and your calorie intake starts getting low. Other Uses For DNP And The Future of DNP DNP is a chemical uncoupling agent, which is interesting. As far as a fat burner, it works, there's no denying that. But I think it is more effective for those who actually have a lot of fat to lose. If somebody was going to die of obesity because they literally couldn't exercise and were absurdly overweight, then I believe DNP could then have some sort of potential therapeutic application. For bodybuilding purposes though, my stance is different. When you get to the unsustainable single-digit body fat percentage range, you're so hungry all day that anything you add that increases your appetite will just make getting leaner exponentially harder. DNP makes it way harder to stick to your diet and get your workouts in. Some of the anti-cancer and longevity properties that chemical uncoupling agents exhibit are something I've had my eye on. I believe we're going to see more data in the future that actually explores DNP use as a potential therapeutic treatment of sorts for different unrelated conditions that you would otherwise probably not think of. DNP Review Conclusion As a fat burning agent, I wouldn't advise using DNP. Frankly, the likelihood that you are in a situation where there isn't a more efficacious alternative that won't wreck your workouts and make sticking to your diet far more difficult is low. I still await further data before I make any conclusive statements on DNP's other potential therapeutic applications. I do believe the future is going to uncover some interesting things about DNP though, and perhaps other analogs with similar attributes. Chemical uncoupling agents will likely greatly impact the medical community in some context, and their use will probably become more mainstream in the decades to come despite currently being frowned upon by the masses. It's going to be interesting to see how it unfolds, as there is absolutely some therapeutic promise that can be extrapolated from the available data we currently have on DNP.

    "content": "My First Steroid Cycle | What I Would Change If I Could Go Back In Time     My First Steroid Cycle Most of you guys know I use a high-normal dose of TRT. I try to keep myself right on the cusp of supraphysiological Testosterone levels. In the past I've blasted with supraphysiological amounts numerous times, and the first steroid cycle in particular is what I want to delve into today. My first steroid cycle was the classic 500 mg of Test Enanthate for 12 weeks. This is exactly how it was laid out:     Weeks Testosterone Enanthate PCT (Post-Cycle Therapy)     1-12 500 mg per week split into 1x 250 mg shot Monday and 1x 250 mg shot Thursday    12-14 (Waited for ester to clear before starting PCT) (Waited for ester to clear before starting PCT)   14-16  Nolvadex (40 mg per day) and Clomid (100 mg per day)   16-18  Nolvadex (20 mg per day) and Clomid (50 mg per day)     That's the standard “go-to newbie cycle” that is talked about on the forums all the time, and is about as simple as it gets. I didn't even use an aromatase inhibitor because I was so uneducated and haphazardly jumped into the cycle thinking I knew everything already. Looking back in hindsight, that cycle was overkill. I didn't need nearly that much gear for where I was at. Even now, most of you guys know my TRT protocol is only 100 mg of Testosterone Propionate per week right now (at least at the time of writing this article). It changes sometimes based on different experiments I'm doing, but that's roughly where it's at all the time. My Testosterone replacement protocol has evolved over the years as I started to realize that I could get away with less and less. It used to be 200 mg of Enanthate per week, then I dropped it down to 150 mg of Enanthate per week, and then I dropped it to 125 mg of Enanthate per week. Then, I changed the ester to Testosterone Propionate, lowered the weekly dosage to 100 mg, and starting pinning micro shots every day with an insulin pin to try and replicate what would be closer to normal endogenous Testosterone production (this results in higher Free T and lower levels of aromatization). Knowing what I know now, and seeing first hand how much size I can hold with only 100 mg of Testosterone Propionate per week, I brutally regret using 500 mg of Testosterone per week for my first cycle.  What I Would Change In My First Steroid Cycle If I Could Go Back In Time If could go back in time, I could have gotten away with half of that easily, and still made significant amounts of progress. I also should have waited until I had a more thorough understanding of diet. I knew how to lift heavy and train hard, but my knowledge about dieting and learning how to prime my metabolism was not where it needed to be. As a result, I spent a fair bit of time on hormones wasting muscle building potential, and getting fat when I didn't need to. For the majority of men, you only have so many cycles in the tank before you get to a point where you either: A) Have accelerated the miniaturization of your hair follicles and are forced to stop using hormones to prevent further hair loss B) Have a health issue that forces you off hormones This is why it is so incredibly crucial to fully understand how to diet, train, and how to milk the most muscle out of intelligent dosages as possible. Even if you're side effect free, the higher your dosage is, the less potential muscle growth you will get out of each dosage increment as Myostatin will increase regardless to inhibit you from gaining too much muscle in the presence of supraphysiological androgens. If you start at 500 mg and plateau, where do you go from there? You either increase the dosage, introduce other androgens on top of what you're already using, or you have to come off/greatly lower the dosage periodically to reset Myostatin. Using too much gear off the bat is a big regret I have, but there wasn't as much of information available back then as there is now. There were forums, but it wasn't like it is now. When I was a teenager, bodybuilding was cool and getting as big as possible was the objective. As the years progressed and social media exploded, freak show bodybuilders started to look less and less appealing, and we all started noticing how many bodybuilders were actually dropping like flies from health problems. To the average juice head, 500 mg per week is nothing. This is partially because we have all been brainwashed into thinking that there is no ceiling on the returns from AAS, when in reality, once you hit a gram or two per week, the diminishing returns are so drastic that even if you tripled the dosage at that point, you would just end up with more side effects and no additional muscle gain. If you're convinced every IFBB pro is using 5 grams per week, then 500 mg per week seems a lot more reasonable. The reality is that 500 mg is actually a lot of gear. I can sustain my current physique on 100 mg of Testosterone per week. Maybe even less, and I will likely see how low I can get it before I start seeing muscle loss in the near future (androgens are one of the main roots of heart disease). If I could go back in time, I would probably use around 250 mg of Testosterone propionate, or 300 mg Testosterone Enanthate per week for my first steroid cycle (depending on my blood work). How Many Milligrams Of Testosterone Do Men Naturally Produce? The average natural male produces 3 mg to 10 mg of Testosterone per day, with the average being 6-7 mg per day. That is only 70 mg per week on the absolute high end of the genetic elite. Keep in mind, there is no ester that needs to be cleaved from the molecule, so 21 – 70 mg is literally 21 – 70 mg when it comes to endogenous production. When you factor in ester weight with Testosterone Enanthate, 500 mg per week might actually only end up being between 300 – 350 mg of usable Testosterone. However, that 350 mg is still several times higher than the endogenous production of a genetic elite. It is around 7 times more Testosterone than an average young healthy male produces per week (50 mg). Personally, I don't see any justification to start at 500 mg for a first cycle, or a dosage that would then put someone in a position where there is so much aromatization occurring that they are forced to deploy an Aromatase Inhibitor. If you are already on half a gram of gear and throwing back Aromasin/Arimidex tabs just to keep your Estrogen in check during your first cycle, you're way off the mark from smart bodybuilding practices. Do you really need to increase your androgen index by 7-10x times higher than what it normally is just to push past your genetic plateau? No. A much more reasonable dosage will still provide significant growth opportunity with a much lower incidence of side effects, while ensuring greater long-term growth potential, and I wish I realized this sooner.

    "content": "How To Get Blood Work In Canada | High Quality Testing Over The Border     How To Get Blood Work In Canada I always get asked how to get blood work in Canada. In Canada it's not so simple, as you have to go to your doctor and they have to prescribe you the tests you want. Even if you tell your doctor you want to pay for them out of pocket, often times they will refuse if they don't think the test is something you need. In short, it's very difficult to get what you need in Canada. Even if you do happen to get the tests you need, oftentimes, they need to outsource it to the United States because don't have the resources to do it in Canada. Most of the tests in Canada are years behind the US as well. For example, in the US, lipid panels will often show you VLDL and LDL as a default, whereas in Canada if you ask for your VLDL they will probably refuse, or may not even know what you are talking about. The hormone profiles are often inaccurate in Canada as well, as they utilize assays that are not optimized even optimized for men when they are literally testing men. For example, if you get an estradiol test, you're probably not going to get a sensitive assay one in Canada, and the result of that will be a false reading on your blood work which could lead to dangerous aromatase inhibitor usage.  High-Quality Testing Over The Border I get all of my blood work done via Private MD Labs.  Here's the catch, you can't purchase any test on their site with a Canadian credit card. If you've tried as a Canadian, you've probably been shut down before and noticed that. There are no LabCorp locations in Canada for you to go get your blood test done at either. Most Canadians don't even think of this, but what I do and what I would advise you do if you live close to the border is call Private MD Labs on the phone and tell them you want to process a Canadian credit card over the phone and place an order. While their website won't accept a Canadian credit card, on the phone they'll manually process your credit card and let you order whatever you want. What you can do from there is schedule your blood draw at whatever the closest LabCorp is to you over the border. After you pay and schedule an appointment at LabCorp, you can drive over the border to that LabCorp, get your blood drawn, and get your test results in a few days. That's what I do every time. Paying Out Of Pocket Yes you will have to pay out of pocket and you will probably not get reimbursed via your private health insurance (if you have it). I have insurance and I still opt to pay out of pocket simply because of the massive hassle trying to get a doctor here to prescribe you the tests you want is, and the lack of accurate testing. Honestly I get angry just thinking about all the times I've been in a doctors office in Canada and asked for a thyroid panel, or a lipid profile, or any other basic health marker and been given a hard time, talked down to, and just been given blatantly incorrect information. The fact that it happens the majority of the time is f*cking ridiculous and frankly I'm sick of it. That's just the price I pay for getting what I need when I need it, hassle-free, and getting the quality of tests that I need. More often than not, in Canada, even if a person gets their tests paid for, it's not a test that has accurate results that are indicative of what that particular hormone is actually at. If you want to make it easy on yourself, pay the extra money and go to the States for a quality test. I would advise you do this if you are close to the border and it's feasible for you and your budget. If you're on a budget, I would recommend at least going for your sensitive assay hormone panels and lipid profiles unless you happen to have access to those testing methodologies here in Canada where you live. Private MD Labs Discount Code I have a discount code set up for me that you can use to save 15% on your entire panel via Private MD Labs. I do not get a commission if you use this code, nor does it benefit me in any way, it simply gives you 15% off of your order when you mention it on the phone. The code is DC15. My Recommended Blood Work Panel The blood panel I generally recommend is the “Male Athletic Anti-Aging Panel.” It's the most comprehensive panel that I would advise for those who just want a thorough assessment of their health markers. There are a lot of reasons to go to the States for testing if you can, and I strongly advise you to take advantage of it if you're close to the border.

    "content": "What Causes “Alien Gains”? | Unsurprisingly, It’s Not Muscle Control     What Causes Alien Gains I've seen quite a few videos now on YouTube and Instagram with guys showing off their rippling, spasming muscles, and the slang term has dubbed them as “Alien Gains”.                View this post on Instagram                      How all this started -> that’s it bro. Thanks for ur great support everyone !! Without u guys all this should not be possible. . . [.] . #inspiration#physique#ripped#aesthetics#motivation#discipline#training#abs#fitness#keepgoing#sixpack#transformation#fitness#shredded A post shared by  Jo Lindner (@joesthetics) on May 12, 2019 at 8:10am PDT   \n\n Every one seems to think they have some sort of innate unique ability to manipulate the muscle fibers. The most notable for this is Uzoma Obilor.  He was on a show called “The Doctors,” and even the doctors couldn't tell him what was wrong.  To me, the doctors not knowing the root cause was baffling because this the cause is actually pretty simple and fairly commonly known among those who work out. Most guys who go to the gym have experienced this before to some extent. If you eat a crappy diet that gives you an electrolyte imbalance, you will probably get muscle cramps and muscle spasms after the gym at one point or another. That is literally what causes “Alien Gains”, an electrolyte imbalance.  Muscle Spasms Caused by Electrolyte Imbalance I'm sure you've gone to train your chest, done a lot of fly and pressing movements, and then noticed your chest seizing up or spasming before. When you're dehydrated or you don't have a proper electrolyte balance via dietary deficiencies, your body is not getting what it needs to properly contract and relax your muscles. If you have a deficiency, and then you go train hard, you deplete your electrolyte balance even further. As a result, you can get some crazy spasms. The reality is that Alien Gains are simply caused by a poor diet, or a CAV3 gene mutation. A mutation of this gene can result in a shortage of caveolin-3 protein in the muscle cell membrane. The reduction of this protein can impair the regulation of calcium levels in muscle cells (a crucial electrolyte), leading to abnormal muscle contractions in response to stimulation. This is the root of what is known as “Rippling Muscle Disease”. So no, these guys don't have some special mind to muscle connection where they can trigger muscle rippling at will. Rather, the lack of bodily control is what is causing the muscle ripples in the first place. If you get really dehydrated, eat a subpar diet, and go to the gym and train chest balls to the wall, afterwards when you go home you can contract your chest and then hyperextend it and watch it spasm. The net result is the same. Muscle spasms via an electrolyte imbalance. A gene mutation induced result will likely be more dramatic, due to an inherent inability to regulate electrolytes, which could likely then be compounded even further by poor diet practices. Muscle Spasms While Bulking This is something I've experienced in the past during “dirty bulks” where I ate excessive amounts of carbs and junk food, as well as used highly aromatizing AAS. My electrolyte balance was thrown way out of whack, and I would experience multiple episodes of muscle spasms mid-workout. That's what Alien gains are. It's not some special ability, it's just the bodies lack of muscle control induced by an electrolyte imbalance.

    "title": "How To Increase Low HDL Cholesterol Levels With Niacin, Krill Oil & Cardarine",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/how-to-increase-low-hdl-cholesterol-levels/",
    "date": "2019-06-17T18:00:06+00:00",
    "content": "How To Increase Low HDL Cholesterol Levels With Niacin, Krill Oil & Cardarine     Chronically Low HDL Cholesterol Levels From TRT It's very common for men on TRT to have really low HDL cholesterol levels. I have the same issue. Anyone on exogenous androgens, regardless if it's SARMs, steroids, or prohormones, will likely have a suboptimal lipid profile. Typically, the biggest thing that takes a hit is your HDL, and oftentimes it gets completely neglected. The mentality, for some reason, is “I'm going to leave it low because I can't get it up.”  Or, “It's fine, as long as my LDL is low enough, then I'm good.” It's not the case. You always need your HDL high, or above 40 mg/dL at an absolute bare minimum. There are a lot of guys walking around with single-digit HDL levels and not caring. A reading of less than 40 mg/dL is considered a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.  My Last Blood Test Result  As you can see above, my HDL Cholesterol was 31 mg/dL on my last blood test, which is below the reference range. It's the one health marker that I've always struggled to get on point. After doing a bit more research, I've created a protocol designed for boosting HDL specifically. It's an extreme protocol, and I don't advise doing it. I'll be logging exactly what I'm going to be doing though, and I'll keep you guys posted on how it goes for me. How To Increase Low HDL Cholesterol Levels You guys probably already know that I'm a proponent of EPA, DHA, high dose Omega-3s. Krill Oil – 3 grams per day I've talked about krill oil briefly before, but krill oil is far superior to fish oil for boosting HDL. If you look at the clinical data, you will see that it is far more efficacious at boosting your HDL.  This is why I'm going to be having 3 grams of krill oil per day, and reducing my fish oil intake a bit to offset that extra EPA and DHA I'll be getting from the krill oil. Niacin – 1.5 grams per day Niacin (Nicotinic Acid) Immediate Release. The immediate release version has better-supporting data than sustained release formulations.  You don't want Inositol, you want to get immediate release Nicotinic Acid. Be aware that this kind of dosing protocol is not sustainable. 1.5 grams of Nicotinic Acid is about 100 times higher than the RDA. That's not a sustainable practice that you can use long-term. The goal of this protocol is to boost my HDL high enough and then sustain it long-term with just the krill oil, but we'll see how that goes. Cardarine – 10 mg per day If you haven't already read my Cardarine article then I strongly advise you go check it out before reading on. It details every clinical trial conducted on humans, conducted on rats, goes over the cancer data, and covers everything you would want to know about Cardarine. I'm confident in saying that it's the most comprehensive article on the entire internet about Cardarine. You should note that Cardarine is not an approved supplement or compound for improving your HDL levels. Nevertheless, that's one of the things that it was designed to do, and it does a very good job at it, which is why I will be incorporating it. It was given to patients with chronically low HDL in human trials and the results were very impressive. While many use Cardarine for its purported performance enhancing attributes, I would reserve it solely for HDL optimization. I think it is an overrated fat burner, and I don't have a dire need for improving my endurance. Cardarine use is also not a sustainable practice. I plan on using it sporadically to boost my HDL up, and then coming off of it. The long-term effects it may have on the human body are unknown, and living on unapproved compounds is something I prefer to avoid when possible. Sustaining HDL Cholesterol Levels I want to see how high I can get my HDL levels first. Then, I want to see how high I can maintain it long-term with more sustainable practices. In the short-term, my protocol will be 3 grams of krill oil, 1.5 grams of Niacin, and 10 mg of Cardarine per day. I'm going to go get my blood drawn, and I'll keep you guys posted on the results. Having chronically low HDL will greatly contribute to cardiovascular disease in the future, and getting it addressed sooner rather than later is the best thing you can do for yourself. If you are on exogenous hormones, I strongly advise you get a lipid panel done and look into boosting your HDL as well.

Chris elaborates on how Derek is his resource for male hormone protocols, and Derek recalls back to when Chris was that resource for him. Chris started TRT when he was 24 years old. His concern was if he did want to have kids one day, could he still do that. Chris says he will be getting back on TRT, but for now he's just on HCG.  8:50 – 10:14 Will Chris Ever Post In Fields Again?  Chris says he's 36 years old, but if he were to do in fields again, it would be a different kind and it'd be more entertaining. Chris talks about even being in an open relationship while filming for GLL.  10:14 – 14:43 What’s Chris’ Current Hair Loss Prevention Regimen?  Since Chris isn't on steroids, he says he only uses Nizoral shampoo 2-3 times a week. Chris has a Capillus Laser Cap which he believes makes existing hair healthier and thicker Chris is no longer on Finasteride Chris talks about his hair transplants. Chris lists his recommended doctors for hair transplants:  Dr. Sanusi Umar (Redondo Beach, CA) Dr. Steven Gabel (Hillsboro, Portland, OR) Dr. Glenn Charles (Boca Raton, FL)   Chris got a BHT Body hair transplant. Getting 300-500 hairs from his chin and transplanted them to his head.  14:43 – 17:04 Chris Talks About What Happened To Scotty  Chris invited Scotty to his wedding but Scotty couldn't make it.

Chris dreams about being chased by a guy with a knife and seeing a bike and then getting stabbed in the back because he doesn't know how to ride it. Derek and Chris talk about not knowing how to change a tire and how people assume they're experts in all fields.  46:14 – 51:35 How To Monetize Content Online After Finishing The “Get Laid” Phase Of Your Life  Free content is like advertising, but they don't do paid advertising. If all of the Good Looking Loser articles were originally released in an eBook instead, nobody would be watching or listening in. If you have an audience, you can monetize it. Focus on content and posting. Once the following/audience comes, they will trust your judgment on recommending products for them to buy.  51:35 – 54:07 Did Chris Have Any Self Doubt About His Expertise When He First Started Good Looking Loser?  Chris talks about how he started his blog with Scotty, how bumpy it was, and how his original plan was to just give fitness advice as a personal trainer.  54:07 – 59:47 How To Set Realistic Income Expectations As An Aspiring Entrepreneur  Chris got the idea from smart passive income to give away content for free. Chris talks about affiliate programs. Chris started his income expectations on GLL at $50 a day, and $100 a day for Happy Hippo. Getting into Gorilla Mind, Chris' expectations were extremely high. If you make $500,000 a month, most people would tell you that's a success. It doesn't feel like it though if your goal is $1 million a month. So, you're always going to feel you're playing from behind if you don't set realistic goals, and that's not a healthy mentality. Always have low expectations going into business ventures.  59:52 – 1:04:08 After The Getting Laid And Getting Paid Aspect Of Your Life Is Over What’s Next?  Chris talks about his financial standing. Chris talks about his children's foundation. Derek talks about still focusing on content and his higher aspirations.

Derek delves into lay count goals and getting over insecurity Derek discusses transitioning into a stable relationship  1:07:21 – 1:09:50 Should You Go To College?  The usual alternatives of not going to college:  Go join the Army Get a minimum-wage job Work on the oil rigs   Chris is going to post an article about what do you do if you should opt to not go to college. Derek wishes he didn't go to college at all. Student debt is a financial scam and a waste of time. The situations where going to college makes sense  1:09:54 – 1:12:31 Derek & Chris On Unexpected Outcomes Stemming From Starting A Business  Unexpected outcomes ultimately contribute to who you are as a person and having no regrets.  1:12:31 – 1:16:51 How Your Happiness Level Is Dictated By Getting Rich  There's no amount you can get, or be given, or earned that's going to make you happy. Happiness is meeting the basic necessities, paying bills, and some play money.  1:18:11 – 1:22:32 The Importance Of Incorporating Fun Into Your Life  Plan to one fun or new experience a week. Go out with your girl. Learning how to have fun and be present is critical during self-improvement.  1:22:32 – 1:25:04 How Bodybuilding Discipline Can Be Applied To Getting Girls And Money  The commitment of a bodybuilder is something that can be redirected and applied to succeed in all facets of life.  1:25:04 – 1:28:38 Should You Focus On Your Strengths And Outsource Your Weaknesses In Business?  When you're starting out, you should try to get a fundamental understanding of everything. Chris talks about his weakness in accounting. Derek talks about teaching his employees. You need to know the “how” and “why” of everything on a very basic level in your business, and then someone else can do the “what” for you, the actual work. Your strengths will ultimately make you money.  1:28:38 – 1:32:23 Why You Shouldn’t Start A Cannabis Company If You Don’t Smoke Weed  Cannabis is a good business opportunity for some now that it is being embraced and legalized, but if you're going to monetize and build a business, it should be around what you care about and you're expert in, not just what is a “good business opportunity”.  1:32:23 – 1:33:41 Chris’ Discusses Good Looking Loser Comeback  After getting Chris' businesses are on autopilot, he plans to make a comeback on Good Looking Loser focusing on:  Committed relationships How to make money How to create a website you never touch that passively makes $2,000 a month How to build a blog E-commerce stores    1:33:41 – 1:42:33 What To Do If You’re 23 Years Old And Have Underachieved With Women And Finances  You shouldn't be handling both at the same time if you're 23 years old. Seriously evaluate why you're not doing well. Derek completely focused on getting women in his late teens/early 20's with less than $100 in his bank account at nearly all times. The last thing on his mind was handling business. Focus on learning, not earning. If you don't complete the get laid phase of your life early, when you meet girls when you're in your 30's and rich, you will probably not have the emotional health or dating IQ to even realize you're being played.  1:42:33 – 1:44:56 How Your Brain Changes As You Hit 25 Years Old  Derek talks about overthinking in his early 20's and not understanding basic concepts to make money You start to see things more clearly and with a more logical perspective as you get older  1:44:56 – 1:46:24 Chris Pulls Out The GLL Bandana  Chris digs out an old GLL bandana that he used to wear back in his pick up days when it was more fashionable in L.A. Chris talks about his fashion choices during his pick up days, and how fashion is different today than it used to be.  1:46:24 – 1:49:46 Derek & Chris On What Their Current Daily Routine Looks Like  Chris' Schedule  Wake up Make Kratom and coffee Check social media Work out Shower Go to the warehouse at 11pm-6am Set up Happy Hippo for the day Read and respond to e-mails Go to bed    1:49:46 – 1:52:31 Chris On When He First Realized He Was Making An Impact Online  For Chris, it was the night of the election of Obama's second term when he faced off against Mitt Romney when a guy sent him $1,000 on PayPal with a note that just said, “Thanks, Chris, for your advice.”  1:52:31 – 1:54:28 Derek & Chris On Daily Use Of Kratom Or Phenibut  Daily use of Phenibut is dangerous and a horrible idea. Its use should be limited to 1-2 days per week at most. Daily Kratom should ideally be reserved only for those who need it for pain management.  1:54:28 – 1:56:23 Derek & Chris Discuss Hanging, Jelqing & Stretching For Increasing Your Penis Size  Chris tried hanging and worked his way up to a 25 pound plate to stretch his penis Derek talks about jelqing The discoloration that Chris got was not from Bathmate, it was from jelqing.  1:56:23 – 1:57:00 How Much Size Gain Can You Expect Using The Bathmate Alone For PE?  If you use it every day for a year or two, you could gain an inch or more in length and 1.5 inches in girth.  1:57:00 – 1:58:04 Derek & Chris On Using The Bathmate Before Having Sex 1:58:04 – 2:04:28 Is Cold Approach Still A Good Idea Nowadays?  Most men nowadays are beta males, which leads to lower competition than ever. Cold approach principles are still more or less the same. If you are above a girl's looks threshold, can hold a conversation, and she is sexually available, you will not be seen as creepy for cold approaching, and will set yourself apart from the majority of men who are glued to their phones and afraid to talk to women.  2:04:28 – 2:08:28 Results From Tinder Vs Plenty Of Fish Vs OkCupid  Tinder – The most superficial app, but easiest to succeed on if you look good. If you are good looking and have good pictures, you will do well. If you don't, then you won't do well. Period. Plenty Of Fish – This site has several more layers above and beyond pictures, but your results will still be dictated largely by your looks here.

Table of Contents ToggleHow Much Muscle Should You Expect To Gain On TestosteroneTestosterone Dose-Response In A Clinical SettingMethodologyParticipant QualificationFat-Free Mass Gain 25 mg TestosteroneFat-Free Mass Gain 50 mg TestosteroneFat-Free Mass Gain 125 mg TestosteroneFat-Free Mass Gain 300 mg TestosteroneFat-Free Mass Gain 600 mg TestosteroneStrength Change And Other Notable MarkersConclusionRelated How Much Muscle Should You Expect To Gain On Testosterone I'm constantly asked exactly how much muscle you can expect to gain from high dose testosterone, or a myriad of other performance enhancing hormones. “If I take X amount of testosterone, how many pounds will I gain?” Obviously, this isn't something you can just answer flat out. The result will be based on caloric intake, training, adherence, genetic response, Myostatin levels, and a million other factors. However, there is a great study that evaluated how much muscle gain would occur in a controlled setting using supraphysiological doses of testosterone in healthy young men. To date, this is the best study available for illustrating with exact figures what happens to men when they take low dose Testosterone vs high dose Testosterone.  Testosterone Dose-Response In A Clinical Setting This study evaluated the results of weekly administrations of Testosterone at dosages of 25 mg, 50 mg, 125 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg for 20 weeks. Keep in mind when you interpret these results that fat-free mass also accounts for water, it's not just pure muscle tissue. As you would expect, the higher these testosterone doses get, the more aromatization occurs. Therefore, more water retention, which is going to play a role here too. Methodology  Nutritional intake was controlled The exercise regimen was controlled The dose was controlled Used pharmaceutical-grade testosterone  Energy and protein intakes were standardized at 16.33 calories per pound per day, and 0.544 grams per pound per day. Participants were instructed to not partake in strength training or moderate-to-heavy endurance exercise during the study. The only thing that differed between the participants was the dosage administered. The reason this study is so eye opening is because it outlines what kind of changes can occur just from the dosage of Testosterone alone without any interfering data deriving from specific individuals who happen to have better adherence to their diet, or better training principles than another person. Participant Qualification  The participants are of 18 to 35 years old Have prior weightlifting experience Have normal natural testosterone levels Have not used anabolic agents Had not participated in competitive sports events in the preceding year Not planning to compete in any competitive sports events in the following year.  What we saw was a dose-dependent change in muscle mass and strength, which is what we would logically expect. The exact amount of muscle relative to the other dosages is what was interesting though.  Fat-Free Mass Gain 25 mg Testosterone In the 25 mg per week dosage group, fat-free mass actually went down by an average of 1 kilogram. The reason that the men administered 25 mg lost muscle is that if you take a healthy young man who has a normal in range natural testosterone level and you administer an exogenous source of Testosterone, the feedback loop in his body will shut down his natural production. A healthy young man produces between 3-10 mg of Testosterone per day with no ester attached to it. By shutting down the natural production of a young man with 25 mg of Testosterone Enanthate per week, they will actually be operating with less Testosterone than their body was naturally producing. The consequence of that is the 25 mg group actually lost muscle mass. Fat-Free Mass Gain 50 mg Testosterone The 50 mg per week dosage group gained an average of 0.6 kilograms of fat-free mass. Fat-Free Mass Gain 125 mg Testosterone The 125 mg per week dosage group gained an average of 3.4 kg of fat-free mass. Fat-Free Mass Gain 300 mg Testosterone The 300 mg per week group gained an average of 5.2 kg of fat-free mass. Fat-Free Mass Gain 600 mg Testosterone The 600 mg per week group gained an average of 7.9 kg of fat-free mass. Strength Change And Other Notable Markers Muscle volume, strength and power, hemoglobin, and IGF-I were positively correlated with Testosterone concentrations. Expectedly, changes in fat mass and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were negatively correlated with Testosterone concentrations. The higher your Testosterone level goes, the worse your lipids are going to be. Conclusion The amount of muscle gained in the 125 mg group was pretty substantial. Despite the 600 mg group's 7.9 kg increase being very impressive, it took 4.8 times as much testosterone that achieve that extra 4.5 kg fat-free mass gain. This solidifies the theory I have about Myostatin increasing in a dose-dependent manner in the body. The greater the amount of anabolic hormones are in your body, the more Myostatin your body will produce in response to inhibit you from gaining too much muscle. High dose testosterone use comes with a drastically increased risk profile for a ROI that likely doesn't justify its implementation in my opinion. If you're interested in bodybuilding pharmacology, hormone management, or just health and quality of life optimization in general, this is a good read. The study is titled “Testosterone Dose-Response Relationships in Healthy Young Men.” Disclaimer: Testosterone Enanthate was used in this study and you need to consider ester weight when interpreting the blood work results, as well as the infrequent administration frequency. Objectively, in a performance enhancing context, protein intake was low. Also, not permitting the participants to undertake strength training or moderate-to-heavy endurance exercise during the study very likely greatly impacted potential muscle accrual. However, the standardizations implemented ensured that the results were entirely derived from the differing dosages of Testosterone. The ratios of fat-free mass gain between the different participant groups still illustrate what kind of diminishing returns occur as Myostatin increases in the body, how potent of a muscle building agent Testosterone is, as well as how deleterious supraphysiological dosages of Testosterone will or will not be on health markers in blood work.

    "content": "Sensitive Assay Estradiol Test Vs Regular Estradiol Test – Which Do You Need And Why     Why You Need To Get A Sensitive Assay Estradiol Test The standard hormone profiles by default include the cheaper FDA-approved Roche ECLIA (Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay) methodology. That test is wildly inaccurate in men, unfortunately. Most men get by default when they get blood work done, and consequently receive an inaccurate result. As a result, men will get skewed results that often lead them to using aromatase inhibitors when they don't need them, or using a dosage that is too high or too low for their needs. As you can imagine, this can have detrimental effects on a man's quality of life and health, not to mention make it nearly impossible for him to nail down his Estrogen to a healthy spot. To illustrate just how significant of an issue this can be, I compared the results of a Sensitive Assay Estradiol Test to a regular Estradiol Test conducted on the same blood sample. The goal was to see how much the results of the two methods varied, and to assess whether the default Estradiol blood test is even viable for men.   Results Of My Blood Tests The first thing I looked at was my result from the default Estradiol test that most labs use. Roche ECLIA Methodology Estradiol Test Results  My estradiol levels using the traditional default Roche ECLIA methodology was 36.8 pg/mL, which is on the high end of normal. Not too high, but 30 pg/mL is my usual target. You can see the normal range is from 7.6 to 42.6 pg/mL. Some guys would see this and logically think to themselves, “Okay, so things look pretty good, maybe I could use a bit of an AI to bring me down closer to 30.” I had the same blood tested using Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) which is not an FDA approved test. As you would expect, the LC/MS/MS test is more expensive as well.  This test was developed to measure Estradiol with greatly increased sensitivity in postmenopausal women, men, children and adolescents [R]. The Sensitive Assay Estradiol test should be the default for men in my opinion, as it has vastly different results. Most men won't go out of their way to add this to their cart separately, or opt for a more expensive panel to get this included when they get their blood work done. I assure you, it's worth the additional price to see what's actually going on. Sensitive Assay Estradiol Test Results This was the result of the sensitive assay test conducted on the same sample:  As you can see in the image above, my Estradiol levels are actually only at 9.9 pg/mL. If you know how to interpret estrogen levels, you would know that a 9.9 pg/mL result, despite it being in the normal range, is on the extreme low end of normal and could very likely lead to negative outcomes.  The Potential Harm Of A False Reading On An Estradiol Test The difference between the sensitive assay estradiol test and the regular estradiol test is massive. The difference in my test result was almost 30 pg/mL, which is practically the entire reference range. If you think you're at 36.8 pg/mL and think to yourself, “Oh, I could probably use a bit of Aromasin to bring me down to 30 pg/mL,” but you're only actually at 9.9 pg/mL and then you use Aromasin and tank it even further, you can just imagine what's going to happen. Here are some of the potential side effects of low estrogen:  Dull weak orgasms Dry skin and lips Dehydration Erectile dysfunction Low libido Irritability Mood swings Loss of appetite Fatigue Lethargy Dry, achy joints Bone degeneration Decreased muscle growth Decreased fat loss  You could inadvertently cause all of these issues, and exacerbate them even further by using an inappropriate aromatase inhibitor dosage that isn't congruent with your body's actual needs. You could think you need an even higher dosage of your AI because you're having libido or ED issues, pop some Aromasin and then screw yourself up even more. This is extremely common, and often times doctors will prescribe predetermined dosages of AI's without even looking at your E2 levels at all, let alone looking at the accurate version of the test, which still baffles me to this day how much harm ignorant doctors cause to their patients on TRT with idiotic AI protocols. Conclusion It's very important that you get the Sensitive Assay Estradiol test added to your blood work if it is not already included in your panel. It's the difference between you potentially screwing yourself up and not screwing yourself up. It's especially critical if you're on TRT or PED's that you know exactly how much aromatization is actually occurring in your body. If you are crashing your E2 into the ground for no reason, you're unnecessarily impairing your health and quality of life. In the example above, I need more Estrogen in my body and should not use an AI at all, or should lower the dose accordingly if I were on one. You will operate at a much higher quality of life with E2 levels closer to 30 pg/mL rather than 9 pg/mL, as well as build more muscle.

    "content": "Minoxidil DOES NOT Prevent Hair Loss – Read This Before Using It!     Why Minoxidil Does Not Prevent Hair Loss The first thing you need to know before you start using Minoxidil is that Minoxidil does not prevent hair loss. Typically, when a man starts noticing male pattern baldness, he may go to his doctor and say, “I'm losing my hair, what do I do?” More often than not, a doctors' first recommendation will be Rogaine (Minoxidil).  What you need to understand about Minoxidil is that it does absolutely nothing to prevent hair loss, despite it being FDA approved for hair loss prevention. You need to understand the mechanism of how it works first before you start slapping this stuff on your head. There is some data that implies it may have an anti-androgen like effect, but the majority of Minoxidil's efficacy stems from its ability to increase circulation to hair follicles. Minoxidil is a vasodilator. It increases oxygen and blood flow to the scalp where you apply it. Why is that good? Well, when you start losing your hair, it is because of a mechanism of action commonly referred to as miniaturization. Androgens trigger a cascade of events that miniaturize hair follicles and prevent them from growing to maturity. When blood flow and oxygen gets cut off to hair follicles, they slowly miniaturize more and more until they are so weak that they are no longer visible to the naked eye. This is the process of androgenic alopecia. Minoxidil increases blood flow and oxygen to the hair follicles, thus encouraging growth. . That's why you would otherwise not be able to maintain Minoxidil-dependent hairs grown by Minoxidil, as that level of circulation would otherwise be impossible to sustain if it weren't for Minoxidil application sustaining it.  Understand and Address Androgen Miniaturization First The main male sex hormone is testosterone. This hormone converts via 5-alpha reductase into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is multiple-fold more androgenic than testosterone is. Not only does Testosterone bind to hair follicles itself and miniaturize them, but DHT does as well. DHT is much more effective than testosterone at miniaturizing hair follicles because it has a much higher binding affinity for the androgen receptor.  Basically, if you use Minoxidil, while you may be encouraging more growth and better growth on your head, you're still doing nothing to prevent the endogenous androgens in your body from miniaturizing hair follicles. You might be able to visually offset hair loss because you're growing hair at a faster and better rate. Despite Minoxidil being capable of growing better looking, thicker, denser hair, if you're doing nothing to prevent your existing healthy hairs from falling out of your head still, you will eventually continue losing ground. If you only take Minoxidil, even if you do experience improved hair growth, all of your existing healthy hairs will still be miniaturized. Eventually, you're going to get to a point where despite however many Minoxidil-dependent hairs you've grown, the healthy ones that miniaturize via androgens will offset the amount that you've grown with Minoxidil. By that time, you're going to start to notice receding and/or diffuse thinning again. The first thing you should be doing is tackling miniaturization from androgens as opposed to throwing growth agonists into your protocol. Minoxidil Side Effects Minoxidil is probably the most side effect-ridden hair loss prevention drug. I got brutal water retention from Minoxidil. I know people who have had severe heart palpitations from it. I've seen people who have had their face aged from it. One of my friends even experiences Orthostatic Hypotension induced fainting from Minoxidil. Every time he stood up, he would pass out from low blood pressure, and he also indirectly had Tachycardia as a result.  He would walk around with a resting heart rate above 100 and pass out intermittently throughout the day. Despite the half-life being less than 24 hours, it can take months for this to correct itself even after discontinuation of Minoxidil [R]. It's actually more common to get side effects from Minoxidil than most other hair loss prevention treatments in my experience.  Minoxidil Should Be the Last Thing You Add to Your Hair Loss Protocol I wouldn't advise Minoxidil off the bat because it's not actually protecting your hair. Most of the reported side effects of Minoxidil are cardiovascular related, which is the main thing I'd be concerned about as opposed to androgen deficiencies or hormonal imbalances that can be manually corrected with greater ease. Not to mention that any hair grown with Minoxidil is Minoxidil dependent, meaning you will likely experience a substantial shed should you discontinue its use, regardless of what else you're using for protection. This shed can be mentally taxing, and traps a lot of men into staying on Minoxidil even when they want to come off, as they don't want to induce severe telogen effluvium. This is another big factor to keep in mind before you start Minoxidil, as you will likely be on it for life once you start, unless you are able to persevere through the shedding phases. Obviously, everyone has their own individual response to everything. There's always going to be a few people who respond poorly to drugs. There are a lot of people who will have no issues with topical Minoxidil too. This is just where I stand on its risk to reward ratio. The foundation of your hair loss protection regimen should be based upon protecting yourself from androgens induced miniaturization. Once you're protected from further miniaturization or have minimized it, then focus on regrowth and improving the density of your hair with growth agonists if necessary. Conclusion While there are obviously cases where you could visually offset hair loss to such an extent where it appears you haven't lost any ground for a few years, or even potentially decades after you start Minoxidil treatment alone, the fact remains that you have androgens in your system that are miniaturizing healthy hair follicles, however slowly. Minoxidil can only grow so much to offset that loss. Eventually, the loss is going to outweigh the amount of new hair you've grown with Minoxidil. It's also the most hassle-ridden treatment in my opinion, as it requires two daily applications which can result in your hair looking greasy 24/7. Again, my advice would be to deal with androgens first. Once you've established your foundation of protection, then you can move on to growth agonists like Minoxidil if needed.

    "content": "Steve Cook Finally Admits He’s Not Natural | But Do You Really Care?     Steve Cook Admits He's Not Natural Steve Cook is one of the most widely respected and liked influencers in the fitness industry. Personally, I don't religiously watch his content so I am not sure if he has ever blatantly claimed he is natural. From what I can tell, he seems to tread a fine line of going out of his way to avoid talking about it. He has never blatantly stated he is or is not natural, and it is always brought up indirectly in a comedic way. He has often implied that he is natural as well in his videos.   These are a couple old videos I found linked on Reddit where Steve skirts around the topic and implies he is natural. It sounds like he's actually going to come out and make a video addressing it directly now though based on a recent update where he has stated that he is not natural. Some are surprised, and some aren't. Personally, it didn't surprise me at all, and I would bet money that anybody in the fitness industry that's close to 35 or over is probably at least on TRT.  Steve Cook's Upcoming Natty or Not Reveal Assumptions My assumption is that the video he comes out with is going to be addressing his age and Testosterone (steroids) in a hormonal optimization context, rather than performance enhancement. You don't just walk around at 215 lbs, 9-10% body fat without using some sort of performance enhancing exogenous anabolics. It doesn't come as any surprise to me. What I am curious about is whether he will use a TRT cop out, or if he will actually address supraphysiological blast phases that he very likely used throughout his career to get the physique he has.  It's funny because I have some close friends who are into bodybuilding that have higher than average bodybuilding IQ's who've asked if I think Steve Cook is natural. Steve Cooks years skirting the subject and just general healthy approach to bodybuilding in his content often give off the impression that he must be natural to those who are less educated about how hormones work. It's entirely possible he's only on TRT right now, but my educated guess is that he's pushed his androgen index above and beyond that in the past several times, and he sustains his current physique with high-normal therapeutic dosages of Testosterone. I doubt he blasts high dosages of anything anymore now that he isn't competing and isn't actively chasing size. Should We Really Care If Steve Cook Is Natural Or Not? When these icons in the fitness industry like Steve Cook have gone out of their way to dodge the subject and closet their “natural” status for a decade, I can understand why something like this would be a big deal to a lot of people, especially his fans, because it creates unrealistic expectations. Not to mention how many of these icons have peddled supplements that have a 1% impact (if even) on performance outcomes in the gym without being transparent about their drug usage. Even if we were discussing Testosterone usage in just a TRT context, you can't get shredded and maintain 900 – 1000 ng/dL Testosterone levels unless you're using exogenous TRT. TRT gives a significant performance enhancing advantage, even in just a therapeutic context when it comes to bodybuilding outcomes. If he's going to make that argument about how it's the equivalent to being natural when you're in your 30s, to me that will be the ultimate cop out. It remains to be seen how he will address the subject, but I hope he is actually transparent about it and doesn't try to sugar coat it to make himself look better to his audience. As far as this whole Natty Verified movement that prompted Steve coming out about his lifetime status, I have posted a more elaborate video on that.

    "title": "The Truth About Synthol | Misconceptions Debunked",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/the-truth-about-synthol/",
    "date": "2019-06-04T18:00:21+00:00",
    "content": "The Truth About Synthol | Misconceptions Debunked     The Truth About Synthol There's a huge misconception about what Synthol actually is. Synthol is a form of SEO, also known as Site Enhancement Oil. SEO is commonly used by bodybuilders to increase the size of a lagging muscle group, or to re-shape it. I see articles and videos pop up all the time centered around individuals who have ruined their physiques with extreme site enhancement experimentation.   These guys you see in these freak videos with ballooned arms, shoulders, and chests that have no visible muscle on their frame to begin with are not indicative of traditional Synthol use.  Extreme “Synthol” Abusers Bodybuilders are extremely insecure in general. It all stems down to self-esteem, body image, and the way you want to portray yourself. As you've seen in these extreme videos and pictures, these guys are so insecure about themselves that they'll take gobs of oil and shove it into body parts hoping that it gets them viewed as the most jacked guy in the room. They literally think that they can just shove a bunch of oil in their arms and get a 21-inch arm overnight without even having a foundation of muscle. Synthol abuse stems from impatience, and an extremely skewed perception of self-worth. Typically, these freaks see some instant results from jabbing some oil into themselves, and then get addicted to the quick results. They get so addicted to the quick results that they can't perceive how ridiculous it really looks. If you actually tried to buy a private label brand like Syntherol or Painless Pumps (or any other Synthol product), the amount of money it would cost you to get the amount of oil these guys are jabbing into their arms, and other body parts that are in these videos, would be unaffordable for the majority of people. Moreover, these guys aren't just taking your standard run-of-the-mill Synthol products, these guys are literally taking giant bottles of any oil they can find and jabbing it into themselves. These disasters that you see are guys taking thousands of milliliters of olive oil (or other kinds of cheap oil) and just jamming it into muscle groups. These individuals are not representative of Synthol use in bodybuilding. Synthol Use In The Bodybuilding Industry Synthol use in the bodybuilding industry is taboo and rarely touched on, but it's common nonetheless. Synthol is exactly what a lot of bodybuilders are using, or have at least tried before, but it is used in a much more calculated way, and is typically reserved for bringing up a lagging body part that is already well developed.  That's how bodybuilders use it, and they mostly all get away with it. No one calls them out because it's unnoticeable the majority of the time. If you take a developed body part, and then you pin it with some oil, you're not going to notice much deformation until it gets to a point where too much oil is being pinned into the same spot, it's not being distributed evenly, the shots are too shallow, or an infection occurs. Getting to the point where you've permanently deformed your arm or your chest to the point that you have a giant bubble muscle like these freaks you see online would take thousands of milliliters of oil, and nobody in their right mind is going to do that. There's a huge misconception where people think that just one shot of Synthol with ruin a physique Synthol abuse is a gradual and very obvious progression of ruining your physique. You'd have to be an idiot to let it happen because it takes dozens, if not hundreds of these shots to get to that point if you are using a body part with a good foundation of muscle. For most bodybuilders with a lot of muscle on their frame, they could go buy a 100 milliliter bottle of Synthol and pin 3 cc's into all of their body parts and nobody would even notice a difference. That's just the body metabolizes that sterile oil the exact same way it metabolizes fats in the body. Synthol is literally just sterile oil. The Synthol abusers got to a point where they've stretched their fascia out so much that there's just no coming back to a normal looking physique. The guys who do Synthol injections sensically step on stage and nobody is the wiser the majority of the time, barring unexpected outcomes like infections, hitting nerves, and so on. I don't condone its use, I simply want to shed light on this widely misunderstood practice. Bodybuilders Who Use Synthol It's actually more common to get an infection from gear than it is to end up with a ruined body part via Synthol experimentation. Even the freak accident shot Bostin Loyd had where he hit a nerve and his arm ballooned up like crazy which resulted in permanent scarring was a steroid injection, not a synthol injection.  If Bostin Loyd wasn't so public about everything, no one would even guess that he's used Synthol. Prior to his botched tricep shot with gear, you would just assume that he has great arm genetics.  When you see Flex Wheeler, the first thing you think would probably not be that he uses Synthol. All you can see when you look at Flex are crazy elite genetics and full muscle bellies.    In reality, he does have the most insane bodybuilding genetics ever, but he still used Synthol, and so did a lot of other pro-bodybuilders in the 90s. His site enhancement use in the past is obvious now that he has lost a significant amount of his foundation of muscle.  People are still using Synthol to this day, it's a very commonplace thing in the IFBB. Correlation Between Synthol and Steroids Synthol use has such a negative perception that almost nobody discusses it openly. At the end of the day, even if you use steroids, you're technically using Synthol because the literal steroid hormone is suspended in oil, and you're putting the oil into yourself. If you pin oil without hormones in it, then that's bad. But pinning gear with hormone in it is fine? All Synthol is, is just sterile oil without hormones in it, and when you take steroids, it's also just sterile oil, but with active compound suspended in it. That's the only difference.  “Synthol consists usually of oil, benzyl alcohol and lidocain. It consists of 85% of oil (normally it is oil built by medium-length MTC chains because it gives the best effects), 7,5% of lidocain (painkiller), 7,5% of alcohol (to sterilize the mixture)” [R]. The only reason why Synthol has a localized hypertrophic effect is because people are putting so much volume in their muscle bellies that it's forcing the muscle to stretch out to accommodate the oil being injected into it. At the end of the day, it's just sterile oil and it's being demonized like its some sort of fake implant used for plastic surgery. If you've pinned gear before, you've technically pinned sterile oil, which is exactly what Synthol is. Synthol Misconceptions Debunked The only thing that differentiates a Synthol freak from everyone else who discretely uses it in the bodybuilding industry is the fact that the freaks are intentionally putting thousands of milliliters of oil into body parts that aren't developed. If someone shoves hundreds of milliliters of anything in a body part, it's going to have to stretch out to accommodate that lack of space in the fascia. That's just common sense. These Synthol freaks are not representative of what the point of Synthol use is in a bodybuilding context. The really inflamed botched shots you see online in bodybuilders who are actually competing in shows are typically the result of steroid infections. More often than not, these infections occur from bad shots of water-based drugs. Bodybuilders who still show up on stage with infections are immediately labeled as poster boys for Synthol abuse, when it often isn't the case at all.   More often than not, it actually has nothing to do with the Synthol. In Dexter Jackson's case, this was probably a torn muscle, or a bad injection (watch the video, as the thumbnail is photoshopped). Yes, you could have an infection from an injection of Synthol, but it's actually far more common for guys to get these freak accident infections with water based compounds and suspensions pre-contest. It's much less common to get a freak accident infection from hormone-free sterile oil. Synthol is just sterilized MCT oil at the end of the day, not some magical compound that will transform body parts.

    "content": "Crazy Fat Loss Face Transformation | 25% To Single Digit Body Fat     Incels Getting Facial Surgery My face transformation from fat loss was pretty extreme. I think sharing mine will help give some of you guys some pretty good insight into just how much of a difference fat and water retention really has on facial aesthetics. I've come to realize over the years that there are a significant amount of men who truly believe they have horrible face genetics. Some of these men even think that they need plastic surgery in order to become attractive.  Obviously there are actually cases of guys with blatant structural deficiencies like recessed jawlines, poor cheekbones, odd shaped heads, etc. In most cases though, the men making this judgment call on their facial aesthetics haven't even seen what they could really look like naturally. Once you get shredded, you can actually see what you're working with. A significant portion of the guys who think they have really bad face genetics do not, they just are too fat. My Body Fat Loss and Face Transformation Take me as an example. The picture on the left is of me at about 20%+ body fat, and the picture on the right is me at single digit body fat. (leftover spray tan from a physique competition in the right picture) This face transformation was the result an extremely dirty bulk I did, followed by an extreme cut I did where I got really lean. The weight difference was about 45 pounds in the image above. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the massive difference being lean has on my facial aesthetics. I'm almost unrecognizable in the before and afters. I used to be convinced my facial structure was terrible. It wasn't until I got really lean that I realized that I actually wasn't dealt too shabby of a hand in the genetic lottery. Get Leaner = Become More Attractive To Women First of all, you need to realize that in order to get attractive women, you only need to meet the minimum looks threshold that women have. If you've met their individual requirements, you're not a complete idiot in regards to social communication, she's single and looking to meet somebody, you don't need to be a 10/10 to get 10/10 women, regardless of what you may have been led to believe on PUA forums. Anytime you see an attractive girl you can almost always assume that they have likely been with somebody who's worse looking than you at some point in the past. For every attractive woman you see, there chances are extremely slim that every single guy she was with beat you out in the looks department. So many men think they're so inhibited by their face, but it is almost always because they just haven't ever truly been lean. They won't eat properly, they won't do cardio, and often they won't even lift weights consistently, but then they assume that they need facial surgery. Facial Aesthetics Are Largely Dictated By Fat Content This face transformation is intended to illustrate how extreme results can be achieved solely via body fat loss. I don't think the majority of men realize how substantial of an impact fat and water retention has on their sex appeal. It's very rare for a guy to look terrible compared to his former self when he's finally gotten shredded. Granted, things like acne, skin quality, wrinkles, and other complexion related factors will play a major role on your sex appeal. But, the meat and potatoes of your sex appeal will be dictated by how lean your face is. The structure of your face is dictated entirely by fat content. Get down to a single digit body fat percentage and then make a more informed assessment of your face. Do not believe that the only way to improve yourself is cosmetic surgery because your perception is that you got the short end of the genetic stick. More often than not this is not actually the case. There are countless examples of guys' before and afters that had such average looking faces who all ended up looking great once they got lean. Here are some of the before and afters of fat vs lean faces:     It's not rocket science, most men can go from ugly to good looking simply by losing fat. I've lost count of how many guys I have seen online talk about cosmetic procedures like jaw implants, repositioning bones and teeth, and other extreme surgical interventions before they've even tried to get down to single digit body fat percentage one time. Get lean first and make an assessment of what needs to be fixed, because it's quite likely that you don't need any surgery at all. Is Getting Plastic Surgery Ever A Good Idea? I'm not anti-plastic surgery. If you have a destroyed nose and you look like your face has been shoveled, then yes, consider getting a nose job. However, “most” people can will look great just by getting lean and they don't realize it. So please, for the sake of your dating life, get lean once, and then see what you're working with. Then make an educated assessment afterwards. At the end of the day, facial aesthetics are king over everything else. Fortunately, it's one of the easiest things to max out, most guys are just too lazy and uneducated to go do it.

    "content": "Stan Efferding’s Vertical Diet Review | Results After 1 Year     My Goals When I Started Stan Efferding's Vertical Diet Stan Efferding's Vertical Diet fills both macro and micronutrient needs, which are otherwise left unmet by standard, traditional bodybuilding diet models. I started Stan Efferding's vertical diet mid-2018. These were my goals: Main Goals During The Vertical Diet:  Upregulate thyroid function as much as possible  Monitored via regular waking and midday body temperature readings, blood work, hair shedding (I can tell when there is even a slight shift in regards to this), and overall energy levels.   Enhanced cognitive function  Avoiding intense blood sugar fluctuation induced mental comas and hitting micronutrient needs should take care of this, but this remains to be seen   Optimize gut health  Pretty easy to monitor how well my body is processing foods. I will be also looking at inflammation levels in lab work to see how I respond internally to these foods   Hit all micronutrient needs  Secondary Goals:  Increase HDL cholesterol  I have low HDL levels. I’ve had low levels for a couple years now actually, and I’ve just left it completely unaddressed. Adding in Citrus Bergamot and Cardio only helps so much when you’re on TRT and genetically predisposed to crap HDL levels. I’m hoping the diet can fix this. I will determine this by comparing mid-diet blood work to my baseline blood work.   See how optimal sodium, potassium and water levels will impact body composition, performance and overall recovery.  Sodium and Potassium are two parts of diet that I’ve never measured. I also never knew how misguided some of the information is on sodium. Much of it coming right from our own Government. I will be consuming 8 grams of sodium a day alongside my regular 1+ gallon of water I drink per day and monitoring changes closely   Decrease resting heart rate and blood pressure  My resting heart rate is about 65-70 right now. I would be a lot happier if it was closer to the high 50’s. My blood pressure averages about 125/75, although sometimes it goes as high as 129/80 at rest. I want to try and bring this down, and am hoping that proper mineral/electrolyte balance, HITT cardio, and the other parts of the diet will help accomplish this.    It has almost been a year now, and the diet checked almost every single goal off on this list. My Thyroid hormones returned to homeostasis, I'm mentally sharper, my metabolism is noticeably faster and my health markers look better than ever in my blood work. My resting heart rate has come down to 60 beats per minute, and my blood pressure is down to 120/70. If I really relax before taking my blood pressure and give myself 5-10 minutes to chill out, I can score as low as 115/65. The only thing that I couldn't fix with the Vertical Diet was my HDL cholesterol. It improved, but is still not in the reference range. As far elaborate details on exactly how the foods in the vertical diet affected my blood work markers like inflammation levels, cholesterol levels, etc. you can go look at my Vertical Diet logs I've written, where I literally do a new round of blood work per every four weeks or so to show what little changes in the diet did to my blood work and my health markers. The following is a general overview of my results, and a review of the diet itself.  Quality of Life and Energy Levels My quality of life and energy levels went up fairly noticeably after starting the vertical diet. When I started the vertical diet, one of the first things I did notice was that it was a lot easier to get out of bed in the morning, whereas before, I would probably hit snooze about 10 times. On the vertical diet, I would just wake up to my alarm and then get out of bed. It was a lot easier of a transition than it would have been otherwise on a standard micronutrient deficient diet. I don't think people realize how much of a difference micronutrients fulfillment not only have on basic health markers and longevity, but as well as how you feel during the day. It really makes a huge difference on your energy levels and how your diet translates into your everyday productivity, efficiency and ability to really make the most of each hour. Granted, a lot of my weaknesses aren't just magically solved by the diet. You're probably still going to be a procrastinator if you don't take steps to fix that. But as far as blatantly noticing energy improvement, I was able to stay awake longer if I needed to. I don't suggest staying up longer than 16-17 hours though as it goes against the principles of the diet in the first place, which is adequate rest and recovery. Also, when you do get adequate rest and recovery, you wake up a lot easier than you would otherwise on the same amount of sleep. That's one of the main things I realized. All Diet Models Will Have Individually Dependent Results As far as how the red meat affects your blood markers. One thing I've realized is vertical diet is very individually dependent. There are certain genetic mutations and alleles and things of that nature that will greatly affect if something like the vertical diet is going to be healthy or not for you. In general, most people will succeed with the diet and improve health markers. However, it's not a blanket statement of what will work or not work for you. You'll have arguments between vegans and carnivore diet people about how meat is bad, meat is good, vegan diets are bad and vegan diets are good, etc. For example, if you have a genetic propensity to destroyed lipids from foods like eggs, then eating eggs every day will negatively impact your lipids. If you have Hashimotos Thyroiditis and you increase your Iodine intake too quickly you can severely aggravate your condition. When it comes to lipid modulation and eggs, so many people will reference one study where it showed that eggs didn't have any negative effect on HDL, LDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides. This study was conducted on a cohort of individuals. Regardless of what “experts” want to tell you, study results do not equate to an accurate blanket statement for every single person. My LDL And Cholesterol Spiked From Eggs If you go look at my vertical diet updates, you can blatantly see how detrimental of an impact just having four eggs a day had on my LDL and total cholesterol. Within just a few weeks, the Vertical Diet had increased my total cholesterol and LDL by 50%.  That was what happened to me, meanwhile other individuals might be able to eat four eggs per day and see no difference in their blood work. But for me in particular though, it totally destroyed my cholesterol levels and barely improved my HDL, which was the main thing I was hoping to get out of it. This is mainly due to my TRT use. If you're on TRT, you probably have low HDL too, or it is on the low end of the reference range. Getting it into the high end of the reference range is a struggle and it's very rare for a guy on TRT to have exceptional HDL. I was hoping for a big boost in HDL with no effect on LDL from this diet model. But it just wasn't the case with the four eggs daily. I checked whether taking out the eggs without altering my red meat consumption would resolve the LDL and total cholesterol spike because I didn't want to take out both at the same time and skew the results. If my lipids corrected themselves, I would have no idea if it was the eggs or the red meat. So, all I did after getting those terrible lipid results back was take out the eggs and kept my one pound of red meat in per day. I was eating one pound of ground bison per day still and removing the eggs completely reversed the issue. It was 100% a result of the eggs, and I still eat the red meat every single day with no issues on my lipid profile. You can begin to see how this is individually dependent. It's not a knock to the vertical diet though, it's just something you have to take into consideration because a lot of times you'll read blanket statements about food groups that aren't necessarily true for all individuals. The Importance Of Genetic Testing Obviously, eggs are not in my diet now. I get my Vitamin K2, Choline and Biotin from supplements now. Just because there's a study showing one thing is healthy for a certain subsection of the population, it doesn't mean it's applicable to you. If you get genetic testing done you could find you have some like abnormal mutation where your body doesn't process Mercury correctly, or you're prone to high cholesterol, or a ton of other obscure health markers you would never even consider that could have a massive impact on your health. And then at that point, all these things that are totally harmless to the general population could screw you up big time. These are very minuscule details that aren't typically considered when people are trying to make blanket statements about if a diet model is healthy or not. One thing I can say is that the vertical diet covers your bases in terms of making it very, very idiot proof to hit all your micronutrients and macronutrient needs, which is great. But once you do hit all those needs, you have to do follow up extensive bloodwork (as well as genetic testing ideally) to see if there are certain foods in the diet that just aren't going to be compatible with your genetic profile. More often than not, there are one or two things in your current diet that are going to screw you up if you don't know what you're looking at when it comes to your health markers. If something works for somebody, it doesn't mean it's going to work for you. Personally, everything else in the diet besides the eggs was very complementary to my needs and I had no issues with anything else other than that. Stan Efferding's Vertical Diet Is Perfect For Anyone Looking To Gain Muscle And Stay Lean I believe the vertical diet is best suited for those who are trying to gain muscle and stay leaner while gaining that muscle. This is perfect for bodybuilders, strong men and powerlifters who have to slam tons of food and stay hungry while doing it.  If you bodybuild too, you'll attest to the fact that eventually you hit a sticking point in your bulk where you're either too fat and shouldn't keep bulking, or you hit a point where food is just so repulsive to you that you can't increase your caloric intake anymore without feeling like you're force-feeding yourself to keep growing. Many will turn to junk food at this point to push past the plateau of constantly feeling full. If you hit a point where you're literally forced to eat junk food to get your calories in your putting your health in jeapordy just to continue gaining weight. A lot of people will say get your calories in no matter what and go eat McDonald's if you need to. You would be much better suited doing something like the vertical diet where you can still have a completely optimized diet for health, longevity, blood markers, and organ health without having to compromise your quality of life just to hit a calorie allotment. It keeps you very hungry and your metabolism will be as maxed out as it could possibly be from any diet model. It's extremely well-suited for gaining lean muscle and strength, as well as revving up your metabolism. Difficulty Of Dietary Adherence In A Calorie Deficit The Vertical Diet is great for bulking and recomposition phases, but for people who are trying to stay lean year round, it is a difficult diet model to adhere to. It isn't suboptimal, it is simply difficult to adhere to. The Vertical Diet boosts your metabolism up so you stay hungry all day, which is great as nutrients are partitioned better, your insulin sensitivity stays on point and you're not consuming crappy foods. You're using exactly what you need to meet your personal performance and recovery needs. However, if you're in a calorie deficit, eating calorie-dense foods like eggs, red meat, almonds, full-fat greek yogurt, in addition to having shots of sugar from cranberry juice and oranges throughout the day to stimulate your metabolism can put you in a predicament where you are hungrier than ever, and are still eating minimally satiating foods. If you're cutting, you can switch to whole oranges instead of orange juice and make a few other diet alterations to get a bit more fiber in to be more satiating, but you are a bit limited when it comes to getting really shredded on the vertical diet. I found staying in a calorie deficit on the vertical diet pretty difficult personally. At the start of the diet where you're still eating 3,000+ calories, it's not bad. But once you start restricting yourself to less than 2700 calories, if you have a decent amount of muscle and you're following the vertical diet perfectly you'll likely find it quite difficult to stick and adhere to a perfect diet model without deviating and cheating on your diet. This is because the diet is designed to keep you hungry all day long and to only consume low digestive stress foods. The diet is designed to not bog down your digestive system on purpose, which is great. But at the same time, there aren't enough food groups in there that you can use that will satiate you and hit all your macronutrient needs simultaneously. I find myself finishing a meal and being hungry still. I can't use my diet hacks for satiation either because they're not vertical diet-friendly. Zero nutrient foods with artificial sweeteners and other things that I used to use solely for satiation purposes are not vertical diet-friendly because they're not necessarily healthy for you. You have so much of your daily calorie allotment dedicated to hitting micronutrient needs that by the time you're done that (the horizontal portion of the diet) and you hit the vertical portion of the diet where you're eating your red meat and your rice in a steep deficit you could already be very close to your calorie limit.  At that point, your entire diet is basically comprised of random almonds, oranges, carrots, sweet potato, cranberry juice, chicken stock, whole-fat greek yogurt, eggs, etc. Before you know it, you're at 2,000+ calories, and then you only have room for one red meat and rice meal, and you're just hungry all day long. It's just not conducive to a steep deficit in my opinion. Sure, you can swap certain things like red meat for chicken or fish, eggs for egg whites, and so on. But then at that point, you're missing the horizontal portion of the diet where you're getting your micronutrient needs met, and then you're not really doing the vertical diet at all. Do not misinterpret what I'm saying here though, there's nothing wrong with the vertical diet. If you're trying to get shredded you've already personally accepted that you are going to be putting yourself in a state of micronutrient deficiency to some extent if you're trying to meet all of your dietary needs with whole foods. There's simply not enough room to meet your macronutrient needs while simultaneously hitting all your micronutrient needs when you're in 1,000+ calorie deficit to get super shredded. These are things to keep in mind if you're going to go on the vertical diet. It becomes very difficult to fit everything in when you're on sub-2,500 calorie diet while doing cardio on top of that, which makes you even hungrier. You'll probably be too hungry, even without the cardio at sub-2500 calories on this kind of diet model. For those who are trying to gain lean, gain some muscle and lose some fat simultaneously in a recomposition, or just flat out really bulk up, the vertical diet is perfect. For those in a steep deficit, the principles of the vertical diet should still be incorporated. But, there are deviations from the diet you will have to make if you don't want to suffer to an extent that only the most elite of willpower could adhere to. Once you hit all your micro needs with all of these non-satiating foods, you have very minimal room left for getting any significant amount of red meat or rice in. What diet model is best for you all depends on your individual goals and needs. Obviously depriving yourself year-round of certain nutrients isn't congruent to optimized health practices, so it is not a knock on the vertical diet at all, or any diet model for that matter when it comes to hitting your macro and micro needs simultaneously when you're intentionally restricting yourself of sufficient calories. The Vertical Diet Hits All Your Micronutrient and Macronutrient Needs I promise you that you're very likely deficient in something very important that you're not addressing, and I find the vertical diet is best for just idiot-proofing the whole process. If you follow the horizontal portion to a T, you're covered. And then with the vertical portion you're covered for muscle and strength gain. The diet incorporates the most digestion-friendly choices of protein and carbs that you could be using for recovery, building muscle, building strength, and staying hungry to continue hitting your meal allotments. I recommend anyone try it regardless if you're cutting or not, just so you can see what it's like. Hitting your micronutrient needs can substantially change your quality of life. You'd be surprised how your body responds once you hit all of these requirements that you didn't even know you're deficient in. Your performance, your ability to get up and get going, and even things you didn't think were regulated by your diet like your mood are factors that are all optimized once you start putting the right fuel in your body and stop eating crap. My Vertical Diet Review I highly recommend you guys try it. Your quality of life will likely go up, your energy levels will likely go up, your metabolism will speed up as you hit micronutrient needs that you didn't even know you were deficient in, and your body essentially becomes a fine tuned machine as you really get into it. If you haven't or you've been on the fence about it, I'm going to include a link at the bottom of this article where you can go check it out. It's a diet model that I think 99% of people could benefit from at least exploring and looking into it, or trying out once. It's important to understand what you're leaving on the table by not eating correctly. The Vertical Diet saves you so much time that you would otherwise spend researching to try and create an overarching user-friendly diet model with optimized health outcomes. Regardless of how much you care about muscle, strength and overall physical performance, the health portion of your diet is extremely important and should not be neglected.

    "title": "Reacting To Brandon Harding’s Steroid Cycle Reveal | Was It Overkill?",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/brandon-harding-steroid-cycle/",
    "date": "2019-05-30T18:00:54+00:00",
    "content": "Reacting To Brandon Harding’s Steroid Cycle Reveal | Was It Overkill?     Brandon Harding's Steroid Cycle I've been asked to cover Brandon Harding's steroid cycle that he used in his last competition.  I found this video interesting because Brandon Harding is in the mainstream fitness industry niche. He has a big channel and a big following, and he's probably the biggest in the mainstream to really break down what he's doing dose by dose, compound by compound. I wanted to react to his video live and outline what my thoughts are on what he's using and the doses he's using. This is Brandon Harding's Steroid Cycle:  Testosterone Propionate – 150 mg per week Trenbolone Acetate – 300 mg per week Masteron Propionate – 150 mg per week Clenbuterol – 120 mcg per day T3 – 75 mcg per day Arimidex 1 mg every 3-4 days Anavar – 50 mg per day Winstrol – 100 mg per day Proviron – 75 mg per day   Brandon Harding's Oral DHT Derivatives The first part of Brandon's cycle I'm going to touch on are the orals. Here's what he said: “Oxandrolone, this is essentially Anavar, and it's a hardening agent. I take 50 mg of this every single morning.” “Next we have Stano. This is Winstrol. I take 50 mg of this in the morning, 50 mg on the nighttime.” “Proviron – this shit is so strong. It really draws you out around the midsection and everywhere, especially on the legs. I take 75 mg of this in the morning.” For somebody of his size and what he's trying to do, I don't really think he needs three oral DHT derivatives, being Anavar (Oxandrolone), Winstrol (Stanozolol), and Proviron, to be honest. I think he could have easily gotten away with just Winstrol or just Anavar in that scenario. I feel like all three of them in unison is kind of overkill. Not to mention they're all going to destroy his hair. He's still really young, so he probably hasn't lost 50% density yet, but it'll get there. Once he notices it, he's going to regret having used unnecessary DHT derivatives for low level bodybuilding competitions. Clenbuterol Usage “Clenbuterol, the fatburner of the natural world. I was taking 40 mg, then I was taking 80, and as of the past five days, I've been taking 120. It makes me feel like I'm going to a heart attack.” 120 mcg of Clenbuterol? God damn. The common broscience limit of Clen is 120 mcg, where they say it starts becoming dangerous after 120 mcg. Clenbuterol is so toxic to the heart. It's probably the most unhealthy drug in bodybuilding. Very rarely would you need as much as 120 mcg. Typically when I ran it I would start as low as 10 mcg, and I would titrate up very slowly until I got to 80, to 100 mcg. When I titrated up slowly, I never had to get it up to 120 mcg. I probably would have stopped at 80 personally. If you titrate slow enough, beta cell downregulation is not an issue during a contest prep. T3 and Arimidex Usage “T3 – this is to stop my thyroid from slowing down and to basically allow me to continue to burn fat.” If you're using exogenous T3 (thyroid hormone), it doesn't stop your thyroid from slowing down like he says. Rather, it actually further slows it down by suppressing natural endogenous hormone production, and you're now operating on exogenous hormone support at this point. It doesn't slow down anything, you're actually shutting down your thyroid production when you use T3. You're basically putting yourself into a supraphysiological state on purpose to burn higher amounts of fat. “I'll take 25 mcg in the morning, 25 midday, and 25 on the nighttime. Arimidex, I'll take one of these every three to four days. This is to decrease side effects.” 25 mcg of T3 three times per day would flatten you out. Anytime I went over 50 mcg, I started to get into catabolic territory, regardless of what I was running. Most bodybuilders who've done this and know what they're doing would never cross 50 mcg of T3 unless they're on huge amounts of steroids and don't care. With T3, there's definitely a threshold where more is not better, and it just really flattens you out. Regardless of what people say in terms of anabolic support, T3 is going to rip muscle off of you like nothing else. It doesn't care or distinguish between stored body fat or stored muscle protein, it'll just rip through your muscle. When you get over 50 mcg, even if you're on Trenbolone and Testosterone, you'll start noticing you just get really flat. I've never had good experiences with T3 past 50 mcg, personally. I think 75 is overkill. Regarding Arimidex, I guess it can decrease side effects like he says, that isn't entirely incorrect, but it is a bit misleading. To clarify, it's aromatization induced high estrogen side effects that Arimidex will help alleviate, and it's dependent on what you're using. If you're not using enough aromatizing drugs and you're on a myriad of DHT derivatives, using an AI would be nonsensical. Testosterone Propionate Usage “I'll be doing half a mL of this (Testosterone Propionate), Monday, Wednesday and Friday.” Okay, so let's just assume it's dosed at 100 mg/ml, which most Test Prop vials are, so he's using 150 mg a week. I'm not a huge fan of that frequency, doing Monday, Wednesday, Friday because there's that spare day where you're having some hormone fluctuation that's unnecessary. But, it's kind of negligible, I guess. 150 mg if Test Prop is pretty reasonable. I don't know how much more than that do you need when you're trying to cut for a competition and get as dry as possible. I don't think it justifies any Arimidex usage though. It's interesting that Arimidex is included at all in this cycle, especially with that many DHT derivatives to antagonize whatever potential aromatization you could have going on. My TRT is 100 mg of Prop per week, and I don't even use an AI, let alone a really intense one like Arimidex at a full 1 mg dosage. With all those DHT derivatives and with that low of a dose of Testosterone you shouldn't even need an AI at that point in my opinion. I would bet his bloodwork would confirm that he didn't need the AI either. Masteron Usage “I'll be doing Masteron half a mL, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.” I guess the Masteron is probably 100 mg/ml again, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Again, not a huge fan of the frequency, personally. 150 mg a week is responsible, but it's pretty negligible in my opinion for prepping for a show. Masteron is very androgenic and it's great for drying out and hardening up when you're at low body fat percentage. It's probably the best DHT derivative there is for getting stage ready dry. I used to run Masteron at 400 mg per week to prep for competitions when I was younger, and anything under 300 mg per week I feel is a bit low for the purpose it is intended. Trenbolone Acetate Usage “Tren Ace is a fast-acting Tren, and I'll be taking 1 mL of this every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.” I'm assuming his Tren is 100 mg/ml doing three shots a week, so that's 300 mg a week. I'd probably run the Masteron higher and the Tren lower, personally. Because at his size (he's probably around my size), you don't need that much gear, especially when you factor in the high doses of orals. Brandon Harding's steroid cycle is a bit overkill in my opinion, and some of the ratios don't make a lot of sense. If it were me, I would probably not even run the orals at all, and just run much higher Masteron. Assuming I didn't care about my hair, I would do high Masteron and probably keep the Tren closer to what the Testosterone dosage was, and that would be it. That would be perfectly sufficient for a guy our size. People are quick to forget that Trenbolone is a drug made for cattle. It's not made for humans. If you go look at the efficacious dosage for a cow and compare it to how much a human is using to step on stage, it really highlights how absurd some of these broscience dosages are that are pulled out of thin air. 300 mg is not obscenely high in a traditional bodybuilding context relative to what most guys are using I suppose, but it's still high. I'd probably do something more along the lines of this:  Testosterone Propionate – 150 mg per week Trenbolone Acetate – 150 mg per week Masteron Propionate – 300 mg per week Clenbuterol – 80 mcg per day (after titrating up slowly over the contest prep) T3 – 50 mcg (after titrating up from 25 mcg)  Bodybuilders' Purpose For Taking Steroids Cliche “Sometimes it's really freaking painful because you hit a nerve and you feel like you just got a butter knife and you stabbed it into yourself. You essentially feel like you're self-harming.” “I hope that if anything, you can be convinced by this video to stay natural and to not do these things to your body because this isn't me giving you the knowledge to go do it. This is me telling you to not do it because it is not f*cking worth it.” That's such a common cliche answer for guys on gear. I'm pretty sure you'd be doing it regardless. Let's be honest, there's a reason why I blasted AAS back in the day even when I wasn't trying to become a Mr. Olympia. We both know that your genetics aren't going to get you to the Olympia. Let's not pretend that you're doing this for competing purposes only. It's totally fine if you want to get a better physique and get past your genetic potential. A lot of guys try to justify their use of gear by talking about how it's only for competing and not for vanity. I think 99% of bodybuilders would be doing it for vanity purposes and just don't admit it, so they use competitions as a cover-up. A lot of these guys aren't getting to the Olympia stage and they know it. Their genetics just aren't good enough, so they're blasting gear unnecessarily by their logic if its solely for competing purposes. Most of those guys would probably be doing it anyway, regardless if they were competing or not. Remember, you'll know after your first cycle if you have Mr Olympia genetics. These guys are aware they're not going anywhere, but blast copious amounts of androgens regardless just to compete at low level shows. Which is fine, I'm all for using PED's even if you aren't a high level competitor if you want to improve your quality of life, physique, or performance, but don't use a cop out like Brandon.  Brandon Harding's Steroid Cycle Is Overkill I think the orals are over the top, unnecessary, and I'd probably not use any of them at his size personally. I'd prefer higher Masteron in place of those orals. Masteron is the most effective DHT derivative you can use for drying out, so I would just prefer a higher dosage of that instead of using 3 orals that will destroy your lipids, cause unnecessary organ stress, and are just not as efficacious anyways for the purpose they are intended. Trenbolone at 300 mg per week I'd probably be a bit wary of, especially at my size or this guy's size. I don't think we need dosages exceeding what they use for cows. I also question the AI usage and the excessive T3.

    "content": "Why Kinobody’s Natty Verified Challenge Will Not Work     Kinobody's Natty Verified Movement There's a lot of buzz on Gregory O'Gallagher, or Kinobody's Natty Verified Challenge, where he's basically going to grant official “Natty Verified” status to those who pass a carbon isotope ratio test to detect exogenous androgens in their system. This test is of the highest standard of testing for exogenous versus endogenous androgens, and ratios of hormones, as well as a variety of really sensitive details that would be able to detect naturals versus non-naturals. First of all, the very obvious limitation is the fact that you can only detect the use of up to X amount of months, or X amount of years, depending on what you're testing for. Even if you have somebody who took steroids 20 years ago, that person is still not natural and has a performance enhancing advantage relative to somebody who's never taken anything in their life, despite being able to pass a carbon isotope ratio test.  Retaining Muscle Myonuclei After Steroid Use For a long time we've understood the premise behind muscle memory and retaining muscle myonuclei after a break from training [R]. If you stop working out, getting back to where you were is easier than it was to gain that muscle initially in the first place. I'm sure you've experienced this. You take a bit of time off, you hop back on a strict regimen, and boom, you get everything back very quickly. This is muscle memory. We've understood for a long time this premise, but we didn't know how far it extended. There's a new data released in a study published in January 2019 that suggests that a muscle can gain myonuclei and never loses it, ever, for the entirety of your life.   The new data states, “The discovery that myonuclei are retained indefinitely emphasizes the importance of exercise in early life during adolescence. Muscle growth is enhanced by hormones, nutrition, and a robust pool of stem cells, making it an ideal period for individuals to bank myonuclei that can be drawn upon to remain active in old age.” Essentially, what it means is that if you take advantage of high endogenous androgen levels in your youth you can create a bank of myonuclei that you can then draw off of later in life; when gaining muscle would be harder than it would be otherwise when you were 21 years old and had peaking natural testosterone levels. The same principle extends to exogenous steroid/androgen use, as a user could create a bank of myonuclei that would otherwise be impossible to produce naturally, and then reap performance enhancing benefits from that myonuclei bank throughout their life, even years after they've discontinued performance enhancing drug use. Fake Nattys Vs Real Nattys What does this mean for an enhanced athlete though? If you take steroids in the past, you can retain that increase in myonuclei in the muscle for life, even if you come off of steroids. Even if you took something 20 years ago, remnant performance enhancing effects of that cycle likely still remain in the muscle fibers themselves to some degree. As a result, even if you pass a carbon isotope ratio test 20 years later, if you took a cycle when you were 19 years old, that cycle still has some level of performance-enhancing benefit in your current natural physique, whether you want to believe it or not. Somebody like Julian Smith, who claims he only took a prohormone cycle when he was younger, is not a natural, even if he passes a carbon isotope ratio test. https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxpxfs3HZdU/ It doesn't exempt him from the fact that he took a cycle when he was younger, that's going to impact his performance and his overall musculature at his current age. Regardless, if he's walking around with only endogenous androgens in his body currently, it doesn't matter because he took something when he was younger, which very likely has some degree of long-term performance-enhancing benefits. Androgen use creates a bank of myonuclei that your body can draw upon and gain an advantage over somebody else who was never in a state of supraphysiological androgens, regardless of how long ago it was. While I do believe the movement itself is a positive one, it creates a situation where you can have guys who further solidify their Natty status to uneducated and inept young kids who don't understand the science behind this stuff, and can irresponsibly grant certain guys a Natty Verified badge when they are in fact not Natty. They are still gaining some sort of performance-enhancing benefit from something they're currently using, used a few months ago, or used 20 years ago. It doesn't really matter. A lot of these guys touched something at one point or another. Even when I was in high school, it was incredibly common for guys my age to accidentally take Steroids. You could literally go get M1T's, Dymethazine and Superdrol from your local supplement store when prohormones were legal and over the counter, because everyone thought they were just supplements. Realistically, most people in the fitness industry have taken something at one point or another. Passing a carbon isotope ratio test, while it may confirm that you're natural at the moment, it doesn't disqualify the years prior that you could have taken something that's now out of your system, or the bank of myonuclei you built up in your past via however many years of exogenous hormone use. The Natty Verified Movement Could Make Things Even Worse    Again, I do think the whole movement is positive. I just think it could create a negative outcome after everything is said and done. Because you're going to have a few guys who'll slip through the cracks who gets this “Natty status.” They actually have unrealistic physiques that can't be achieved, and the carbon isotope ratio test isn't going to be able to pick it up. Keep that in mind, take everything with a grain of salt. I'm not sure if the guys running Kinobody's Natty Verified movement are taking that into account. Hopefully, they are, and they have some sort of loophole in place for that. I don't think guys who have taken steroids in the past should be allowed to compete or be tested in this Natty Verified movement. Like Julian Smith, for example. Not to put him on blast, but he's very open about how he's taken something when he was younger, regardless if he is on something now or not. The point is, he said he's done something and he's going to be doing this Natty Verified challenge. Even if he passes the test and gets this badge of honor saying he's a “Natty,” he's actually not. This fact doesn't disqualify the fact that you took something when you were younger and you have this Myonuclei bank build up that no one else could have built via exogenous prohormone use.

    "content": "Why More Body Hair Growth Means More Hair Loss On Your Head     More Body Hair Growth Equates To More Hair Loss There's a huge misconception about how androgens affect hair growth. A lot of guys truly believe that androgenic hormones improve scalp hair growth because “more body hair growth” is a listed side effect. I've literally heard guys say “I grow more facial hair and body hair on steroids, therefore, it also improves hair growth on your head.” You need to understand that the more androgens in your system, for 99% of people, will equate to more body hair growth, facial hair growth, everywhere hair growth, EXCEPT for the hair on top of your head. It's the most brutal trade-off of genetics ever. When it comes to male hormones and androgens, even if androgens promote body hair growth, the more body hair growth you experience will in almost all cases also mean more hair loss on your head in parallel. They're literally inversely related, despite them both being hair.  That's why if a woman takes steroids she may start developing masculine features, a deeper voice, and even grow facial hair and more body hair if they push their androgen index up high enough. These are just some of the side effects among a myriad of other masculine traits that develop in the presence of exogenous androgens. If you're a human, you can't just haphazardly use performance-enhancing androgens and assume that you're going to be hair loss free, because that's not how it works in almost all cases unless you are a genetic elite who is immune to androgenic alopecia (90-99% aren't). Ultimately, the more androgens in your system, the greater your likelihood to lose more hair on your head. Straight up, that's just how androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness) works. Even disregarding exogenous hormones entirely, 9/10 men will experience very noticeable diffuse thinning and recession in their lifetime just as a result of their natural endogenous hormone production. That's the reason why we have facial hair and body hair to begin with too. How Castration Prevents Male Pattern Baldness The Castrati were men castrated before hitting puberty. They were castrated to preserve their angelic high pitched singing voices.  I personally speculate that Michael Jackson was castrated as a child as well for this exact same reason. The Castrati had a notable lack of body hair, as well as a scalp free of miniaturization.  The reason for this is that the Castrati never produced significant amounts of androgens. They did produce very small amounts of Testosterone, and consequently DHT as a result of production in the adrenal glands, but it wasn't in significant enough quantities to facilitate normal development during puberty, or androgenic alopecia. Therefore, they didn't undergo any visible hair follicle miniaturization, and their bodies were essentially hair-free. Notable is the fact that this isn't the case with those who were castrated after puberty and had already begun experiencing more body hair growth. Those individuals would experience a significant reduction in body hair growth after castration, but never stopped growing body hair entirely. This is why men who transition genders to female typically require laser hair removal if they wish to be body hair free. This suggests that androgens on some level can have irreversible effects on hair follicles to some extent. While this isn't significant enough to prevent a severely balding male from regrowing his hair almost entirely via pharmacology and hormone manipulation, the data still suggests some level of irreversibility. Funny enough, Varys the eunuch from Game Of Thrones is bald throughout the entire series. (If you've watched the show you will know that he shaves his head bald on purpose to prevent people from identifying him as a Targaryen, as their hair color is a clear distinguishing marker). You need to realize it's an inverse relationship. If you're going to be using supraphysiological amounts of androgens, or even simply walk around with your normal endogenous androgen production and you care about the hair on your head, then you should establish a hair loss prevention regimen that addresses and protects you from both testosterone and DHT. I assure you, more body hair growth does not mean you will also grow more hair on your head.

    "content": "Do You Need To Be Sore After Working Out To Gain Muscle?     How Sore You Were When You First Started Working Out Vs Now When you first start working out as a newbie you'll notice after 24 to 48 hours you are absurdly sore. When a new type of stimulus/resistance is exerted upon your body you will inevitably experience “delayed onset muscle soreness” (DOMS), which is completely normal and expected. You'll notice as you become more and more advanced, you start to become less and less sore. Then the question arises, “is what I'm doing effective for muscle growth if I'm no longer sore?” The short answer is … No, you don't need to be sore after working out to gain muscle.  If you just trained your legs and your legs aren't super sore, does that mean that you're not training them adequately enough? I don't think so, especially if you're getting enough macronutrients, you're hitting your daily calorie allotment and sleeping enough (all things that will shorten your needed recovery time). For bodybuilders who are enhanced, you'll also notice you have a much lower propensity to soreness. Even when you do get sore, you recover a lot quicker, and at the end of the day it's not going to hinder your growth if you're not feeling sore. Training like a lazy f*ck will prevent you from gaining muscle yes, but if you're training hard and intelligently and still aren't getting sore, don't sweat it. Don't train yourself into the ground or do something stupid like go to the gym again later that day because you aren't sore. Some guys will wake up the day after chest day and if their chest isn't sore they will literally go back to the gym and hit the same chest exercises again. Insanity. Do not think that the absence of muscle soreness is an indication of an inadequate workout. Signs Of A Good Workout  Again, you don't need to be sore after working out to gain muscle. As long as you're stretching and contracting the muscle properly, incorporating progressive overload, and hitting muscle failure on at least your last set of each exercise, you'll grow (if you're eating enough and don't have a hormone deficiency). I'm very rarely sore myself with the exception of leg day. That doesn't mean that my legs are going to grow better than my other body parts though. Don't burn out your central nervous system trying to hit the same body part three days in a row because you're not getting sore from it. Train properly, hit your macros, get enough sleep, and you'll be good to go regardless if you're sore or not.

Melanotan II Results Can Be Permanent Whether or not Melanotan II permanently tans your skin is something that isn't discussed often in relation to its use. I felt the need to address this because I'm a very experienced Melanotan II user and have researched it a lot over the years. Yes, to some extent, Melanotan II permanently darkened my skin after a year of continuous use.  Melanotan II is an injectable peptide mainly used to greatly increase your body’s ability to tan. The pigment of your skin getting darker is the result of UV ray exposure. As your skin becomes exposed to UV rays, Melanin is produced to protect your skin from burning and sun damage. If you're using Melanotan II for a short sporadic period of time, I'm not 100% sure if it's going to be permanent, or the results may just be negligible due to low frequency or dosage in general. But, if you've got yourself to a pretty dark shade, there is absolutely a possibility that your base color will permanently become darker than your original skin color, even if you've discontinued Melanotan II usage and stopped getting UV exposure. My Baseline Skin Tone Now Vs. Before In the training footage below, this is after the entire winter of not touching Melanotan II, or being in the sun at all.  You can see I still have a tan, and I still am the same color now. I look decently tanned considering I have been indoors and haven't stepped in the sun for a third of a year, and I haven't touched Melanotan II either. If you look at my base color of what I used to be before I tried Melanotan II a couple of years ago, it was this:  I was a very pale person. To this day now, no matter how long I take off of Melanotan II, or don't go in the sun, Melanotan II permanently darkened my skin, as my base color never really gets lighter than that video. Keep that in mind if you are going to embark on any experiments using Melanotan II. Melanotan II permanently darkens your skin color, and the tan it produces lasts for a significantly longer period of time than a naturally achieved tan. Take Martina Big for example. She has abused Melanotan II for so long and with such high dosages that even if she stopped using it and stopped UV exposure entirely, it would probably take upwards of a year for her to revert back to baseline, and her baseline is almost undoubtedly darker than her original base skin tone. Take this into consideration when it comes to long term Melanotan II usage. Where To Buy Melanotan II Online Fortunately, Melanotan II isn't faked very often, and it's pretty easy to tell if the quality is on point or not very quickly. This is my go to company right now: High Purity Melanotan II You can get Bacteriostatic Water at a local pharmacy, as well as insulin syringes.

    "content": "Natural Bodybuilding Vs. Enhanced Bodybuilding While Cutting | TRT Is NOT The Equivalent Of A Natural     Natural bodybuilding vs. enhanced bodybuilding while cutting yield significantly different outcomes.  Even just TRT is not the equivalent of being a natural, even if your Testosterone levels are in the therapeutic “natural” range. I saw a bodybuilder who posted his bloodwork while he was preparing for a competition, and it was super insightful into the effects intense dieting has on the body because he's a natural athlete. His blood work showed the massive impact a steep calorie deficit and restricting yourself for months on end will actually have on your Testosterone levels.  Natural Testosterone Level Your natural Testosterone level could be anywhere between 250 to 1000 ng/dL, depending on the reference range. The reference range in this specific individuals' blood work was 250 to 1100 ng/dL. His blood work was tested at Quest Diagnostics, which is a really well-known and reputable testing facility. He went out of his way to just show everyone what his blood work was so we could see exactly what it actually takes to get shredded for a competition as a natural athlete, and the impact it has on your hormonal profile. If you're hypogonadal, or you just take TRT for other reasons, you're probably using it to stay on the high end of the natural reference range of 250 to 1100 ng/dL. Most guys will say being on TRT is the equivalent of being natural, and that they just have to use the TRT to achieve that because they can't endogenously produce it otherwise. Maybe while you're bulking, this might be the case occasionally. But when you're cutting, there's undoubtedly a massive performance enhancing advantage that is often not taken into account. Natural Bodybuilding Vs. Enhanced Bodybuilding While Cutting Hormone Levels Let's just say your TRT puts you at 900 ng/dL and you have a natural who happens to be genetically gifted and is also at 900 ng/dL. Now, let's take those same two individuals and put them in a steep calorie deficit with cardio and restrict the amount of food they need to sustain their body weight. You're basically putting them in a state of energy restriction where their body is not getting what it needs to sustain itself. Then, they're both in a calorie deficit for prolonged periods of time to achieve competition stage ready body fat percentage. As a result of this, the natural's testosterone levels will plummet, whereas the guy on TRT stays at 900 ng/dL the entirety of his cut. So, let's take this natural, Chris Elkins, as a perfect example.  Chris posted his bloodwork, and you can see here 250 to 1100 is the reference range. His total testosterone was 43 ng/dL. That's literally the equivalent of a girl. His free testosterone is also far below the reference range. Bioavailable, free, usable testosterone is the number we actually care about, but both of these are severely low regardless. He's literally walking around with testosterone levels equivalent to a female while trying to prepare for a male bodybuilding competition.                View this post on Instagram                      THE CONSEQUENCES OF ELITE CONDITIONING IN NATURAL BODYBUILDING . . I went to a local Wellness Mart and got a male hormone panel on Wednesday, the 3rd day of depletion before WNBF Worlds. I was at my most depleted, lightest and felt the worst I’ve felt so far in prep. I was very curious to know what my testosterone levels were at this point in prep as I was suffering and knew it was low but had no idea how low it was. . . You’ll have to zoom in to see the results. My total testosterone was at 43. Normal levels are from 250 to 1100 with the average being somewhere around 600 for my age. I have never in my life seen anyone else with 43. Unfortunately, as you get to essential levels of body fat your body shuts down or reduces production of testosterone because reproduction is no longer a necessity in a period of what equates to controlled starvation. Sex drive becomes non existent, energy levels tank, and it’s common to have mood swings. I could feel this happening in my body as I got leaner. As a natural athlete we’re not supplementing or injecting any exogenous hormones so this is something that happens with most natural athletes that push their body to the limit and why I also warn people about dieting to this level if they aren’t competing or even worse, trying to maintain this body fat. . . The good news is that I’m up 10 lbs from my lowest weight and I’m feeling much better. Mood and energy are ten times better. Libido is coming back. I plan to get tested again in a couple of months once I’m more recovered. In the past I’ve always bounced back pretty quickly so let’s hope that’s the case this time. . . Some interesting questions are; if the length of the diet played a role in this. I wasn’t overly aggressive until the very end yet still ended up here. How much did the depletion play a role in these numbers? How much would my levels increase if i was maintaining this body fat on maintenance calories? I also wonder what my levels were around 6 lbs over stage weight and when they really started to tank. I felt fairly good at 145 to 150 lbs (137.6 was my absolute lowest). . . Tag anyone that might find this relevant. A post shared by  Chris Elkins ? (@chris_elkins) on Nov 21, 2018 at 9:19am PST   \n\n Then, let's take the guy on TRT, who claims that what he's doing is the equivalent to being natural. We put them on the exact same diet, calorie restriction, intense level of cardio to get down to that body fat percentage. His testosterone level by the end of it are still going to be 900 ng/dL versus the natural guys' 43 ng/dL. Who do you think is going to sustain their lean tissue in the cut? Is it going to be the guy who's walking around with testosterone levels equivalent to a girl, or the guy who has the exact same level of hormone optimization throughout the entirety of his cut? You can start to see very quickly how there's a big misconception between what is really natural and what's not. There's no way you could maintain a 900 to 1000 ng/dL testosterone level and be natural in a steep deficit trying to get to 5% body fat, it's just not possible. There's obviously a performance enhancing advantage to TRT, even though it's just natural levels on paper. I just wanted to put this misconception to rest. This is a perfect example of somebody who cut down to to stage-ready body fat levels completely naturally, and what the process did to his hormone profile. Natural bodybuilding vs. enhanced bodybuilding while cutting on TRT is not equivalent to one another, and that's just a fact.

    "content": "How Long Do Kits Of GH And Peptides Last Before Degrading?     Shelf Life Of GH And Peptides There are a lot of strong opinions about how long kits of GH and peptides last before degrading in room temperature, versus in a fridge, versus in the freezer. Most people are getting these products through black market means. The transition of GH and peptides from origin to seller, to likely a middleman, to you, can be months. There's so much ship time that these compounds aren't being refrigerated for, and 99% of the time they're not shipped with ice packs or anything to keep them cold. Yet, nobody complains about degradation upon receiving their products.  The funny thing is how many guys freak out that it needs to be thrown in the fridge right away, or the 10 minutes it took for them to drive from the post office to put it in their fridge. When in reality, it has been sitting out of the fridge for months already. The stability of these products is a lot longer than you probably think. Some even believe that if you left a peptide out of the fridge overnight it is probably bunk and might as well be trashed. That's not the case guys. How Long Will GH And Peptides Last Out Of The Fridge? GH and peptides last for months without significant degradation in room temperature out of direct sunlight if they have not been reconstituted. Reconstituted GH and peptides last for weeks, if not months still, in room temperature out of direct sunlight. The fragility of the peptide in question will cause variation in this figure, however, in general, it is much longer than most believe. Just to give you a real-life example, my friend had a mixed vial of Melanotan II sitting in his girlfriend's purse for half a year. He went through the entire summer with this reconstituted vial of Melanotan sitting in her purse, and even went on vacation at one point. It had been through a substantial amount of shaking and high temperatures, which are both complete no-no's when it comes to peptide storage. Most would assume that it would be completely degraded and bunk by that point. He tried it, and there was literally no difference in potency from the day he got it. Even I was surprised. Now, this isn't indicative of every peptide. Some are more sensitive than others, like IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1) and GH for example, which are far more sensitive than Melanotan II in my opinion. Standard Storage Procedures To Maximize Shelf-Life If you want to store unmixed peptides long-term, put them in the freezer. If your GH or peptides have been reconstituted, store them in the fridge. These standards will extend the shelf life of these products for maximum duration. If you accidentally left your kit out overnight or it was in your car overnight, don't freak out and trash your product. These compounds are a lot more stable than we've been led to believe on the forums. Obviously, I would advise using proper storage procedures to maximize the lifespan of these products. At the end of the day, if you screw up by accident, your stuff is probably fine, and will likely have barely degraded, if at all.

    "content": "The First Product You Should Use For Hair Loss Prevention     What's the first product you should use for hair loss prevention? Obviously, there are a lot of drugs and chemicals on the market when it comes to hair loss prevention. There's a lot of junk, there's some stuff that works, but they vary greatly in side effect profiles, and some make much more logical sense to use as introductory methods of intervention.  Get A Hair Catcher First things first, I already mentioned this another article, but getting a hair catcher is the first thing you should do.  Obviously, this is the only way you're going to accurately gauge if things are working or not treatment-wise. This tool assesses your progress and it projects how your hair is going to respond to new interventions and treatments. If you're shedding 200 hairs per shower, and then you start a hair loss prevention regimen and it drops to five hairs per shower, you can roughly project if you will experience an increase in density over the course of the next couple months, assuming that shedding amount stays consistent. This is the first tool you should get, but I consider this a tool for progression measurement. Now let's get into the first actual treatment you can use. Get A Ketoconazole Shampoo In my opinion, the first product you should use for hair loss prevention is a Ketoconazole shampoo. There is debate whether this is an effective anti-androgen at the hair follicles, or if it even does anything to begin with. Based on the clinical data, I believe there is more than enough evidence to justify its use. Especially when you consider the side effect profile relative to other efficacious alternatives. There are a lot of anecdotal logs to support that it is beneficial and has anti-androgenic properties on the scalp as well. Ketoconazole shampoo is the only product that's over the counter and is what I would consider very low risk. Technically, Minoxidil is over the counter too, but, in my opinion, Minxodil is actually one of the most side effect ridden hair loss prevention treatments. I honestly wouldn't even add that in until way down the line. Ketoconazole shampoo is low risk, it's over the counter and it's not illegal to get without a prescription. And for some guys, it's sufficient enough to halt shedding. Keep in mind, it will very likely not be sufficient as a form of monotherapy if you have even mildly aggressive hair loss. However, if you're just starting to worry about hair loss, or are just a guy who cares about their hair in general, sometimes this can be enough to halt shedding and it is a great introduction to hair loss prevention. Use The Least Amount Of Drugs Possible You don't want to go gung ho into Ketoconazole, RU58841, Dutasteride, Minoxidil, and other experimental compounds immediately if you don't have aggressive hair loss. Use the least intense regimen you can get away with, and scale up as needed. You will have other stronger (and more side-effect ridden) compounds in your arsenal later down the line should you end up needing them. If you don't have aggressive hair loss, get a Ketoconazole shampoo and see how that affects your shedding amounts. Get a baseline hair count with a hair catcher to see what the average amount of hairs you lose per shower is. Once you have that baseline established, you can start adding things into your hair loss prevention protocol and assess if your shedding amounts are decreasing. If you can get things under control with a good Ketoconazole shampoo, then you are lucky. If not, you'll probably need something more intense like an actual 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, or a topical anti-androgen. But, if you can get away with just a run-of-the-mill shampoo, then why would you exert more stuff upon your body? If I could just use an over the counter shampoo and have zero shedding, that's all I'd use. But I can't, so that's why I use an array of other treatments in conjunction with Ketoconazole. Your situation may differ though because everyone has their own individual genetic propensity, hormone profile, amount of hairs to work with, and a variety of other individual specific factors. 1% Ketoconazole Vs 2% Ketoconazole If you live in the US, I believe 2% Ketoconazole is prescription only. Interestingly enough, you can't buy 5% strength Minoxidil over the counter in Canada, you can only find 2% strength. In the US, you can find 5% Minoxidil super easily. In Canada, we have 2% Ketoconazole (Nizoral) over the counter though. You can buy Nizoral 2% in Costco over the counter here in Canada, but in the US 2% strength is prescription only.  Fortunately for you if you live in the US, there doesn't seem to be a significant difference in efficacy between 1% and 2% strength Ketoconazole shampoos. I've used both the 2% and 1% for years and I don't notice a difference between them. The Intelligent Ketoconazole shampoo makes my hair look better anyways so I almost always opt for it over my 2% Nizoral shampoo. If you haven't already, go buy a hair catcher and a Ketoconazole shampoo. It's definitely the first product you should use for hair loss prevention. If the shampoo doesn't work, you will likely need RU58841 or CB-03-01, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, Minoxidil, and/or other more intense experimental treatment alternatives. But if you don't need any of those though and can just get away with a shampoo, then that's a huge win for you, and you are among the genetically blessed.

It acts as an androgen receptor antagonist and is being developed by Cassiopea as a potential treatment of androgen-dependent conditions including acne vulgaris and androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness). The tentative brand name for the preparation of CB-03-01 intended for androgenic alopecia is “Breezula”.  This topical antiandrogen has a lot of hype in the hair loss community becuase of its recent clinical trial results.  So, as far as CB-03-01, and my thoughts. First of all, I see the cost-effectiveness of it relative to the next best alternative as a huge limiting factor right now. Even if you bought it now, it's much more expensive than other commonly used topical antiandrogens. And as far as its efficacy, I have yet to see it outperform anything else in the topical antiandrogen category. Clinical data shows it's somewhere in the ballpark of Finasteride's efficacy. But as you probably already know, Finasteride is just a band-aid at the end of the day.  It might sustain you for 10, 20, or even 30 years if you're lucky, but eventually, you're going to start losing your hair again, as that's just what happens when you don't take care of testosterone as well. However, in the case of CB-03-01, because it is an antiandrogen that binds to the androgen receptor and prevents testosterone and DHT from inducing their harmful miniaturizing effects, in theory, this would in the long-term likely outperform standard 5-alpha reductase inhibitors that do not protect you from testosterone. CB-03-01 Vs RU58841 And Other Topical AntiAndrogens Comparing CB-03-01 to RU58841 and the other next best alternatives has not been promising.  Granted, RU58841 is still hit or miss for many people as well as a standalone treatment, as are all other topical antiandrogens as of now. With that being said, I have yet to hear of anybody having significantly better results from CB-03-01 than RU58841 or any other topical antiandrogen, and it might even be worse according to some people. Milligram for milligram CB-03-01 doesn't seem to be any better than the alternatives that are already being used in the community as is. Its topical potency was determined to be greater than that of progesterone, flutamide, and finasteride, but was roughly equivalent to that of Cyproterone acetate CB-03-01 Vs. Cyproterone Vs 17α-Estradiol   RU58841 exhibited a 20% increase in androgen receptor binding when compared to Cyproterone. By extension, this implies that RU58841 is more potent than CB-03-01, and it seems to hold up in practical application anecdotally in the hair loss prevention community. I haven't used CB-03-01 personally, but it's on my list of compounds to delve deeper into. Based on what I've heard from guys I know, I do not have high hopes for it though. There are undoubtedly some promising attributes that we should look at seriously though. *Update* I have now tried CB-03-01 and can compare it directly to other treatment options. The First FDA Approved Topical AntiAndrogen For Androgenic Alopecia CB-03-01 is in a pipeline right now to become FDA approved as the first topical antiandrogen for hair loss prevention.  Its safety profile is the main thing that should be taken into account in contrast to something like RU58841. In a clinical setting, there's more safety data on CB-03-01. It's not some experimental compound from 20 years ago that only had a few trials on it. It's literally almost approved right now for androgenic alopecia and acne treatment. Interestingly, RU was being evaluated as an acne treatment as well. Obviously there's some correlation there between acne, androgenic alopecia, and androgen receptor activation. The question arises as to why CB-03-01 is being approved and not other topical antiandrogens like RU58841. I assume that it has a lot of it has to do with the business side of the pharmaceutical industry, as opposed to the overall efficacy of the product. In the case of RU58841, a company called Proskelia Pharmaceuticals (a part of ProStrakan Pharmaceuticals) completed clinical trials and purportedly found no red flags. Once it came time to seek investors to get RU58841 closer to FDA approval there was a company merger and that side of the business was closed. CB-03-01 Side Effects CB-03-01 supposedly has a lower incidence of side effects, meaning you could use more of it to achieve the same results you would of a lower dosed, more side-effect ridden antiandrogen, in theory. Or potentially even use more of it to achieve greater results than an antiandrogen that outperforms it milligram for milligram, but is more side-effect ridden. From what I've seen, the side effects are the same as you would expect from any antiandrogen that goes systemic. Obviously the incidence of side effects is going to be largely individual dependent based on scalp porosity, application technique, scalp sebum levels, and a variety of other factors that will greatly impact how this compound is going to work (or not work) on your head. If CB-03-01 does get FDA approval, the potential issue I see is that even if it gets approved in the next two to three years (which is probably conservative), the price of it for the dose you're going to get is very likely not going to be acceptable. And when you go into the underground space to try and get it, the price point is several times higher than the alternatives. So, when it comes to cost, it doesn't seem to be an improvement from our current options, at least right now. That remains to be seen in the future. Anecdotally, CB-03-01 monotherapy has already shown to work for some men with less aggressive male pattern baldness, but it is not side-effect free. Unfortunately, topical antiandrogens all still have their deficiencies in terms of overall efficacy for the general population. There's also going to be people which it doesn't work for, but that's just what happens with every drug to be honest. There's also going to be people who will experience side effects and people who don't experience side effects, this is a given. I think it's going to be a good tool, as are other some of the other notable topical antiandrogens, but it isn't the beacon of hope hair loss sufferers are hoping it is. Can CB-03-01's Application Cause Difficulties? Unfortunately when it comes to topicals, there are a lot of factors that can cause vast variations in the sufficient delivery of a compound. Any idiot can pop a pill, but not every single person is going to apply a topical antiandrogen properly. Ensuring the scalp is clean, there's no sebum inhibiting absorption, there's no hair sucking up excessive amounts of the solution, the solution is being applied correctly, not even accounting for the likely possibility that the thickness of the scalp of a balding person compared to a non-balding person is quite a bit different, there are so many variables that will greatly impact if CB-03-01 (or any other topical) works or not. This isn't even accounting for the fact that different men will require different dosages and volumes of solution. You're going to be limited by your doctor and whatever they think you need. I would be surprised if they prescribed a CB-03-01 dosage high enough for a diffuse thinner to apply it all over his head. 1 mg of Finasteride is 1 mg of Finasteride, no matter who takes it. But with CB-03-01 and other topical antiandrogens, the amount of solution being applied to someone who has mild recession and just uses it on small portions of their head relative to someone who is diffuse thinning and needs to apply it all over the top of their head will be hugely different overall dosages. I see it as a good thing that there's a topical antiandrogen in the pipeline that's almost FDA approved, but I'm not super excited about it. At the end of the day, despite the fact that I anticipate that it will be hit or miss as a form of monotherapy, it is certainly still a big step forward in the industry. Where To Buy CB-03-01 Most CB-03-01 sources do not third party test their products, nor do they have any satisfactory level of quality control whatsoever. I strongly advise that before you buy CB-03-01 from a company online you thoroughly evaluate their track record, their third party test results, and how they are marketing their products in general.

    "date": "2019-05-11T00:39:56+00:00",
    "content": "Why You Shouldn’t Take Advice From Bodybuilders With Great Genetics     There are an increasing amount of bodybuilders with great genetics who are now coaches. They are often referred to as gurus, and some were even legendary bodybuilders themselves. A handful were even Mr. Olympia contenders, or champions themselves. But should we take bodybuilding advice from them? These are the reasons why you shouldn't take advice from bodybuilders with great genetics.  Coaches With Phenomenal Genetics Gurus and coaches who are former (or current) professional bodybuilders with great genetics are hyper-responders to anabolics, and bodybuilding in general. Believe it or not, these guys actually don't know what they're talking about most of the time. First of all, I have no biases here. I have no motivation financially to try and convince you guys to use my services, because I don't do coaching. I don't have the time, nor do I really want to, to be honest. I'm just telling you what I would do if I was just starting out seriously in bodybuilding, and what I would avoid. Based on my experience, I've noticed that a lot of former elite bodybuilders with great genetics have started to throw their hats into the coaching scene to make money after their retirement from the stage. Once they retire, they have to find means of making money. For a lot of those guys, their means of making money is coaching. This is fine for some guys, but the problem with this is when you have guys who are hyper-responders trying to coach average joes. The elite hyper-responder bodybuilders are so used to having a coach themselves telling them what to do, that they never had to get deep into research to figure out how to maximize their physique because they just responded perfectly to everything. A relevant example are guys with hair loss prevention advice. Do you have any guys who know a lot about preventing hair loss that aren't experiencing hair loss? Typically, no. Because they have no reason to do research in the first place because it's not a practical use of their time in real life, and they already have that issue resolved. Gurus Who Don't Know What They're Talking About If you go listen to elite bodybuilders in the 90s talk about their performance enhancing drug cycles, you'll quickly start to notice how little these guys actually knew about the drugs they were putting in their bodies relative to what you would expect. Tom Platz did a video where he actually interviewed a bunch of top bodybuilders in the 90s. It featured bodybuilders with great genetics at the Olympia level, and it was anonymous, even though you can tell who they were based on their voices, and you can see through the pixelations. These guys were talking openly about what they take, and half of them didn't even seem to know what they were talking about when it comes to anabolics, pharmacology, and bodybuilding, in general.    If you understand bodybuilding pharmacology, it makes you really question, “Can I really take advice from bodybuilders with great genetics?” Back then, there was no internet that you could just reference for this stuff, so a lot of these guys just relied on their genetics. It worked for them because they didn't need that top 0.01% of knowledge, and they still did amazing and looked great. Now, these retired bodybuilders are coaches trying to apply their knowledge in a hyper-response capacity, where they knew only very rudimentary concepts and still looked good, to guys who have average or subpar genetics, and expect the same result, and it just never translates. For example, I've heard guys who are current coaches, telling guys to use Arimidex and Letrozole in their peak week to dry out. These are two completely identical drugs in their mechanism of action. If you have crashed you're E2 to zero, does adding Letro in really contribute to anything? No, you're just hindering the guys' health for no reason. You have these guys who are highly-acclaimed IFBB pros giving out protocols that just make absolutely no sense. To me, the way they go about giving protocols out is the equivalent of them taking whatever they randomly took when they were IFBB pros, which for them still equated to amazing results because they never had to research how stuff really works. Here's another example. Kevin Levrone talking about his nationals diet in '91. Levrone talked about how he'd go to 7-Eleven and get hotdogs with fake cheese on it, or go to McDonald's and eat everything on the menu, but at the end of the day, still got shredded to the bone and won his pro card.  This is a diet model that nobody would succeed with except him. I'm not saying Kevin Levrone doesn't know what he's talking about. But would you really want to take advice from a guy who could do that and never had to research into intricate blood-sugar management, how to go about using each drug correctly, why you shouldn't combine certain compounds with others, and all of the other elaborate concepts that come into contest preparation? Probably not. Kevin Levrone was such a hyper-responder, he could eat cake every day and still win shows. How To Choose The Best Bodybuilding Coach In bodybuilding, the coaches who know the most are actually typically the guys with horrible genetics that still developed good competitive physiques, or have done so with their clients consistently. Those are the guys you want to listen to. I know that sounds ridiculous. I used to think, “Why would somebody listen to a guy who's fat and looks terrible?” The reason is that these guys are typically the ones who actually have the incentive to learn, and are the individuals who went deep into research, and are more knowledgeable because they are the bodybuilders who couldn't develop insane physiques eating cake every day and popping random Winny tabs every few days.  Go find a coach who took somebody who has crappy genetics and made them a good bodybuilder, not a coach who took a great bodybuilder and made him a great bodybuilder because he hasn't actually done anything. These coaches who piggyback off the success of bodybuilders with great genetics can literally tell them to do anything and they will still hyper-respond. There are a handful of those good bodybuilding coaches out there. I don't want to name names, but just be wary about coaches handing out dangerous protocols. The funny thing is that a lot of these guys are critical of other guys' dangerous protocols, when they themselves don't even know what they're talking about. Steer away from the gurus who work only exclusively with genetic phenoms, or are genetic phenoms themselves. Those are the guys who also had coaches take them under their wing and never needed to do any research for themselves. They never went out of their way to look at clinical data, or research in general, because literally everything seemed to work for them. Work With Credible Coaches With A Track Record Hopefully, that helps you narrow down your search. I know, it's not extremely helpful that I don't have a list of coaches to refer to. But honestly, I don't keep up 100% with who's who in the community right now. I just see random videos popping up on YouTube, and once in a while I'll listen in on the conversations between bodybuilding gurus, and sometimes the stuff is just completely nonsensical. You should be wary of bodybuilding gurus who on the outside seem to know what they're talking about because their physiques are better than everyone else, and had great records in the IFBB to back them up. But in practical application, they typically have no idea how to work with guys who have bad genetics, unlike theirs, where they personally have low levels of Myostatin and hyper-respond to eating cheeseburgers all day. Again, don't take bodybuilding advice from bodybuilders with great genetics. Work with guys who have a tried-and-true record of bringing very average guys to a fairly high-level, that's my suggestion.

    "content": "Is A High Protein Diet Dangerous? – Study Shows That 1.5 Grams Of Protein Per Pound Of Body Weight Is Safe     There have been a few videos I've done in the past on protein intake and diet hacks that will make it a lot easier to hit your daily requirements. There's always the guys who pop in on there who try to argue that you don't need that much protein to recover properly, or that a high protein diet is dangerous.   These types of comments are typically misguided, as the research available isn't conducted on men who have enhanced physiques with supraphysiological abilities to utilize protein. When it comes to enhanced athletes, higher protein intakes can result in increased muscle growth outcomes, and there are studies that show there is absolutely no safety concern when it comes to consuming a high protein diet. Another misguided argument commonly made is that a high protein diet is dangerous. Is A High Protein Diet Dangerous? Myth Busted A lot of people truly believe that you're going to get kidney disease from having a high protein diet, and it's just unhealthy to have anything more than a gram per pound of body weight. I'm not saying you need to have more than a gram of protein per pound of bodyweight. Your individual goals, what drugs you're using, what drugs you're not using, will all influence what kind of macronutrient split you should have for your diet. Other factors include the type of training you do, if you train at all, your lifestyle, if you're sedentary, if you work a labor intensive job, and a variety of other individually dependent factors. One study in particular I found very interesting, as the study had trained athletes eating almost exactly 1.5 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight for a fairly long span of time. This study was published in 2016 and was called “A high protein diet has no harmful effects: one-year crossover study and resistance-trained males.” It specifically addressed the potential for high protein diets to be damaging to the kidneys.  In this study the subjects consumed 2.51-3.32 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. If you break the numbers down, that's up to 1.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight, which is an amount that a lot of guys would freak out about and say is excessive and dangerous. The study was for a one-year period on men who train, not rodents, not monkeys, or some other animal subject. Only resistance-trained males were used as subjects in this study. The overall impact on the renal system was nonexistent. Zero negative impact after having that much protein for a year straight, and it had no negative effects on lipid profiles. For the guys who want to reference clinical studies on protein, this is a perfect example of how consuming more than a gram of protein per pound of body weight is not going to hurt you, assuming you have healthy kidney function to begin with. Should You Have More Than A Gram Of Protein Per Pound Body Weight? I believe there are cases where preexisting impaired natural kidney function will make it more difficult and dangerous to consume a high protein diet. Slamming a bunch of protein with preexisting kidney issues will likely tax them further. However, if you're a perfectly healthy guy, you train hard, and you consume 1.25-1.5 grams of protein per day because you feel that's what you need to optimally recover, you're not going to hurt yourself, despite what many people claim. Conclusion Do I think everyone should have more than a gram of protein per pound body weight? No, I don't. But, if you're enhanced and you have a supraphysiological amount of hormones in your system and you want a steady inflow of protein throughout the day which you can utilize efficiently, by all means, I think you should probably have more than a gram of protein per pound bodyweight. I also don't think it's going to have a significantly negative effect on your health or longevity.

    "content": "How To Maintain Cardiovascular Health While Bodybuilding | Which Tests To Get And Health Supplements I Use     For most of us, preventing heart disease depends largely on our lifestyle, which means there's much that's in our power to maintain cardiovascular health while bodybuilding. Despite fit looking physiques being portrayed as examples of optimized health, the reality is that bodybuilding is one of the most unhealthy things you can do from a cardiac perspective. Therefore, I highly suggest you take extreme precautions to monitor your cardiovascular health while bodybuilding so you are fully aware of when your health markers become suboptimal, or even dangerous, and how to minimize the chances of that occurring. When it comes to bodybuilding, even if you take a bunch of performance enhancing drugs, if your blood pressure and your cardiovascular system is maintained, it's actually relatively difficult to really screw yourself up via other things.  Cardiovascular health is the main thing you need to worry about in bodybuilding. To be clear, I'm not saying that other things aren't important. I'm just saying that, in general, the thing that's going to get you in bodybuilding is heart disease. Steroids, HGH, eating a ton of food, increasing your body weight and having much more muscle than the average human are all things that will put a massive strain on your heart, consequently enlarging it and thickening its walls. Cardiovascular health is the main concern here. There are a handful of tests I believe are absolutely mandatory to maintain cardiovascular health while bodybuilding, and I highly recommend you get them all done fairly regularly.  Table of Contents ToggleBlood TestBlood PressureResting Heart Rate And TachycardiaWhich Lab Tests To Get?EKGEchocardiogramCardiac CT ScanTherapeutic Phlebotomy (If Needed)Get A Cardiologist Who Has Experience With BodybuildersGet Health InsuranceHealth Supplements I Use And RecommendCitrus BergamotPsyllium HuskCurcuminProbioticsOmega-3Ubiquinol (Not Coenzyme Q10)Hawthorn Berry ExtractMultivitaminVitamin K2Astragalus ExtractVitamin D-3Pomegranate Juice (100% Juice Not From Concentrate)CarditoneRelated Blood Test This is the most basic of health assessments. Unfortunately, most bodybuilders don't even get this done regularly. Blood work is an absolute no brainer and I highly recommend you get my recommended blood panel done via Private MD Labs at least a couple times per year. Ideally, you would get this more frequently, especially if you are cycling on and off of harmful performance enhancing drugs. You want to see what your state of health is like on-cycle, as well as off-cycle. The more you can see your blood work, the more of a complete picture of your state of health you will get on average throughout the year. Blood Pressure Blood pressure is extremely important. Weighing more than you should will already negatively influence your blood pressure, but adding heavily aromatizing drugs into the mix that cause severe water retention will commonly spike your blood pressure through the roof. When I was younger and didn't understand Estrogen management, I would literally get nose bleeds at work as a bouncer downtown just standing in one spot because my blood pressure was so high. You want your blood pressure to be no higher than 120/80 at all times, year-round. Anytime you're getting over 130-139/80-89, you're in stage one hypertension, and at that point, you're hurting your kidneys. That's how guys down the line end up with renal failure and are stuck on dialysis forever to survive.  Most bodybuilders will brush off blood pressure readings slightly above 120/80 that aren't considered hypertensive, when they shouldn't. Anything above 120/80 puts stress on your cardiovascular system, and will encourage clotting, heart attacks, and strokes. Check your blood pressure constantly, especially if you are on cycle and aren't sure if the compounds you are using are compatible with your body or not. Buy a high quality blood pressure monitor and check your blood pressure literally every day like you check your weight on the scale until you have a comprehensive understanding of what your blood pressure is like in response to your different lifestyle factors.  If the cuff is too small for your arm, buy a larger cuff to go with the monitor to ensure you get an accurate reading. The one I linked will fit your arm if it is between 9-17 inches in circumference unflexed. Resting Heart Rate And Tachycardia You also want to be checking your resting heart rate. A lot of guys are walking around with borderline tachycardia (resting heart rates over 100), which is super unhealthy. Many argue that heart rate is not important as long as you are under 100 beats per minute, but the reality is that the lower your resting heart rate is, the better indicator it is of your health.  Various studies have showed that higher resting heart rates equate to a higher risk of dying [R, R, R]. I don't think it's a coincidence that marathon runners, cyclists and people who have really great cardiovascular endurance have super low heart rates. For example, Lance Armstrong's resting heart rate was 32 beats per minute when he was in peak condition, which is insane.  The less hard your heart has to work to pump blood and oxygen around your body, the less stress is on it, and the longer you're going to be free of cardiovascular disease. Which Lab Tests To Get?  EKG As far as tests you want to get done, you definitely want to get EKG at least once a year if you're a young guy, and then if you're a bit older, maybe twice a year. An EKG records the electrical signals in your heart and is a great way to detect heart problems and arrhythmias. These were the results from my last EKG.  Echocardiogram I highly recommend you get an echocardiogram to check your cardiac output, assess any heart thickening and overall hypertrophy, as well as the size of your left ventricle. Even for guys who don't take steroids, if you lift weights, in general you're probably going to have some degree of left ventricular hypertrophy. And if it gets bad enough, you will be inhibiting the output of your heart. You need to keep an eye on that, you need to check for heart thickening and overall size. This is the number one test that is commonly overlooked by bodybuilders and would indicate progression towards heart failure. There are so many bodybuilders who are health conscious but are delusional by believing that blood work and donating blood will keep them healthy, despite walking around with 100 pounds more muscle than the average male. If these guys had echocardiograms done, they would have seen how much stress their heart was under well before it got bad enough that they had a major cardiac event. This is something that won't be detected by a blood test. You can have perfect blood work, blood pressure, donate blood often, but still have a heart twice as large as it should be and drop dead because you failed to get an echocardiogram. Cardiac CT Scan Cardiac CT scan is something I wouldn't hesitate to recommend either.  Get a scan of your heart arteries, check your blood flow to the heart, and ensure it's getting enough oxygen and overall blood flow. This scan assesses if you have any blockages in your vessels or not. You want to check for arrhythmias and blockages, as these are often manageable issues that can cause sudden death if they aren't addressed early. Therapeutic Phlebotomy (If Needed) I recommend that you get regular bloodwork and see where your red blood cell count and hematocrit levels are at.  If these are out of range, you will have thick sludgy blood which clots really easily. This is why so many cyclists who abused EPO dropped dead from cardiac events. Anabolic steroids will increase your red blood cell count and hematocrit in the exact same way. While this is typically indicative of using dosages higher than one should be in a therapeutic context, there are some individuals who can't maintain healthy levels even on legitimate therapeutic dosages of TRT. It would be wise to explore whether or not blood removal via therapeutic phlebotomy is something you could benefit from to thin out your blood and decrease the viscosity of the blood itself.  These bodybuilders did their bloodwork, they checked their blood pressure, they would go donate blood every eight weeks, and they thought they were covering their bases and staying healthy.  But something that is often overlooked is that if you are walking around with 260+ pounds of muscle, your heart has to work so much harder to pump blood and oxygen to all that muscle tissue. This puts enormous amounts of stress on the heart, and increases the size of it. The less hard your heart has to work, the better. The more weight on your body, the harder your heart has to work. Believe it or not, the heart is actually more stressed in a 300 pound bodybuilder who is lean than in a 300 pound fat guy, because muscle requires more blood and oxygen than fat tissue. Get A Cardiologist Who Has Experience With Bodybuilders I recommend that you find a cardiologist who works with athletes, and ideally bodybuilders too. These doctors will know how to interpret tests with much greater accuracy for your specific needs, and are also much more likely knowledgeable of what tests you will need done in the first place. Most general doctors will shame you for bodybuilding and will refuse to even check your health markers until you stop bodybuilding. You should find a doctor who works with bodybuilders and is willing to work with you regardless of your lifestyle choices. Get Health Insurance If you don't have it, definitely get health insurance. Especially if you're bodybuilding, if you have a cardiac event the last thing you want to think about is if you should go to the hospital or not because it's going to cost you a lot of money. This is not something you want to have to worry about. You want to be able to get any health concerned addressed as quickly as possible. I literally have heard of guys avoiding going to the hospital with infections from injections because they didn't want to pay the bill for the visit. If you have an infection, you need to get on antibiotics as soon as possible, not be staying home hoping it heals itself because you don't want to pay for a hospital visit. If you can't afford health insurance or proper health care, then you shouldn't be bodybuilding in the first place in my opinion, as it is far too risky. Health Supplements I Use And Recommend Citrus Bergamot  Citrus Bergamot improves cholesterol levels and has shown to increase high-density lipoproteins (HDL, AKA the “good” cholesterol) while lowering low-density lipoproteins (LDL, AKA the “bad” cholesterol). I use 1500 mg of Jarrow Formulas Citrus Bergamot per day. When you're on gear, even if you're just on TRT, it's quite likely that you have suboptimal lipid profile. Steroids will tank your HDL, it is nearly unavoidable, even on TRT. Anything anabolic will very likely hinder your lipid profile to some extent, even SARMs. I highly recommend Citrus Bergamot. Psyllium Husk I get about 10 to 15 grams of fiber in the psyllium husk itself. You can adjust the dose depending on how much fiber you get in your diet, but mine's pretty deficient. Psyllium husk provides a combination of insoluble and soluble fiber, which is very beneficial for gut health and optimal digestion. Not only does it improve your digestion so you can process nutrients better, but it also sweeps bad cholesterol from the digestive tract, which will lead to improved cardiovascular health. Maintaining an optimal lipid profile is critical to cardiovascular health while bodybuilding. It also helps you feel full longer if you're dieting, which is a fringe benefit. I use Viva Naturals Organic Psyllium Husk.  Curcumin Curcumin is the main active ingredient in turmeric. It's a really powerful anti-inflammatory and a strong antioxidant. It reduces the risk of high cholesterol, chronic joint pain, and other inflammation-related issues. I'm not going to make a scientific claim here, but there's evidence showing that it can lower cancer risk by quite a bit. In East Indian culture, they have a lot of food with turmeric on it, and the people who eat those foods a lot have been found to have very low cancer rates. They credit it to turmeric itself. I take 2 Doctor's Best Curcumin from Turmeric Root pills every single day.  One thing to note about turmeric/curcumin, you want to make sure it comes with Bioperine in it, which is black pepper extract. It enhances the bioavailability of curcumin by 2,000% [R]. Probiotics I can't underplay how important digestion is, and this is something I didn't take seriously when I first started bodybuilding. Probiotics help your digestive system work properly by aiding in the digestion of fats and complex carbs. I don't know how common it is, but some people have such bad gut health that they can't even lose fat in a calorie deficit simply due to the environment of their digestive system. Often, this scenario can be improved by adding in a fiber supplement and a good probiotic supplement. Keep in mind that these needs can also be fulfilled via whole foods. Most individuals just won't do that though and prefer to go the supplement route. I use 1 capsule per day of the probiotic supplement NOW Probiotic-10.  Omega-3 It is known by many bodybuilders and athletes that omega-3 fatty acids can help you gain muscle, lose body fat, and prevent injuries. But don't opt for whatever you can find, you want to look at the concentration of EPA and DHA and find the highest one possible. You also want to avoid brands that are notorious for selling rancid old omega-3's. I make sure I get at least 4 grams of high quality fresh omega-3 fatty acids in per day. I usually opt for Nordic Naturals ProOmega.  Omega-3 keeps your blood thinner as well, and for somebody who needs to maintain cardiovascular health while bodybuilding having a hardy dose of EPA and DHA every day can be a major key for keeping your blood viscosity at a healthier level. Ubiquinol (Not Coenzyme Q10) Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant naturally made in the body. A deficiency in it can lead to heart failure, chest pain and high blood pressure. As you get older, the levels in your body decrease, and supplementation becomes a necessity. This is fine when you're younger, but as you get older, your body doesn't convert CoQ10 into Ubiquinol as easily, which is the end stage antioxidant that actually matters. This is why I highly recommend that you opt for Ubiquinol instead of CoQ10. I have 400 milligrams of Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol per day. I used to take 200 mg per day, but I heard a story of a bodybuilder who was on a heart transplant list who mega-dosed Ubiquinol at 1500 mg per day and actually got himself off the heart transplant list and significantly reversed his heart damage. After hearing that story, I bumped my daily dosage up to 400 mg per day.  Hawthorn Berry Extract I take 2 Now Hawthorn Berry Extract capsules per day because it has shown to be useful in combatting heart damage.  It is primarily used to treat ailments related to the heart and blood vessels, and it has been shown to have a positive effect on heart health and blood circulation. It is a preventative measure for people with impaired cardiac function and has shown to be really useful for people in early-stage heart failure. Several double-blind studies have shown patients with early stages of cardiovascular disorders experiencing increased physical endurance and improved cardiac function after using standardized hawthorn berry extract for a few weeks. It has shown to also be useful in angina prevention. This is a bit more obscure of a supplement, but its benefits align perfectly with what we need to maintain cardiovascular health while bodybuilding, hence why I use it daily. Multivitamin A quality Multivitamin is literally the bare minimum you should be taking if you don't want to get any of the other stuff. Usually, brands you find in grocery stores are not the best ones. They're mainstream marketed and typically do not feature efficacious dosages. Some supplement companies actually have really good multivitamin formulas, you just need to look around and know what your needs are. So far, Nutrex Research Vitadapt has been my favorite. It is extremely comprehensive, uses efficacious dosages, and also features the highest quality standardizations of each specific vitamin and mineral in the formula. I take 3 tablets per day, and make sure every one in my family does the same.  With that being said, I believe that most of the other supplements I mention in this article should not be overlooked, and can be critical in sustaining cardiovascular health while bodybuilding. Vitamin K2 Numerous studies have shown that Vitamin K2 has unique positive effects on cardiovascular and bone health. The reason I use it is because I do not get enough of it in my diet (most don't) and it is crucial for arterial calcification prevention. Vitamin K2 has shown to help prevent coronary artery calcification, as well as even reverse it. I take 1 Jarrow Formulas K-Right softgel per day right now.  Astragalus Extract Astragalus has many effects on the cardiovascular system. It has the ability to reduce blood pressure. It also reduces hardening of the arteries, cholesterol absorption and plaque build up. These are all major factors that increase your risk of stroke and heart disease, and should be kept in check to maintain optimal cardiovascular health while bodybuilding. It is also possible that it improves cardiac contractions, generally strengthening your heart and its ability to pump. The reason I use it is because Astragalus is virtually the only compound that research shows can regenerate Kidneys, as well as greatly lower creatinine and raise GFR Two studies have shown that various people in kidney failure were able to get out of kidney failure by using a high dose of it. Astragalus has also shown amazing potential in an anti-aging capacity through its ability to activate telomerase activity in human T cells. I take four capsules in the morning, and four capsules at night to get 4 grams in per day. I use NOW Supplements Astragalus Extract.  Vitamin D-3 Vitamin D-3 is key for the development and maintenance of healthy bones. It also has many positive effects on the immune system, endocrine glands, and the cardiovascular system. A new study suggests that Vitamin D-3 may also improve muscle strength. In addition, Vitamin D-3 has shown to stimulate expression of androgen receptor in human skeletal muscle, making it an absolutely critical vitamin to ensure you are not deficient in as someone who not only cares about maintaining cardiovascular health while bodybuilding, but also maximizing your muscle growth potential. I take 1 NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 5000 IU soft gel per day.  Pomegranate Juice (100% Juice Not From Concentrate) Research has shown that pomegranate juice can prevent the hardening of arteries by reducing blood vessel damage, as well as reverse the progression of arterial hardening via its rich antioxidant profile. Pomegranate juice and Vitamin K2 I feel are critical to have in your daily regimen for cardiovascular health maintenance. Pomegranate juice literally scavenges existing plaque from the arteries. You want to make sure you get 100% pure Pomegranate juice NOT from concentrate. I drink 4 ounces of Lakewood Organic Pomegranate Juice per day.  Carditone Carditone is another good remedy for high blood pressure. I don't take this anymore, but when I was younger and blasted heavily aromatizing drugs like Dbol it was a godsend.  It can lower your systolic and diastolic by 10 to 15 points, respectively. And it's natural, which is pretty cool because it won't require you going to a doctor and getting a beta blocker or something like that. Obviously, if you take all possible precautions and you still have high blood pressure, you need to be getting on whatever it is to mitigate your issue. However, blood pressure is almost always manageable via lifestyle changes, whether that be via decreasing water retention, avoiding certain compounds, lowering your body weight, changing your diet, fixing your water, potassium and sodium intake, or natural supplementation, it is usually something that can be kept in the very healthy range with basic practices. If you have increased blood pressure as a result of the drugs you're taking, get off those drugs. For example, if you can't avoid high blood pressure and getting nosebleeds because your blood pressure is so high from Dbol, don't take Dbol. Whatever drugs give you the least side effects are the ones you want to try and implement into your regimen.

    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/does-muscle-size-determine-strength/",
    "date": "2016-07-05T02:47:56+00:00",
    "content": "Does Muscle Size Determine Strength? | Is A Bigger Muscle A Stronger Muscle?     Muscle Strength Vs. Muscle Size There is a very common saying, and it is, “a bigger muscle is a stronger muscle.” And I don't know where that originated from. But it has been getting passed down through the grapevine over the years. And a lot of people think progressive overload is extremely important, and it is a necessity for exerting more stimulus on your muscles. Progressive overload ensures the muscle is forced to continuously adapt to get stronger and get bigger to accommodate that increased workload you're exerting upon yourself.  I'm not saying that progressive overload isn't important, but one thing I've come to notice over the years is that most bodybuilders typically only lift extreme amounts of weight when they're on camera. When they're in the gym by themselves actually doing their real workouts and it's not for a YouTube video, they typically train with the goal of perfect mind-muscle connection and getting a ridiculous pump. This isn't necessarily with light weight, but relative to what they could lift with imperfect form, it is significantly less weight than what they are capable of if they trained purely for strength gains.  Mind-Muscle Connection Vs. Progressive Overload Relative to a guy who weighs the same who's in strongman competitions, or is training specifically for strength, bodybuilders lift a lot lighter than powerlifters. For example, you might have a powerlifter deadlifting five or six plates. And then you have a bodybuilder who could probably also deadlift five or six plates if he wanted to, or he could work up to that fairly easily. But, instead he trains with maximum mind-muscle connection and only lifts three to four plates.  I've come to realize over the years that strength doesn't always equate to size. Obviously, the bigger you get, typically the stronger you get along with it, but I think a lot of it has to do with your fast-twitch muscle fibers, and what type of training you do in the gym. Once I stopped strength training with my main goal being to beat strength PR's my strength severely decreased, even with the same amount of muscle mass. This video on my Instagram is of me when I was 20 years old, deadlifting 545 pounds for three reps.                View this post on Instagram                      545 pound #deadlift (5 pizzas and a quarter) for 3 reps a few years back when I was 20 years old #iusedtocareaboutstrengthmore #1000poundclub #strong #pr #traininsaneorremainthesame #transformation #bodybuilding #physique #lifestyle #fitnessaddict #truckstick #goodlife #thepumpisthecure #chevelle #nothinbutapeanut #backattack #imaginarylatsyndrome #simplyshredded #shredded_academy #fitness_depot #redsupplements A post shared by @ moreplates_moredates on Jul 4, 2016 at 7:47pm PDT   \n\n I had 20-30 pounds less muscle on me at that point than I do now. But, if I tried to lift that weight now, I would get destroyed. The reason for that is because I don't train purely for strength anymore. I incorporate progressive overload as the weight becomes too light that I'm using for that mind-muscle connection and getting a really good pump, so I still go heavy. But I don't strength train anymore where the goal is maxing out with as much weight as possible for a few reps. I'm sure I could probably work my way back up to that five-and-a-half-plate deadlift if I wanted to over the course of 2019 if I started strictly focusing on that, but my muscle fibers have already adapted to the type of training I do now. If I was to try and max out with those same weights I could lift when I was younger I would get killed. I still gained tons of muscle since that time, even though I'm lifting way lighter than I was then. How To Gain Size And Strength At The Same Time From a hypertrophy standpoint, what I'm doing now is more beneficial than what I was doing then. However, I think to an extent you have to incorporate both. To be clear, I'm not saying that training for strength is stupid. I think progressive overload is very important, like I mentioned already. But as far as strength being the only determinant if you get big or not, that's not the case. There are a lot of strength training advocates who will state things like “if you bench four plates, there's no way you couldn't have a great chest.” I've proved that that's not the case because my chest is horrible, and I've worked my way up to a four-plate bench. A perfect example of this are strongman competitors and powerlifters who also try to compete in bodybuilding shows. Take Larry Wheels for example.  This guy is a perfect example because he just competed in bodybuilding. Even though his lifts are extraordinary and better than every single professional bodybuilder, his muscular development is not even close to a significant amount of bodybuilders who are barely capable of lifting half the weight he is.  Train Smarter, Not Harder  What I'm trying to say is don't get caught up too much in the weight. Don't blow something out or injure yourself trying to get to a five-plate bench because you think that's the only way you're going to achieve whatever kind of size you're trying to achieve. Train smart, go for mind-muscle connection, get a good pump, stretch the fascia, incorporate progressive overload, and use heavy weights relative to your workload and what you can handle. Don't get caught up in thinking, “I need to hit a 405 bench,” or “I need to hit a six-plate deadlift because so and so does it and he's this successful”. Strength isn't everything. Progressive overload is very important. Keep that in mind when designing your training protocol. But don't get too caught up in the numbers and busting PR's all the time.

    "content": "Do Androgen Receptors Downregulate From Continuous Steroid Use?      Table of Contents ToggleDo Androgen Receptors Downregulate?Do You Need To Cycle Off Of Testosterone If You Are On TRT?Your Body's Counteracting Mechanism – MyostatinMyostatin Related Muscle HypertrophyAndrogen Receptor Activation – Swapping Compounds Is PointlessMyostatin Inhibitors Do Androgen Receptors Downregulate? There is a very common misconception in the bodybuilding community that androgen receptors downregulate during a steroid cycle, or during long-term steroid use. A plateau in muscle gain is commonly attributed to this “androgen receptor downregulation”. If you've ever cycled anabolics, you can also attest to the fact that during a new cycle the gains always seem to come within the first 8 weeks or so, and then the weeks following that it is typical to notice a blatant diminishing returns effect. If you used a long ester, this may not be the case because it will take longer to saturate the body with the drug, but the same principles still apply, they just take a few weeks longer to occur due to the longer half-life. For example, if you've taken a fast acting oral like Dbol before, you probably noticed that the increases in strength and size seem to pile on from week 1-6, and then the weeks following that (if you continued using it) are almost unnoticeable in contrast. This diminishing returns effect is not the result of androgen receptor downregulation, although most will misinterpret it as such. The reason why you can't gain muscle at a rapid pace continuously while on steroids is because Myostatin increases in the body to inhibit your body from gaining an unhealthy amount of muscle. Steroids actually upregulate androgen receptors, not downregulate. Bodybuilding gurus will commonly advise swapping compounds at week 8 of a cycle/blast phase to circumvent plateaus in muscle gain. This does absolutely nothing. The misguided belief is that the androgen receptors have become accustomed to the steroid used during the first 8 weeks, and switching to another steroid will circumvent the androgen receptor being desensitized to the first compound. For example, if someone uses Testosterone and Nandrolone for 8 weeks, the majority of gurus will advise that they swap the Nandrolone for EQ or Tren at the end of week 8. The androgen receptor doesn't “get used to” Nandrolone by the end of week 8, Myostatin levels have simply increased to a point where muscle accrual is now severely inhibited, despite the presence of supraphysiological amounts of androgens. Do You Need To Cycle Off Of Testosterone If You Are On TRT? If you take Testosterone, regardless if it's for performance-enhancing use, or for therapeutic reasons, a common inquiry is whether androgen receptors downregulate from its long-term use. Will you need to come off of Testosterone to re-sensitize to it because the androgen receptor is becoming resistant to Testosterone?  The answer is no. When you take your TRT, your androgen receptors upregulate, they don't downregulate. And what happens after that point is your body actually increases Myostatin to inhibit you from gaining more muscle than you should.  Your Body's Counteracting Mechanism – Myostatin The mechanism by which your body is inhibited from gaining absurd amounts of muscles is not because your androgen receptors are becoming desensitized to the steroids that you're using. Rather, it's your body's endogenous production of Myostatin is going up. The body has a counteracting mechanism for everything. If you eat carbs, your pancreas releases insulin to bring down your blood sugar. If you expose your skin to UV rays, your skin will increase melanin production (or try to) to create a tan that will help protect you from further damage. Myostatin increases to prevent you from gaining unhealthy amounts of muscle The human body is a big balancing act. Something most don't realize is that having a lot of muscle mass is extremely unhealthy for the cardiovascular system. Your body is fighting back to keep muscle off of you, and the more muscle you gain and the more androgens you expose your body to, the more you will induce Myostatin production to make it increasingly difficult to gain more size. There may be other regulating mechanisms that we are not yet aware of, but Myostatin seems to be the primary one. Myostatin Related Muscle Hypertrophy Flex Wheeler is a great example of what Myostatin does to the body, as well as what a lack of it can do. During a study at the University of Pittsburgh, Flex was found to have a very rare Myostatin mutation at the exon 2 position on the gene. This gene mutation prevented his body from producing normal amounts of Myostatin, consequently resulting in a much larger number of muscle fibers than the average male.

Thanks to @officiallwpgainz Stay safe & healthy with #lwpgainz A post shared by  IFBB LEGEND FLEX WHEELER (@officialflexwheeler) on Oct 10, 2018 at 1:35pm PDT   \n\n Animals and humans with inhibited Myostatin levels have consistently shown to have much greater levels of musculature relative to their non-inhibited counterparts, and based on this it isn't crazy to assume that most genetic freaks in bodybuilding developed their physiques as a result of a similar gene mutation. In theory, someone with inhibited Myostatin levels could continue to progress at rates that would be impossible for someone with normal levels. The end result being substantially greater levels of muscle gain from the exact same drugs, diet and training. Androgen Receptor Activation – Swapping Compounds Is Pointless As per the advice of a misinformed guru, once you plateau then you should swap compounds because your body is getting used to the androgens you're using. Let's delve into how the androgen receptor mediates effects in the body quickly just to clarify exactly what really happens. When you take TRT, does your body suddenly stop transcribing the effects of Testosterone correctly at week 8? Does your penis suddenly become dysfunctional and lethargy and brain fog kick in? No, anybody on TRT knows full well that as long as you keep your hormones in check with a properly managed Testosterone to Estrogen ratio, your state of well-being is consistently the same, as is sexual function. Based on the theory that androgen receptors downregulate, you would only assume that eventually the androgen receptors would also eventually desensitize to Testosterone too, as it is after all the bioidentical androgen our body naturally produces. Why would the body desensitize to Nandrolone, Dianabol, or Trenbolone, but not Testosterone? If we adopt this theory, then are we also adopting the premise that you should rotate out Testosterone after the androgen receptors have desensitized to it. This theory falls apart once you look at it in this capacity, without even delving into the science of androgen receptor activation. Obviously we don't have to swap from Testosterone to some other random unapproved drug now because we're on TRT and our bodies will supposedly get used to the Testosterone long-term. Your body doesn't just stop using the Testosterone properly at week eight. That's absurd. Everything keeps functioning correctly on that Testosterone for the duration of time you use it, but the muscle itself is what's inhibited. I'm sure guys on TRT for decades plus will attest to the fact that their libido doesn't just crash and stop working at week eight, and that's because the functions mediated through androgen receptor activation are irrelevant to the reason you're not putting on more muscle. The androgen itself (Testosterone or any other androgen) and the androgen receptor are doing exactly what they're supposed to do. Androgens bind to the androgen receptor, and after binding they induce anabolic and androgenic activity in affected tissues in the body. This is mediated via androgen receptor activation, and the androgen receptor continues to function correctly, regardless of androgen concentrations present. The problem is that your body increases Myostatin to prevent you from gaining more muscle than it wants you to. The study “Testosterone and trenbolone enanthate increase mature myostatin protein expression despite increasing skeletal muscle hypertrophy and satellite cell number in rodent muscle” exhibits exactly what happens in the body after exposure to supraphysiological amounts of exogenous androgens.  This study showed that after 29 days of administration of either Testosterone or Trenbolone, Myostatin protein levels were 197% higher in the castrated and Testosterone group, and 209% higher in the castrated and Trenbolone groups when compared to the placebo.  Relating this back to steroid cycles for bodybuilding, the efficacy of the drugs is not diminishing whatsoever, nor do androgen receptors downregulate. The brick wall you hit mid-cycle where you suddenly start plateauing out of nowhere is not something that can be overcome simply by switching to a different androgen. Once your body has recognized that it is packing on too much size, Myostatin production occurs in parallel to make it increasingly difficult to gain more muscle. This is why every pound of muscle you gain is harder than the last. The first 10 pounds you gain when you workout are easy. The next 10 pounds are fairly easy too. But you'll notice that the closer you get to the 50 pound mark of lean muscle accrual (even on anabolics) that your body will start fighting back big time, and eventually gaining just a few pounds more muscle will be more difficult for you than gaining the first 20 was. So what do you do to prevent Myostatin from inhibiting further muscle growth? Myostatin Inhibitors. That's something to be left for future research and development. Myostatin Inhibitors There are no Myostatin inhibitors that are approved for human use, or even have any human trials on them. Follistatin was a hot topic for a while, and many theorized that it could be used to inhibit Myostatin and unlock elite levels of muscle growth potential. This was a huge letdown, as research chemical companies started selling vials of Follistatin for upwards of $1000, with none of them yielding any benefits whatsoever. They were likely not legitimate Follistatin, but the entire hype train behind it left a bad taste in the mouths of bodybuilders around the globe who had all wasted their money on this junk peptide. YK11 is the most recent Myostatin inhibitor to draw the interest of bodybuilders.  While the limited data on it is impressive, there has been next to no analysis on it, except on a cellular level. There aren't even animal studies to reference. Granted, we now have hundreds, if not thousands of anecdotal report to refer to now of users who have experimented with YK11 on themselves, but at the end of the day none of these individuals are getting lab work done to check Myostatin levels before and after in their body, nor do most even know if they have legitimate YK11 or not. Regardless of the fact that YK11 and other Myostatin inhibitors are in their infancy, I do believe that down the line Myostatin inhibition will pave the future of bodybuilding pharmacology within the next half century. So, don't just go randomly shoving that in your body because it's not a good idea. Myostatin inhibition is probably going to be the main pathway by which new extreme developments come out that allow the human body to greatly exceed its natural limits. Androgens can only take you so far until Myostatin increases to prevent you from getting too muscular. If you're on TRT from your doctor's prescription, you don't need to go off your prescription and then jump back on your prescription to make it work. One of the biggest myths in the community is that androgen receptors downregulate, and by realizing how mechanisms in the body actually work, it will help you better prepare for your journey with performance enhancing drugs.

    "content": "Intermittent Fasting For Bodybuilding | Is It Good Or Bad For Gaining Muscle And Fat Loss?     The Best Diet For Adherence There is a lot of controversy around intermittent fasting for bodybuilding goals, and whether or not it is a suboptimal way to gain muscle or lose fat. There are a lot of mixed opinions, and I get asked a lot what I think about it as a diet style. I actually referenced intermittent fasting in my article detailing how to stay shredded year round. If you are trying to maintain a very low body fat percentage year-round in the most sustainable way possible that won't make you want to kill yourself and feel starving all day long, then intermittent fasting is the way to go.  Intermittent Fasting For Muscle Growth For gaining muscle, I don't think that intermittent fasting is optimal. Typically, the amount of food you're going to have to eat will exceed what you can manage in a small window of time. There are theories that delve into fat burning potential during the hours where you are fasted, and how nutrient partitioning is greatly enhanced during eating windows if you are coming off of a long period of fasting. Without getting too in depth as to why this is negligible in the grand scheme of your results, I advise you judge by what you're averaging over-the-week-calorie-intake wise, relative to your maintenance. If you're over your maintenance calorie intake, on average, you're going to gain muscle and fat. And if you're under your maintenance calorie intake, you're going to lose muscle and fat. If you're on anabolic assistance during a cut phase, then you will more than likely just lose fat, but ultimately it all comes down to calories in, versus calories out. While meal timing and frequency a a factor in muscle growth and fat loss has been disproven in certain studies, I firmly believe that spreading out your meals over the course of the day as a bodybuilder is going to be more beneficial than slamming 200 gram protein meals at once. It is only logical to assume that it is probably a bit more difficult to process your food if you shove it all in your body at once, as opposed to splitting it up into several more manageable meals. In my opinion, intermittent fasting is great for diet adherence in a calorie deficit, though, I don't necessarily think it's optimal. Longevity wise, intermittent fasting also has blatant advantages over traditional calorie restriction with meals spread out through the day, as it induces autophagy, which can help clean up cancerous cells in the body [R, R]. Intermittent Fasting To Stay Shredded Year Round Intermittent fasting is the most conducive diet to staying shredded year round. There is no diet that helps keep your appetite at bay and also simultaneously gives you such a huge amount of flexibility in the caloric density of your food choices. When you do get to eat, it doesn't feel like you're severely limited. I also notice a blatant cognitive benefit from intermittent fasting. In the morning, I'm sharper and on the ball. This is largely blood glucose and insulin-related, but the fact remains that for the span of time there is no food in my system, my productivity and attention to detail is undoubtedly far superior.  If I slam a big carbohydrate dense meal right when I wake up, it noticeably decreases my energy levels and my productivity. When I'm fasting I literally get more done.  How I Utilize Intermittent Fasting For Bodybuilding I typically favor intermittent fasting for sustaining a shredded physique, rather than achieving it. When my goal is losing fat, my diet model doesn't change from when I was bulking other than slightly decreasing the quantities of the food I'm eating, or swapping out certain meals for less calorie dense alternatives. Largely, my diet stays more or less the same though. Once I get to a point where the diet is unbearable and I'm hungry all the time (typically around the sub 7% body fat range), that is when I personally deploy intermittent fasting as a means of controlling my cravings. Once you get to that point where you are hungry all day long, the diet model isn't sustainable, and that is where I find intermittent fasting shines most in a bodybuilding context. From a muscle accrual standpoint, intermittent fasting is not optimal whatsoever. From a muscle retention standpoint, I believe there is a disadvantage in restricting yourself of nutrients for the majority of your day as well. However, something being a bit less optimal at the expense of actually making the diet model sustainable is absolutely a smart trade off for a significant amount of individuals. Many people simply can't stick to a heavily restricted diet spread into several tiny unsatisfying meals. Anytime I incorporate intermittent fasting for bodybuilding purposes (I often incorporate it for cognitive and longevity factors as well), I am not at the mercy of my leptin and ghrelin levels being all over the place to nearly the same extent as I would be with a traditional calorie restriction diet model.  Once you are at that point where your quality of life is being hindered and you are hungry all the time trying to stay in a calorie deficit, that's when intermittent fasting becomes incredibly useful to maintain a shredded physique that would otherwise be near impossible to maintain long-term. In the context of bulking, intermittent fasting is totally out of the question for me because I can never get my calories in if I'm just cramming them into two giant meals. I'm sure for some people up to a certain point when they're bulking, it works for them. But you're going to eventually hit a caloric intake where it's just too much to handle in a small window of time, and you'll probably be forced to spread your meals out a bit more. If you get to that point during a bulk phase, or even during a bulk in general, I think you should consider splitting your meals up for ease of digestion. I feel that it is often overlooked that overloading yourself with nutrients in one meal can potentially put unnecessary stress on the digestive system, leading to malabsorption, or other digestive issues that may have been mitigated by eating more manageable, smaller portions. If I slam over 100 grams of protein at once, I will often pay the price later on the toilet.

    "content": "How To Build Social Circles In College With Attractive Women Quickly | Even When You Don’t Know Anyone     The Moment I Learned That Rejections Aren't All Dead Ends This strategy can be used wherever you live, regardless of what school you are at. While some of you guys might be in fraternities, or have thriving social scenes at the schools you go to, there are a lot of colleges and universities that have no parties, no night life, and are essentially just commuter schools. Commuter schools are schools where the majority of students will drive or bus up to class, go to class, and then leave. And even among the students living on residence, the social scene is weak. If you go to a commuter school, or you aren't well connected to your school's party scene, you need to make things happen yourself. Fortunately, this is actually incredibly easy to do if you have above average looks, style, and have some balls. Having a great dating life is ultimately a numbers game. The better looking you are, the more stylish you are, and the more social freedom you have, the more favorable the numbers will be for you. From age 19-22 literally all I did was workout and approach women. Getting laid was my only concern at the time, as well as maximizing my physique in order to improve my results. I'd often find myself with a couple dates lined up per night, and that seems like an insane time commitment but that's just all I cared about at the time. So, obviously when you get into the numbers game, you're going to get rejected sometimes. This should be expected. A great approach:lay ratio would literally be 10 approaches per 1 lay, and even that is extremely generous for most guys. Get used to being rejected, it is inevitable. Typically, when a girl rejects you, she will say something like “I have a boyfriend” or “I'm seeing someone”, even if she isn't. Sometimes they're just not sexually available for one reason or another. Bad mood, family member died recently, in debt, whatever the reason is that's stressing them out, quite often the stars won't align where a girl is single and sexually interested in you at the exact same time you approach her. Often times, she'll actually be seeing someone, or she's just not interested. Girls are very timid, so it's actually rare for a girl to just flat out say no. What the majority of guys do (including myself when I first started all this stuff) is accept the rejection and leave the interaction and never see the girl again.  I decided to take a chance one day and try something a bit different, and this tactic ended up working so well that it turned every interaction into a potential massive benefit for me. Even the rejections.  What To Do When You Get Rejected During A Cold Approach On Campus I would hit on girls just like I normally would, and then if I got rejected, or she says that she has a boyfriend, I would get her number anyways and I would say, let's just be friends. Now, a lot of you guys are going to think why would you do that? You're not gonna get anywhere, this is a colossal waste of time. You're in the friend zone, you're going to have to put in all this effort to get this chick, she's probably not going to leave her boyfriend for you, etc. She's already not interested, why would you do this? The goal of this strategy is NOT to try and win this girl over and push yourself through the friend zone into her pants, do not misconstrue what I'm saying here. The goal is to get into this girl's social circle of other attractive girls for massive instant social proof, and you will also be able to easily pick off some silver platter lays among these friend groups pretty consistently. Remember, I went to a commuter school. No one really knows anyone at a commuter school, and you might have a handful of friends at most that also go there, and you're probably not in the exact same classes. Everyone has their own schedule for the degree they are trying to get, and you're going to often find yourself in scenarios in college and university where you're by yourself between classes. Unless you're in a very tight knit fraternity or something like that, if you go to a commuter school or you just don't know anyone, you have to create your own opportunities. Side note – I guarantee that even if you went to the most boring and uneventful college in the country, if you pushed yourself to commit full time to self-improvement and talking to girls, you would get laid exponentially more than you would if you were in the best frat in the country. While you will get girls handed to you on a silver platter in some scenarios in prominent party schools, your results will always be limited by your looks, style and social freedom. Even if you're at the most crazy party on earth, if you're a social recluse, you're not going to get laid more often than not (unless you're exceptionally good looking), and the same goes for fraternities. Comparing a high level of social freedom at a random boring school vs waiting for girls to fall on your lap in party schools with average social skills, the first scenario will always yield a better outcome. Every single day you are on campus, you will see hot girls sitting around on break studying by themselves, sitting on their phones, listening to music, walking between classes, and in general just wasting time by themselves waiting for their next class to start. It's not uncommon for there to be blocks of times upwards of 3-4 hours between classes where students will literally sit in the same spot bored out of their mind waiting for their next class to start. If these girls are sexually available, you meet their looks threshold, and you're not completely socially inept (even if you are you will improve very quickly), when you approach them they will give you their number and go out with you. If a girl isn't sexually available, but you still meet their looks threshold and can hold a relatively interesting conversation, more often than not, they will still want to be friends with you if you propose the alternative. From now on, when a chick says “I have a boyfriend” or “I'm seeing someone”, tell them “that's cool, let's just be friends” and grab their number anyways. It's mutually understood that there are giant blocks of time that there is nothing to do, and if you have someone to keep you company during those time frames, friends are more than welcomed, and you'd be surprised how many attractive girls on campus are literally just sitting there everyday with nobody to talk to. As the population of men becomes proportionally more beta, there will be less and less men taking advantage of this as well, consequently setting you apart from every other Joe Schmo who would only have the balls to walk up to her in a club inebriated, or send her a message online. Tell her that next time you both have a matching break on campus that you should meet up and grab coffee. Remember, the point is not to push this chick's boundaries and to try and steal her from her boyfriend, in fact I strongly advise against that, even if she starts to come around. It just feeds your social proof even more with her friends, and makes things exponentially easier for you when you go out with her and your new social circles, which we will get to shortly. Can Guys Be “Just Friends” With Hot Girls? Girls more often than not will believe that guys can be “just friends” with attractive girls, whereas men are typically more inclined to say that it is impossible. Personally, I do not think it is possible for a guy to have a close friend who's a very attractive girl and not have some sort of sexual tension in the middle of the situation. Even if they're “just friends”, no male with healthy hormone levels would ever have zero sexual attraction towards a 10/10 chick that he's hanging out with. Again, despite the goal being befriending the girls who have boyfriends/are seeing someone, the REAL goal is actually to catapult yourself into her social circle as quickly as possible. After you get a number from a girl you're trying this with, you want to treat it exactly like you would a guy friend.  If you were bored on campus and had nothing to do, you'd text one of your buddies to see if they're free to chill.  Same applies for these chicks.  You want to treat them like your friend, and by taking sex completely off the table, you will find these interactions a lot lower stress, and it becomes pretty easy to develop a solid friendship fairly quickly with them.  How To Catapult Yourself Into High Caliber Social Circles Once you set a day and time that you are going to hang out as friends, the goal is to enjoy her company as much as possible, and be yourself. If you have decent social intuition, it's pretty easy to hit it off with most girls and be a generally likeable, especially when you don't have constant impulses in the back of your head trying to figure out how you are going to transition this into getting laid. Once you're hanging out with her, sipping your coffee or doing whatever you guys have decided on doing, talk. Straight up, just build rapport. Talk about mutual interests, school, work, partying, etc. After you've hung out with this girl a couple times, this is when you pitch a meetup at a club, bar, party, or wherever the go to places are where you live. “You bring some of your friends and I'll bring some of my friends and let's go to _ club downtown Friday night”. I've done this by myself where I've met up with social circles of 5-10 chicks, I've done this with a couple of my friends where I've dragged them to the club just so I could have a couple guys there to chill with while I met up with a social circle of 5-10 chicks, I've done this in every possible variation possible, and I'm telling you, it works. Before I get into exactly how this plays out, you have to acknowledge and realize the following. If a girl meets up with you a second time on campus, it's because she enjoys your company. No girl would respond to a text or go out of their way to meet up with a guy if they didn't genuinely enjoy their company, I promise you that. Just like if some guy you knew from high school who you don't want to hang out with asked you to hang out, you'd make something up or you'd ignore them. The same applies for girls. If she meets up with you, she thinks you're cool and worth chilling with. Now, keep in mind the context of this situation. This isn't a typical friend zoned situation. Presumably, you're this chill, cool guy who had the balls to go up to her in the middle of school and strike up a good conversation with generally interesting things to say that threw her off-guard. This is how she sees you, even if you're in the friend zone, she's fully able to grasp how forward and confident a man must be in this day and age to just flat out walk up to a stranger they find attractive and try to take what they want, which is exactly what you did. Any guy who has hit on a girl like this before (assuming your looks, style and social skills are above average) will have any reasonably logical woman believing that you are a player and probably have lots of options. Even when I was a virgin, the first girl I slept with thought I was a stud solely because of how I hit on her. I was clueless, but the context behind how I asked her out and my social intuition made her assume I was a guy with huge amounts of experience. This is what differentiates you from typical guys in the friend zone. In the context of girls who reject you that you're trying to use as a catapult, if your looks, style and social freedom are in check, they will see you as a high quality man, regardless of the fact that they might not planning on sleeping with you. Plain and simple, men who can confidently talk to strangers and have high level social skills are a dying breed, and women can recognize it.  Even 6 years ago when I was doing this full-time, I can't even count how many times I've had girls tell me how shocked they were to get hit on in the middle of the day like that, or how they would go home and tell all their friends about meeting me and go on and on about this unique situation where a guy came up to her out of the blue in the middle of campus and caught her completely off guard and got her number. That was 6 years ago, when apps like Tinder were not even mainstream yet, and social media was not nearly as massive as it is now. Even back then, I estimated that 10% of men would get 90% of the women. Nowadays, that ratio is probably even more favorable for the elite. I was still doing online dating, but supplementing with cold approaching and figuring out how to build social circles in college is going to be an integral part of you maximizing your options, and building a massive social network that pushes your value through the roof, while decreasing your outcome dependence in parallel. You'll quickly start to notice how much less you give a shit about outcomes once you have a lot of options. Going To The Club, Bar, Or A Party With Her Friends Most girls don't have cool guy friends who they want to go clubbing with. The reason for this is that guys have an extremely difficult time being friends with attractive girls, and even guys who are locked in the friend zone will often eventually release their pent up horny energy and try and molest the chick they've been pining after for years, regardless of the fact that she has a boyfriend. Most girls with reasonable intelligence know this, and won't put themselves in a situation where a guy they know low key wants to sleep with her will cross boundaries when they're out. Girls who have boyfriends still want to have a good time, and that's why they'll go downtown with just their girlfriends. They don't want to have to worry about Joe Shmoe getting a bit too hammered and trying to make a move on her in the middle of the night when she'll inevitably have to shut him down. This is exactly why you will so incredibly easily be able to catapult yourself into these high caliber social circles. You're likely one of the only cool guys she knows who's actually fun to hang out with and will just be friends with her and not cross boundaries. And you're very likely the type of guy who one of her single friends would be interested in, especially because she genuinely likes hanging out with you and will do 90% of the work for you, which is the first piece of value you quickly extract from this dynamic. If you play this right, within a few weeks you can literally build a few high caliber social circles with really hot girls just via your rejections, and that's not even accounting for the girls who you've successfully approached, got numbers from, and are going on dates with. So you can see how this quickly expands into this vast network of high quality women that branched off from you literally being a nobody who has no friends. At my commuter school university, I literally went from knowing nobody, to building several social circles comprised almost entirely of hot girls, as well as knocking out my first 10 lays with girls via successful cold approaches and online dating, within 6 months of committing my life to this. This snowballed as the years progressed, but I want to really lay out a firm time frame for you guys exemplifying just how quickly you can completely change your life. I literally believed I was unattractive and nobody wanted to be with me, but the reality was that I was just not doing a fucking thing with my life. I was sitting at home on my computer studying “game” and “PUA” theories, but I wasn't out there talking to girls at all! The Massive Impact Social Proof Will Have On Your Results The value of meeting up with the social circles of attractive girls you were initially rejected by on the front-end is that you essentially have a wingwoman and massive hype train following you into meeting the friends via the main girl. By the time you actually get to the club and you are meeting this girl's friends for the first time, you already have some massive social proof through this girl because she's gonna tell all of her girlfriends about you before you meet up. They're going to say, where are we going tonight? What are we doing? And she's going to tell them about the guy she met at school who had a massive set of cojones and confidently struck up a great conversation with her, and didn't get butt hurt when she rejected him, as well as how funny, chill and generally awesome he is. Then she's going to tell them more about how you've been hanging out, what you're like, and how you're meeting up with them at _ club/bar downtown (or wherever you're going). They wouldn't be meeting up with you if she thought otherwise, I promise you. She will do 90% of the work for you, and before they've even met you, I guarantee that one of her friends will probably have fairly high level of interest in you. Once you meet up, even if none of her friends are into you, as long as you have some strong rapport with the main chick (which you do), you're going to have an entourage of hot girls with you all night, and this is where the true value of this comes into play. Never Underestimate Having An Attractive Wingwoman A wingwoman is often times much better than a wingman. At least in my experience. Social proof is a very real concept, and a girl who sees a man with other attractive women will subconsciously perceive that man as much higher value. Who do you think has more social proof, the guy who's hanging out with a couple dudes, or the guy who's surrounded by 5-10 hot girls and a couple dudes? The dudes being your friends if you wanted to bring them. Once you have a few high caliber social circles who enjoy hanging out with you, you now have several groups you can plan to go clubbing or bar hopping with, who inherently pass on massive social proof to you wherever you go. And once you get more advanced, you can start to commingle two of your high caliber social circles, and feed your social proof exponentially higher to the other groups, thus pushing your stock even higher through the roof to these chicks. Even if literally none of these girls want to sleep with you, the nucleus of these social circles being the chicks you fostered strong friendships with will solidify your stock in the groups and pre-social proof you to them, greatly improving the likelihood that they will all like you too, and more often than not a friend or two will want to hook up with you solely based off of this. This isn't even the direct benefit that you are seeking though, the point is that just a few rejections can indirectly lead to you cultivating social circles comprised of dozens of attractive girls who genuinely want to hang out and party with you, and wing for you with girls in the club/bar/parties/wherever you are. Cold approaching a chick at the club who knows you're there with 10 high tier women vs cold approaching a chick at the club when you're there by yourself, or your boys are leaning against a wall watching your interaction intently, can often have quite different outcomes. I can't even describe how effective this actually is in practical application, and it significantly increases the probability of you connecting with girls you may have not had a chance with otherwise. The fact that this all stems from your rejections, which otherwise yield 0 value for 99% of guys, I feel is what makes this especially worth exploring, as it has worked for me several times in the past, and I feel that it is a completely overlooked strategy.

    "content": "How To Get Shredded Eating McDonalds Every Day | IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros)     Getting Shredded On Junk Food Obviously, trying to get shredded eating McDonalds every day is not the optimal way to diet. This post is not meant to assert that you should diet down eating McDonalds every day, it is simply meant to illustrate how the metabolism works, and how daily calorie intake relative to daily energy expenditure is ultimately what will determine if you lose fat or not. McDonalds food is not micronutrient dense. It also doesn't have good macronutrient ratios in terms of protein relative to fat content. With that being said, if you really wanted to, there's no reason why you couldn't lose as much fat as you want while still consuming McDonalds every single day. It all comes down to the fundamentals of getting shredded and bulking up. And the fundamentals of each essentially boil down to calories in versus calories out. You have a certain amount of calories your body expends on a daily basis. This is determined through your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), coupled with your activity level. You can figure this out with a maintenance calorie calculator, which calculates how many calories you can eat per day to keep your weight exactly the same. By calculating your BMR (basal metabolic rate) factored in with however much physical activity you're doing on a weekly basis, you can figure out roughly how many calories you burn per day. Once you know this figure, you can calculate exactly how much calorie restriction will be necessary to start losing fat. If you want to lose weight, you have to eat less than this maintenance number.  Counting Calories Is The Most Important Thing You Need To Do The reason why somebody would have trouble losing weight eating McDonalds is not because it's crappy junk food, but because it's calorically dense. Most people don't count how many calories they are eating on a daily basis, which often leads to overconsumption. Most people view their diet in terms of quantity, as opposed to how many calories are in the food they are eating. For example, a junior chicken from McDonalds is 370 calories.  If you ate 3 of these per day, that would be an additional 1,110 calories per day, which isn't insignificant for the amount of food you are consuming. Visually, it doesn't look like much, as 3 junior chickens probably only have about six to eight ounces of total chicken in them. However, the way they bread the chicken, the unhealthy oils they cook it in, and the sauce they cover it in, all add hidden calories that you may otherwise not be considering. At a first glance, many people would assume that they are eating the equivalent of a few ounces of chicken (90 calories) with lettuce (almost 0 calories), a bun (maybe 100 calories), and a bit of sauce (maybe 50-100 calories). An uneducated guess would probably be closer to 250 calories. And most wouldn't even bother to look at the nutrition facts anyways. It's not very satiating, and can start to push your daily calorie intake up pretty high without you even noticing. People gain weight eating junk food by over-consuming, not by eating junk food itself. Hypothetically, if the maintenance calorie calculator says the amount of calories you expend per day is 2800, and you ate 1110 calories of those via junior chickens, you now only have 1690 calories that you have to fill with other things until you reach your maintenance. Ensure that you're eating less than those 1690 calories if you want to have any chance of losing weight. If you eat at maintenance or above it, your body will store the excess as either fat or muscle. If you are in a deficit, your body will dip into stored energy to make up for that deficit to reach your maintenance. If you ate 2600 calories with a 2800 calorie maintenance, your body has 2600 calories (energy) to fuel your activities and your everyday physiological functions on that day. Your body will dip into your stored energy (fat stores or muscle tissue) to make up for those 200 calories that it is no longer getting from food consumption. Restricting Your Calorie Intake Will Result In Fat Loss, Even If You Eat McDonalds Through this process of caloric restriction, you can effectively burn fat off your body until you're as lean as you want. A calorie deficit can also be achieved via cardio, weightlifting or whatever your favorite way of expending energy is. Ideally you would utilize a combination of slow, tapered caloric restriction, and slow tapered increases in energy expenditure via physical activity. Don't restrict yourself too much too quickly though, or else you will end up in a position where you can't lose weight even when you're eating as little as your girlfriend's maintenance.  At the end of the day, it's a game of calories in versus calories out. You have to eat less than your body expends or else you won't lose weight. It is possible to lose weight literally only eating chocolate or ice cream every single day as long as the calories of everything you ate during that day add up to less than what your body expends. It should go without saying that I do not recommend this whatsoever, as it is not even close to optimal for muscle retention or health. I know some guys who eats cheeseburgers every day as part of their diet. They need that little treat in there to help them stick to their diet. Is it ideal? No. However, if it is the only way you will adhere to a diet, then in some cases it can be more beneficial to eat a bit of junk every day to ensure you stick to your daily calorie allotment. Diet adherence and being oblivious to the importance of counting calories is the number one reason why most people fail trying to lose fat, and keeping it off.

    "content": "Dorian Yates Genetics And Training Style – Which Was More Important?     Dorian Yates Work Ethic Dorian Yates is highly regarded for his extreme work ethic. He is often referred to as an example of hard work beating talent–or genetics. Many truly believe that he was just such a hard worker in the gym that it allowed him to overcome genetic deficiencies and grind his way to six consecutive Mr. Olympia titles.  Dorian being so diehard about bodybuilding and having an insane level of work ethic is often said to be the critical factor that separated him from all of his competitors. In my personal opinion, this couldn't be any further from the truth. The truth is, Dorian Yates had some of the best genetics in the history of bodybuilding.  Dorian Yates Genetics Are Elite Dorian's biceps are often brought up as a criticism, and typically form the basis of the entire argument that he had subpar genetics relative to the bodybuilders he edged out. Dorian inspired thousands that the key to being successful in bodybuilding was not his genetics at all, but his hard work and dedication.

Yes, adherence to a strict diet and intelligent training regimen is what will ultimately determine if you grow or not, but the reality is that it is not very difficult to do this, even for the average person. What is difficult to do (impossible for 99.9% of us) is hyper-respond to performance enhancing drugs, training, and walk around with low levels of Myostatin. This was Dorian Yates' physique before he started training –  This was Dorian Yates' physique after only nine months of training.  After only 9 months of training, Dorian was more muscular than 99% of aspiring bodybuilders, including the ones who take absurd amounts of steroids and other PEDs. I wasn't even close to this, even after half a decade of training. Even now, after 10 years of working out, I'm probably a similar size to the picture above. Within a handful of years, Dorian was competing on the Olympia stage against the best in the world. This is another perfect example of a guy who hyper-responds to training and drugs. I've talked about this many times before, you'll know after your first cycle if you have Mr. Olympia caliber genetics.  The same holds true for Dorian Yates, and you can see for yourself how he quickly he exploded.

In recent times, one of the most pestering issues is people’s fascination with success. The digital revolution and its social media sidekicks further amplified the idea that you can do whatever you want and be successful. This worldview argues that achieving success is easy, cheerful, and pleasant. But mine is a different, more fundamental, and true story about success. This success that we’re talking about takes discipline, guts, hard work, and unmatched dedication. Read more on the DY Nutrition blog at http://bit.ly/2E8UjNN Link also in my bio ? A post shared by  Dorian Yates (@thedorianyates) on Oct 10, 2018 at 10:58am PDT   \n\n How Hard Is It To ACTUALLY “Train Hard”? Keep in mind, I'm absolutely not trying to take away from Dorian's work ethic. He very well appeared to be one of the hardest workers in the gym. And maybe he even did train harder than the other guys who he competed against.  But the reality is that in bodybuilding, unless you're lazy as hell, it's not very hard to go to failure on an exercise. It doesn't take that much mental fortitude to go to failure, at least in my experience. It's also not rocket science to perform an exercise with proper form. I go to the gym 4 days per week as of now. I train very hard and perform each exercise until my muscle fails and I literally can't even lift the weight anymore. That's failure, you can't really go harder than that unless you have a spotter who will assist you through partial reps, and force reps past failure. I've done it, and I'm sure you've done it as well to squeeze out a bit more muscle activation and breakdown. But, the reality is that failure is failure, and I'm sure a lot of you guys are in fact training to total failure, because it really is not that mentally taxing to do so unless you're extremely weak minded. It's one thing if you're actually lazy and just go to the gym to move weights around and go through the motions on each exercise. Yes, that will make or break someone's progress. However, the majority of us who take bodybuilding seriously train hard and stress the muscle to the point of muscular failure every single time we walk into the gym. Is Training Like Dorian Yates The Secret To Being A Top Tier Bodybuilder? The fact of the matter is that you don't need to unlock some next tier mental state to be able to train hard. It's not the separating factor between who becomes Mr. Olympia and who doesn't in my opinion. If you train to failure, stretch and contract the muscle effectively during each exercise with proper form and employ progressive overload you're getting the job done. If you bring a training partner in to scream at you and help you knock out partial reps past failure for a bit more muscle breakdown, is that what will suddenly pack 100 pounds of muscle on your frame and separate a Mr. Olympia champion from an aspiring amateur who just can't gain the size he needs? Absolutely not. Dorian Yates is an example of elite caliber genetics that hyper-respond to the bodybuilding lifestyle. Was his diet and training immaculate? Yeah, obviously because those are prerequisites for inducing growth. You need to break down muscle tissue. Then you need to eat enough to recover. But, the hyper-responding to those in unison with the performance enhancing drugs in particular is exactly what happened with Dorian Yates. As well as every other top tier champion.   Some of these top pros are so genetically gifted that they even won high level bodybuilding shows eating complete garbage before they understood the importance of intelligent diet principles.  A Genetic Reality Check There are a lot of guys out there that truly believe they will become a high caliber bodybuilder one day, even after they have been grinding in the amateur league for years with minimal/non-existent success. Dorian is often referred to as a source of inspiration, because he is seen as an example of a guy who made it, despite his “bad genetics”.  Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.  That's a pretty popular quote, and to some extent it is absolutely true. In the context of bodybuilding though, hard work still won't beat talent, even when the talent is eating McDonalds and hot dogs every day for their contest prep and probably training with a much lower level of intelligence than you are. That's the harsh reality of bodybuilding, and I have seen far too often guys who will run themselves into the ground (literally) with absurd amounts of drugs thinking that eventually they will get where they aspire to be, even if they are still placing poorly at national level shows, or even entry level regional shows, for years on end. I have no idea where this misconception came from that Dorian Yates genetics are anything less than top tier, but it certainly is not the case. Just looking at Dorian Yates' transformation in nine months is pretty enlightening and is certainly a blow to the ego for many deluded bodybuilders who still aren't even that big after years of blasting several grams of anabolics. I take it as a reality check though. It wasn't in the cards for me to go on and try and compete at the highest level and I faced the harsh reality that being a mass monster wasn't in the cards for me, and I accepted it. I laugh now when I think back to when I was 20 years old and I literally believed that I would be 265 pounds shredded by the time I graduated from University. Some guys get so deluded and trick themselves into believing that they are just one new exotic drug choice away, or one diet change away, or one training style change away from taking their physique from above average, to top tier 0.01% IFBB pro levels. The allure of the next cycle being the one that changes the game. Ah, I remember that feeling fondly. I can see how this post may come across as contradictory to my most recent post about bodybuilding being a marathon and not a sprint, but the contexts are completely different. Yes, it takes years to build a quality physique, however, it is very apparent when you have Dorian Yates caliber genetics within a very short span of time, as results that would take the average person 5 years to achieve will take someone like Dorian 6-9 months. No, you don't need to be like Dorian in an underground dungeon with a guy screaming at you through partials until you puke in order to make gains. Train hard, train properly, don't get injured, eat enough, and if you're a hyper responder too, then great. Ride it out and take advantage of it by competing at the highest level by all means. But, if you just have average genetics, which you more than likely do like me, please don't drive yourself into the ground chasing something that's unachievable. It is crucial that you give yourself a reality check if this is you, because there's a lot of guys that literally die at 30 to 40 years old chasing this pipe dream. You'll know very quickly if you are genetic freak, and if the best choice for you would be pushing for that extreme level of competition or not.

Men in general are becoming more and more feminine. A lot of people think it is associated with the decline in natural testosterone levels as time goes on. Some people think it's just the result of increasing amounts of social media use. While many people see this is a negative thing, I want to talk about why this is a good thing, and why people shouldn't be so disappointed about how we're progressing as a species.  The Advantage For The Small Proportion Of Alpha Males The amount of competition is lower than ever for true alpha males. If you care about self-improvement at all, you'd be stoked that other guys are being complete pussies right now, and you have a significant competitive advantage. In the dating pool, women still want the stereotypical alpha male. No, not someone who is mean on purpose or treats women like crap (common misconception). An alpha male is a man who is completely outcome independent, emotionally secure, and confident. The same traits are still universally attractive to women that are becoming more and more difficult to find in current day. And the reason for that I believe is partially hormonal, but mainly social media driven. The Effect Social Media Has On Social Awareness As the years have gone on, it's become more and more widely accepted to stay in your house and stare at your computer and phone all day. Humans are creatures of comfort, I'm sure you've heard that before. The more you put them in a comfortable situation, the harder it's going to be for them to put themselves in extremely uncomfortable situations. One of those situations is talking to girls. An 18 year old girl literally thinks it is weird and socially awkward to receive a phone call from a guy now. If you're not texting, dm'ing, whatsapp’ing, or snapping, then you're “weird”. Nobody talks on the phone now, which I think is hilarious, because it's literally why the thing was invented in the first place. But beyond that, everyone is meeting people on Tinder, Bumble, or on other, dating apps, or they are dm'ing them on Instagram. That's how people are getting girlfriends now and meeting people. And that's fine, I strongly advise taking advantage of that. Use your looks to your advantage. If you have good pictures, you're going to excel online, that's just how it works. But how you can get a cut above is also taking advantage of the fact that men are all living their lives out online, exclusively trying to DM girls and message them on Tinder. Is there anybody going up to that hot chick at the grocery store anymore, asking her how her day was and asking her out? No. No one's really doing that because guys are at home on Tinder or on Instagram. And that's just what people do now for staying in their social bubble. Granted, they're going to go on dates, and they're going to get girls via that. But, the literal cold approaching a stranger that you don't know and striking up a conversation is something that most beta males find completely terrifying. This is something you can take advantage of. Women Are Attracted To Alpha Males A hundred years ago, guys met girls solely through approaching and talking to them. Nowadays, the only way beta males meet girls is through their phones. This is where you will stand out because you can be that guy who not only made a girls day by catching her off guard, but you will likely be one of the only guys talking to her who is not being a completely socially unaware lemming. By showing how much more ballsy you are than every other guy who is blowing up her phone, you automatically set yourself apart from the pack in a massive way. These scenarios are becoming so much rarer nowadays that girls will literally be fixated on that unique interaction they had where a guy just flat out confidently walked up to her, struck up an interesting conversation, and asked her out. You'd be shocked how many women will go home and tell all their girlfriends about the amazing encounter they had with you earlier. This amazing unique encounter literally involved a time investment of 2-3 minutes on your part, but completely made this girls day and instantly moved you to the front of her lineup of male candidates. You can't beat a face to face interaction. Just like online dating, your success ratio of cold approaches will still be low'ish (depending on how good looking you are and socially aware), but remember, this is still a numbers game. However, once you do cold approach the girls who are sexually available (it's a matter of time as it is a numbers game), your impact on her in 2-3 minutes will completely outweigh the hours of leg work Joe Shmoe has been putting in over Tinder/text messaging for the past week. Men Are Evolving In Reverse For the evolution of the male species, the beta’ization of the male population is not going to bold well for us.  However, at an individual level, as somebody who's looking to improve your quality of life as much as physically possible, you and I can take advantage of this severely. Be that alpha guy who's unlike the rest of the beta males who are at home, sitting on their phone all day. Strike up conversations with women when you want to, there is absolutely zero reason to be inhibited by the comfort of social media, as it will just have an overall net negative on your quality of life at the end of the day. This isn't just about approaching women either, social intuition and extremely low levels of social anxiety are things you will indirectly gain out of these interactions at an incredibly quick rate if you are consistent, and these interactions will also translate directly into your performance in job interviews, business presentations, public speaking, and any other medium where social skills are of the utmost importance. Even just making friends in general, having top tier social skills is HUGE. As time goes on, men are going to continue getting worse and become increasingly repressed. The population of women continues to rise while the population of men continues to rise in parallel. Despite this, the proportion of men who are true alpha males that women want to be with continues to get worse. 10% Of Men Get 90% Of The Women As the population rises, the proportion of beta males that women find unattractive will continue to trend in a pattern conducive to the success of alpha males. This is why only 10% of men get 90% of the women. There's never been a better time to actually be what a stereotypical man would be on paper, because there really are none. Hopefully this serves as a wake up call if you're not operating like this already. Next time you're in public and you see a an attractive woman you're interested in; Instead of going home and just going through your phone for the rest of the day, go up to that chick in person. Go make her day and try to get her number. Should things go well, you'd create a new dating option for yourself, and she will meet a high value man who can also improve her quality of life in return. The risk:reward ratio on these situations is massive as the time investment for a cold approach is so low, and the impact they have nowadays is so high, and will continue to get higher. Things may be getting worse for the male population in general, but for you, things will get better if you take advantage of it. Set yourself apart from the herd.

    "content": "How Long Does It Take To Look Like You Lift? | How Many Years Did It Take Me?     Individual Perspective Will Determine If You Look Like You Lift The definition of looking fit varies individual to individual. Each one of us has a subjective feeling towards different body shapes and builds. For many girls, their perception of muscular development is so vastly different from guys in the bodybuilding community, that they'll perceive someone like Taylor Lautner from Twilight the same way we'd perceive a Mr Olympia champion like Phil Heath.  Everyone’s perspective is different when it comes to the ideal physique. How Many Years It Took Me To Look Like I Lift As an avid bodybuilding fan, my standards to look like you lift are substantially higher than the average person. In my personal opinion, it took me about 2-3 years before I truly looked like I lift. And by that I mean it took me 2-3 years to progress my physique to a point where people would be able to tell in a T-Shirt that I have a really solid physique, and assume that I work out often. Within that 3 year time frame, I didn't miss more than a few training sessions, if any at all. My diet was also on point and always conducive to growing in bulking phases, or stripping off fat in cutting phases. The main takeaway from this and piece of advice I can give you is to BE PATIENT. Building your body is a marathon, not a sprint.  Create Long Term Goals You shouldn't be discouraged at all after your first, second, or even third cycle of bulking and cutting phases if you are still far from your goals. 90% to 99% of gym goers fail to stay on track and be consistent for more than a few months at a time. Most of them get the motivation to commit to a fairly strict regimen, and when they don't see immediate results, they lose motivation and give up. This is a cyclical process that inevitably prevents the vast majority of individuals from ever making substantial amounts of progress. They motivate themselves to get on a diet and get in the gym, stick to it for a few weeks, or maybe a few months, and then they fall off. This happens over and over as the years progress, and the net result of it is that their physique progression becomes completely stagnant. This lack of commitment prevents them from ever seeing any notable progress at all, and is the exact reason why 9/10 individuals who go to your local gym who you've seen there for years look exactly the same as they did years ago when you first started training there. Still lifting the same weights, probably still not utilizing progressive overload because they're just going through the motions, probably, not training to failure, probably not eating enough macronutrients to even recover sufficiently from their training sessions to induce muscle growth, not sticking to a strict regimen for more than a few months at a time, and the list goes on. Don’t be that guy. The simplest hack is to be on point for years on end. Have the discipline and patience to enjoy the process and be brutally consistent. Once you truly start doing this, you will start noticing how quickly your results snowball, and the compounding effect being on point year round truly has on your physique progression.

    "content": "Insulin & Body Fat Gain – The Number 1 Reason Why 90% Of Bodybuilders Just Get Fat      Table of Contents ToggleDoes Insulin Make You Fat?Misinformation In The Bodybuilding CommunityReverse Engineering The Purpose Of Insulin UseInsulin Protocols In BodybuildingWhat A Smarter Insulin Protocol Would Look Like In A Bodybuilding ContextBodybuilding Coach/Guru Red FlagsRelated Does Insulin Make You Fat? No. A diet with too many calories makes you fat. The problem with insulin use in bodybuilding is that the protocols given out typically don’t make any logical sense. The problem boils down to bodybuilders eating excessive amounts to match their arbitrary insulin dosages, as opposed to how a diabetic would use inuslin (the correct way) where the insulin dosage matches the diet. The diet isn’t meant to be changed to match an arbitrary dosage of insulin  Misinformation In The Bodybuilding Community Insulin protocols are something that I saw extremely frequently when I was first getting into hardcore bodybuilding. They were typically centered around periworkout nutrition and focused on how to shove the maximum amount of nutrients possible into the muscle. The goal was to achieve a level of nutrient uptake above and beyond what you would normally be able to do without exogenous insulin. One thing I started to notice a lot (and is even more prevalent today) is poor advice on insulin usage. This is the reason why 90% of bodybuilders who try insulin just get fatter and don't get much out of it. The reason is, there are so many coaches who give their clients an arbitrary amount of insulin to use, and then concoct a dextrose, maltodextrin, highly branched cyclic dextrin, or other fast digesting carbohydrate shake with some EAA’s or Hydrolyzed Whey mixed in and tell them to drink it with the insulin shot to “shuttle the nutrients” and build huge amounts of muscle. Reverse Engineering The Purpose Of Insulin Use If you actually reverse engineer how insulin works in the body you will see that when you eat carbohydrates, your blood sugar goes up accordingly, and your pancreas responds by releasing insulin in order to bring your blood sugar down. This is why diabetics who have burnt out beta cells and don't have a functioning regulator of insulin secretion have to manually inject insulin to complete that same function that non-diabetics endogenously have naturally. The purpose of the insulin is to bring your blood sugar down in accordance with your current diet. Insulin Protocols In Bodybuilding A very common scenario is a bodybuilder eating a calorie surplus trying to grow, and then their coach telling them something like, “Here, use 8 iu’s of Humalog and then drink this pre-workout”. Does that actually make logical sense when you think about it? The whole point of insulin is to bring your blood sugar back to homeostasis, not to add calories that are just above and beyond what your body needs to be glycogen loaded. If you're in a caloric surplus because you're trying to gain muscle, the chances of you being glycogen depleted totally to zero from your workout are slim to none unless you're a hardcore endurance athlete doing cycling, competing in Ironman Triathlons, or something similar. Diabetics use insulin around their diet. For example – How would a diabetic individual who eats three meals a day that have 75 grams of carbs in each use insulin? Their insulin would be used in accordance with those 75 grams of carbs per meal at a dosage that would bring their blood sugar down to healthy levels. The dosage used would be entirely dependent on what dosage of insulin is necessary to bring their blood sugar back to healthy levels, and not based on some arbitrary amount of insulin in a predetermined protocol. Diabetics use their insulin based on what they consume, and how much insulin they will need to regulate their blood sugar in response to that food intake. You will often find bodybuilders framing their insulin usage on the complete opposite. Believe it or not, it’s actually common for misinformed bodybuilders to end up eating more than they need to, often literally slamming straight sugar or other liquid based carbs with a fast gastric emptying time with EAA’s, and then injecting random amounts of insulin for no reason whatsoever to “shuttle the nutrients” to the muscle, and then being puzzled when they just end up gaining fat. What A Smarter Insulin Protocol Would Look Like In A Bodybuilding Context Practical application of insulin would be dosed accordingly around your carbohydrate intake that you currently eat in order to gain muscle. NOT your diet plus a bunch of arbitrary amounts of sugar to prevent you from going hypoglycemic from a predetermined insulin dosage Here are 2 examples, one being a logical insulin protocol, and one being an illogical one (the illogical one is actually more common among bodybuilders). Logical Insulin Use: For breakfast (or any other meal), whatever amount of carbs is in the breakfast would then determine the appropriate insulin dosage to offset the blood sugar increase from that meal. The insulin dosage would also be dependent on the type of insulin used, and the individual’s insulin sensitivity/blood sugar. The 10 grams of carbs per IU of insulin rule commonly found on forums is not something to adhere to, and is about as logical as time on = time off for steroid cycles. You might need a lot more, or you might need a lot less, it all depends on your body. This would all be regulated and determined by strictly monitoring your blood sugar levels throughout the day with a glucose monitor. Illogical Insulin Use: Randomly injecting 7 iu’s of Humalog for no reason pre-workout and then drinking 70 grams of Vitargo with EAA’s to “shuttle nutrients” in the middle of your workout. Bodybuilding Coach/Guru Red Flags I'm not a coach and I'm not trying to give advice here necessarily, I'm just trying to tell you what to red flags to steer clear of if you see it in a coaching plan. If your diet already has you taking in a surplus of calories to gain muscle every day and your coach tells you to add a random predetermined insulin shot with a predetermined shake on top of that diet, inquire as to what it's going to accomplish when you're already in the surplus of calories and the carbohydrates in all of your other meals are being unaccounted for. Why is the insulin not being worked around the diet that's comprised of more than enough carbs than you already need to grow? Why are there shakes being added on top of your calorie surplus? They are unnecessary and will just spill over into unnecessary fat gain. Keep in mind how diabetics use insulin and relate it to your personal needs if you're using it for bodybuilding purposes. To clarify, I’m not a coach or a doctor, and I have no official credentials whatsoever to tell anyone about how to use insulin properly. I'm just speaking from experience and years of research, and trying to steer you clear of what not to do when it comes to insulin. The goal of this article is to avert a potential scenario where you just gain fat trying to get jacked using some predetermined insulin protocol your coach made for you, or you found online on a forum that doesn’t take into account your macronutrient intake or insulin sensitivity whatsoever.

    "title": "Accutane Review – How I Got Rid Of My Acne Permanently",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/accutane-review/",
    "date": "2019-03-28T16:00:30+00:00",
    "content": "Accutane Review – How I Got Rid Of My Acne Permanently     What Is Accutane? Accutane is a brand name for the drug Isotretinoin. This drug became extremely popular (and remains to this day) for its overall efficacy in getting rid of acne, and preventing it from coming back. When I was a teenager I had really bad acne. It was pretty bad on my face, but it was really bad on my back and my body, even before touching any anabolics. I literally had cystic acne on my back that was so bad to the extent where if I did a squat without the pad on the bar I would be bleeding by the end of the set because of the acne getting crushed on the top of my back. I ended up getting a prescription of Accutane for 6 months. My dosage was 80 mg per day. If you get a prescription for Accutane in the first place your dermatologist has determined that your case is bad enough that it justifies using Accutane, because it's not a no-risk drug. Typically, dermatologists won’t prescribe Accutane until you’ve tried all other treatments, or your acne is extremely severe.  Accutane Mechanism Of Action Accutane works by decreasing the size and sebum output of the sebaceous glands. I’m sure you’ve noticed if you don’t shower for several days or wash your face that your scalp and skin start to get a greasy, oily gross texture. This is sebum secretion that hasn’t been rinsed off. Accutane permanently reduces the amount of this grease that gets produced. The benefit of this is hair follicles no longer get plugged with oil causing acne. Prevalence Of Accutane Side Effects I was pretty ignorant to the extreme side effects mentioned intermittently on the internet, and I more than anything just wanted to get rid of my acne. When it comes to the prevalence of Accutane side effects, I’ve come to see them similar to the prevalence of Finasteride related side effects. In sheer quantity, there have been a significant amount of reported extreme cases of negative side effects with Accutane usage. However, relative to the total number of users, that giant quantity is relatively small. The same goes for Finasteride. The majority of individuals experience no side effects, but you will always have a subsection of users who experience horrible life altering side effects. Fortunately, with Finasteride these can more often than not be completely reversed, but with Accutane, as the mechanism is less clear and it has a permanent effect on the body, the side effects are less manageable. The majority of side effects stem from the drop in sebum levels in the body, but there are some other very odd side effects that are reported in a very small percentage of users. Knowing what I know now, would I still use Accutane if I went back in time and had to relive the chances of getting rid of my acne vs experiencing those side effects? In a heart beat. My Accutane Review The only side effect I experienced from Accutane was the same side effects you’d expect from a permanent reduction of oil in the body. It made my skin drier and my lips chapped. On Accutane I had really chapped lips all the time and my skin went from very oily and greasy looking to flaky and dry. After my Accutane cycle finished, the reduction of oil in my body maintained itself to a large extent, but the intense dryness in my lips and skin did improve. Basically, it got rid of enough oil to eliminate the occurrence of acne, but not so much that I need to apply chapstick several times per day or anything crazy like when I was on the drug. I still need to use moisturizer on my face, and I have a permanent reduction in oil, which I'm totally okay with because it's what prevents me from getting acne. To this day (almost a decade later) I still have not experienced a relapse of acne in any capacity, even when using high dosages of anabolic steroids. I used to have full-blown disgusting cystic acne all over my shoulders and all over my back to the point where I couldn't even wear a sleeveless shirt to the gym because I just looked gross. Acne kills your confidence, it makes you feel like crap and it doesn't look good obviously. Out of every drug I’ve ever taken in my life (and you guys who follow my content know I’ve taken a f*cking ton of different drugs), Accutane was bar none the most life-changing drug. I went from being a train wreck of acne; to literally having none whatsoever, even if I blasted a heavy cycle of steroids. Do I recommend Accutane? That’s not a decision for me to make. Take my experience with a grain of salt. I think Accutane is a great drug, but just like any other drug on this planet there's a small chance you could have a terrible reaction to it. I’m sure every single person reading this has taken Tylonel before, and there’s a minuscule chance you could have spiked Steven Johnson syndrome via an extreme autoimmune response where your skin starts blistering and peeling off. There are a handful of rare and scary side effects for every single drug out there. Just keep that in mind. I’ve been asked several times how I prevented myself from getting acne on supraphysiological dosages of anabolics, and that’s literally all I did to get rid of it permanently. I tried all of the Proactiv products, as well as all of the other notable topicals. I even used to boil a giant bowl of water and then stick my face over it and hang a towel over my head to replicate a steam room to open up my pores so I could wash the oil and dead skin cells out of them to try and get rid of my acne. None of it had more than a negligible effect. Prior to actually using Accutane I tried every popular method known at the time, and the only thing left for me to try was the drug. If you are experiencing horrendous acne and nothing is working, it might be worthwhile to make an appointment with a dermatologist, get a blood panel done to check if your liver enzymes and blood markers are all in check, and discuss if Accutane is the right option for you.

    "content": "How To Increase Your Penis Size Without Pumps, Stretchers, Or Manual Exercises     Losing Fat To Increase Your Penis Size The only way to increase your penis size without pumps, stretchers, or manual exercises is by getting shredded. When you want add new permanent size, a consistent jelqing and stretching regimen in conjunction with the Bathmate pump and a good extender to prevent turtling are the gold standard and will net you 2-3 inches in length and girth if you are religious about your routine.  However, that is new size, and has nothing to do with the penis length hidden in your fat pad that you might be selling yourself short on.  Fat Pad And Inner Penis Right above your penis you have something called a “fat pad”. This is basically just a layer of fat that covers your inner penis. If you push this area inwards, you'll notice that more of your penis becomes revealed than would have been otherwise. This is your inner penis. Your penis actually extends into your body another few inches, and the majority of that is covered by subcutaneous fat tissue. The fatter you are, the more of this inner penis is covered, and the more length you are selling yourself short on. You can easily increase your penis size by half an inch just by getting shredded. For every inch you lose off your waist, your dick will measure .05″ to .10″ longer. Most guys are too high of a body fat percentage and have some fat pad to work with and would benefit in more ways than they imagine just by getting lean. Improve your physique and get healthier, all while simultaneously increasing your penis size. Bone Pressed Erect Length (BPEL) Vs Non-Bone Pressed Erect Length (NBPEL) Take a ruler and place it on top of your dick. That is your NBPEL measurement. Push that ruler into your body right above your dick. That is your BPEL measurement. Every guy’s bone pressed length is typically a fair bit longer than his non-bone pressed length. The reason for that is because there's that layer of fat between the amount you are bone pressing when you push the ruler into your pelvis, and the amount of fat sitting there covering your inner penis when you’re measuring non-bone pressed length. The amount of inner penis hidden is entirely dependent on how fat you are. The less fat on your body, the longer your penis will be. If you don’t want to commit to a time consuming PE regimen, getting lean is a great and easy alternative (or additive if you do both). Fat Pad Vs Abdominal Fat Analogy Relating the “inner penis” to something more widely known and accepted can be done with abs. Abs are exactly the same. Your abs are always there. Every single guy has a six-pack. However, the vast majority of men can’t see their six-pack because a giant layer of fat covers it. When that fat is stripped off via diet and exercise, their abs become visible. The more fat you burn, the more your abs will pop. Your penis works the same way. The easiest way to increase your penis size without pumps, stretchers, or manual exercises, by upwards of half of an inch in a short time frame is literally just getting shredded.

When bodybuilders refer to Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) dosages they’ll often state that 200 milligrams is a therapeutic dosage. This is typically not a therapeutic dosage at all, and is more like a small supraphysiological cycle being used year round. A therapeutic dosage of Testosterone is a dosage that would bring serum Total and Free Testosterone levels in the blood up to what you would produce naturally if you weren’t hypogonadal. Delving into the clinical data, we can see that the true milligram equivalent is actually far less than that. Before delving in deeper, keep in mind that ester weight and the milligram amount per milliliter stated on the vial of your prescription doesn't necessarily equate to how many milligrams of Testosterone per milliliter your product truly contains. Let me elaborate on that. How Many Milligrams Of Testosterone Do Men Naturally Produce? Testosterone is the principal circulating androgen. In men, it is secreted primarily by the Leydig cells in the testes at a daily production of about 6-7 mg [R]. Other clinical data corroborates this as well. A more broad and accurate range is 3-10 mg per day [R], but in general, the average daily production is approximately 6-7 mg per day in healthy men. The difference between 3 mg per day and 10 mg per day is massive, as you would logically conclude. However, this is not reflected in the “therapeutic” reference ranges you will see in your blood work. The “Healthy” Testosterone Reference Range Depending on the lab, the “healthy” range of natural Testosterone production could be as low as 240 ng/dL on the bottom, and 1000 ng/dL on the high end. Some labs are even worse. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize that a Testosterone level 4x higher will not equate to the same quality of life, muscle building potential, etc. However, 90% of doctors still are so far behind the curve that they truly believe that a 250 ng/dL Testosterone level is just as good as a 1000 ng/dL Testosterone level. Weekly Testosterone Production In Milligrams Based on the daily average production in milligrams, we can calculate that weekly the average healthy male produces between 42 to 49 mg per week. A ton of men using 200 mg per week probably think that number is far too low and isn’t accurate. However, what a lot of guys don't consider is that the ester itself takes up a significant portion of the milligram content per milliliter. After administering Testosterone, your body has to cleave the ester from the molecule to free up the Testosterone to actually be bioavailable in the body, and that ester accounts for a significant portion of that milligram/milliliter amount. The only exception to this is Testosterone Base and Testosterone Suspension, which are just straight up Testosterone products with no ester attached, but you would never get a prescription for that as the half-life is so short it would require multiple administrations per day. Testosterone Cypionate Ester Weight The Cypionate ester has a high molecular weight and accounts for 30% of the milligram total stated on a TRT prescription. For example, if your TRT prescription was 200 mg of Testosterone Cypionate every week, despite the vial being labeled as 200 mg/ml, the Cypionate ester’s molecular weight takes up 30% of that mg content, and cleaving the ester from the Testosterone molecule in the body leaves only 140 mg/ml, which is 70% of the stated label dosage. What Dosage Of Testosterone Do You Really Need For Therapeutic TRT? There are vastly different perspectives on hormone levels in the TRT community and the bodybuilding community. There are many men (mostly bodybuilders) who believe that 200 mg per week is the bare minimum for high-end TRT, and dosages of 250 mg or even 300 mg per week are justified as within the realm of natural production still. There are doctors who will corroborate this too, which to me is pretty baffling. Very, very seldom does somebody actually need 200 mg a week to maintain the equivalent of healthy endogenous production. Usually, those guys are essentially running a cycle year-round. This is something I’ve been saying for a while now, as I used to actually believe that 200 mg per week was therapeutic (until I started really monitoring my blood work closely). Micro-Dosing TRT To Maintain Stable Blood Serum Concentrations My TRT is currently 125 mg per week, and even that is pushing into supraphysiological territory when you actually split that shot into seven micro shots to keep more stable blood serum concentrations. Splitting a large dosage/administration of 125 mg per week into 7 administrations/micro-doses of 18 mg per day increases Free Testosterone more relative to a large weekly dosage, decreases the amount of aromatization to Estrogen occurring in the body, and maintains more stable Testosterone blood serum concentrations. Often times, doctors will prescribe their patients 100 – 200 mg of Testosterone Cypionate every 7-10 days, and then advise them to administer it in one giant dosage once per week, or even once every 2 weeks. This is insane and reflects on how completely inept the majority of physicians are when it comes to hormone management. When you administer yourself with a large dosage at once, you spike your Testosterone levels to supraphysiological levels, often 2x or even 3x as high as they should be for a few days, which obviously has an equivalent amount of aromatization occurring in parallel to this. Following this, levels slowly crash down as hormone levels decline in the body, and often times patients will fall back down to the low end of the reference range while waiting for their next shot.  The end result is a constant roller coaster of fluctuating Testosterone levels going from way too high, to way too low, over and over again, with far too much Estrogen aromatization occurring, resulting in completely unnecessary side effects. These side effects often then need to be mitigated with an Aromatase Inhibitor, which doctors know even less about how to prescribe and mange correctly, and will often crash their patient’s E2 levels into the ground and leave them feeling like complete trash and ruining their lipids. AI’s are not something you want to be on long term as they are not healthy, and E2 management can be done via lifestyle and diet changes more often than not in the context of therapeutic TRT. High Dose TRT Vs Low Dose TRT There are constant arguments about what the optimal replacement dose of Testosterone is. There's a small camp of guys who believe that 10 milligrams of Testosterone Propionate per day is ideal for most men, and I'm inclined to agree with them far more than the guys who believe that dosages as high as 200 mg per week are necessary. This will of course vary depending on a variety of factors, but typically 10 mg of Testosterone Propionate per day will put an individual at top end of the Testosterone therapeutic range. I find that when men talk about ideal dosages being closer to 125 – 150 – 200 mg per week, the ester weight often isn't taken into account (Cypionate, Enanthate, Propionate, etc. all have different molecular weights), and they are often individuals who administer large dosages at once, let their levels spike way above the therapeutic limit up to supraphysiological levels for a few days, and slowly crash underneath that until their next shot. If you get your blood drawn during a trough and the results show that you have a 850 ng/dL Testosterone level, you may not be accounting for the fact that right after you administered your fat weekly (or even bi-weekly) dosage, your levels probably skyrocketed upwards of 1500 ng/dL. I found this statistic very interesting as 50 milligrams a week really is not much whatsoever in contrast to what most guys are injecting weekly believing they are just “replacing” their natural production. Bodybuilders Maintaining Muscle On Only 200 mg Of Testosterone There are a lot of massive bodybuilders, including IFBB pros, who maintain massive physiques in the off-season and in retirement with just 200 mg of Testosterone per week. They're able to maintain physiques that are blatantly not maintainable naturally. If top bodybuilders who are pros at 240 pounds plus are maintaining those physiques with just 200 mg per week, its pretty transparent that the 200 mg per week dosage is actually more than the therapeutic amount in most situations, and the clinical data backs this up. Personally, I used to believe I needed 200 mg per week to maintain my physique, and I was SO wrong. 200 mg per week for most individuals is the equivalent of running a cycle year round, and certainly is not therapeutic in any capacity. There are caveats to this, with SHBG, ester choice, body composition, diet, lifestyle factors, and many other things playing a significant role in how much Testosterone actually becomes usable in the body, consequently influencing how large of a dosage an individual would need to achieve healthy Free Testosterone levels. But in general, true therapeutic TRT would be as simple as replicating the natural daily production of 6-7 mg with an exogenous source after factoring in the ester weight. P.S. I do all of my daily TRT injections with an insulin pin now in my glutes and ventro glutes. With such a low volume of daily oil, it’s something I can get away with daily without creating a lump of oil that doesn’t absorb properly, which would occur if you tried to jab a large amount of oil too shallowly with a short needle. No more harpoons for me.

One of the first questions many have regarding SARMs is “Do SARMs cause hair loss?”  All SARMs can cause hair loss. The extent to which they can cause it is based upon their own inherent tissue selectivity and androgenicity. There is no SARM as of now that is completely selective for anabolic to androgenic activity in the body. All SARMs Can Be Androgenic Some dosage for every SARM no matter which it is will induce prostate growth, which in turn will likely have an effect on the hair follicles on your head, facial hair growth, and other virilization side effects. Typically, if somebody starts losing hair on SARMs it is the result of telogen effluvium, or using a high dosage of SARM way beyond what the probable therapeutic dosage would be established at. How SARMs Can Prevent Hair Loss While SARMs can cause hair loss, they can also prevent hair loss. At least in theory they can prevent hair loss, as there is no clinical study to assess this specifically. Anecdotally, if you reverse engineer how SARMs work you can see how they're going to play out in a hair loss prevention context. I personally know a few individuals who actually do this for their hair loss prevention protocols in conjunction with oral Estradiol to maintain healthy E2 levels. SARMs were created to replace the therapeutic anabolic benefits of testosterone on muscle tissue and bone. The dosage at which many SARMs in clinical development fulfill and hit that threshold of therapeutic activity not only suppress the endogenous production of testosterone, but they compete with Testosterone and DHT for the androgen receptor (AR). By suppressing systemic Testosterone levels in the body and competing with Testosterone and DHT for the androgen receptor, androgenic activity in the body is substantially decreased. This reduces prostate size and can potentially also reduce hair loss. How SARMs Suppress Testosterone Levels SARMs suppress the endogenous production of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, which in turn lowers natural testosterone production. The result of this is a suppression of the endogenous androgens that progress androgenic alopecia. How SARMs Compete With Testosterone And DHT SARMs were designed to have a very strong binding affinity. Hundreds of SARMs have been synthesized over the years. Some have a much higher binding affinity than others. Throughout the years, a handful of SARMs have been developed that exhibit a binding affinity superior to Testosterone, and formidable to DHT. When a SARM with a high binding affinity enters the body and starts occupying androgen receptors, there will be less vacant androgen receptors for Testosterone and DHT to bind to. If Testosterone and DHT cannot bind to the androgen receptor, they cannot mediate their anabolic and androgenic effects in the body. Preclinical models have proven that SARMs can antagonize the androgenic effects of Testosterone by competing for androgen receptor binding, while concurrently enhancing the overall anabolic effects in muscle tissue. Essentially, when an efficacious SARM is introduced into the body, it binds to androgen receptors with a formidable or greater affinity than the body’s natural endogenous androgens (Testosterone and DHT), and then facilitates its tissue selective anabolic effects, which ultimately prevents many of the negative androgenic side effects of Testosterone and DHT (because they are being outperformed by the SARM in binding affinity), while simultaneously inducing maximal anabolic activity in muscle tissue and bone. This is exhibited in a preclinical rodent model conducted using Testosterone Propionate and RAD140. In the study, Testosterone on its own built less muscle and induced more androgenic activity than the same dosage of Testosterone did with RAD140 [R]. In a sense, SARMs act similarly to systemic antiandrogens, except they won’t destroy the body because they mediate their own anabolic effects in muscle and bone as effectively as Testosterone, while sparing androgen-affected tissues of any significant stimulation. In the near future, I'm sure we can expect to see increasingly effective SARMs with stronger binding affinities and even better tissue selectivity. SARMs Vs Finasteride Efficacy For Hair Loss Prevention This is where SARMs get even more interesting in a hair loss prevention context. S1 was one of the first SARMs ever synthesized. It was abandoned in preclinical trials because it was not nearly as effective as some of the newer SARMs that are in stage 2 clinical trials now like LGD-4033 and Ostarine. A preclinical rodent model assessed how effective S1 is at suppressing benign prostatic hyperplasia compared to Finasteride [R]. Finasteride was created for this exact purpose (reducing prostate size), but the makers of the drug figured out that suppressing DHT levels indirectly also reduces hair loss. Off-label it was prescribed for hair loss prevention as well, and then eventually Propecia was created, which is the official brand name of Finasteride prescribed for hair loss prevention. Hair loss prevention with Finasteride is indirectly caused by a suppression of endogenous androgens via dropping DHT, which ultimately lowers prostate size. S1 was compared to Finasteride and Hydroxyflutamide in this study. At all dosages tested S1 outperformed Finasteride in efficacy measures.  Not only did S1 reduce prostate size more than Finasteride (which decreases hair loss miniaturization), it also induced a greater amount of anabolic activity than Finasteride. This means that S1 could sustain the physiological functions fulfilled by Testosterone in muscle tissue and bone with a lower androgen load on the body, and theoretically less hair loss. Keep in mind that S1 is a first generation SARM, and more efficacious SARMs were discovered thereafter, which is why it was eventually abandoned. Some of the newer stronger SARMs would perform even more favorably than S1 did in the same context. SARMs Usage In Humans To Prevent Hair Loss? The more tissue selective of a compound used on a research subject, the more efficacious it is for potential hair loss prevention. Let's just say you have a SARM with 500 to 1 anabolic to androgenic ratio of selectivity and a very high binding affinity. Testosterone’s anabolic to androgenic ratio is 1 to 1. With the SARM, you could theoretically keep muscle tissue and bone maintenance at therapeutic levels while simultaneously nuking testosterone and DHT via the suppression of natural testosterone level in the body. The SARM would also occupy androgen receptors with a greater affinity than Testosterone and DHT, which would prevent AR mediated androgenic activity to a large extent. Concurrently while those two things are happening, you indirectly reduce hair follicle miniaturization. Lower androgen index = decreased prostate size = decreased hair loss. Reverse Engineering Androgenic Activity In The Body On the opposite side of the spectrum, if you administered Proviron, Drostanolone, or literal DHT you would undoubtedly increase your prostate size, increase facial hair growth, increase body hair growth, and increase hair loss. This is well known and accepted. It is only logical that the exact opposite of injecting powerful androgens (lowering androgen activity at the AR) would have an exact opposite effect on the prostate and hair follicles as well. The goal is having as low of an androgen load while still fulfilling maximal anabolic functions in the body. SARMs Cannot Be Used For HRT Without Estrogen SARMs do not aromatize into Estrogen. This is the inherent flaw of SARMs and is one of the main reasons why they will be disqualified as an effective hormone replacement therapy alternative. When you suppress endogenous Testosterone and DHT significantly with high dosages of SARMs or long-term usage, you will also severely inhibit the production of the Testosterone, which is the hormone that aromatizes into Estrogen in the male body. Estrogen is necessary for mediating healthy hair growth. There are theories thrown around the internet that chronically elevated Estrogen levels cause hair loss. By referring to the hormone profile of a healthy women (the gender that keeps their hair), we can clearly see that they have high Estrogen levels, Progesterone levels nearly equivalent to men two-thirds of the year (the full year with some forms of birth control), and low Testosterone/DHT levels. On the other side of the spectrum, men have just enough Estrogen to fulfill physiological functions, nearly identical Progesterone levels to women the majority of the year, and high Testosterone/DHT levels.    Once you suppress Testosterone endogenously with a SARM, you eventually crush estrogen into the ground in parallel to your Testosterone and DHT being suppressed. The only remedy for this would be oral or topical Estrogen administration to bring systemic Estrogen levels back up to where they should be. In the context of male hormone replacement therapy, a doctor telling a guy to literally ingest Estrogen pills to bring their E2 levels up to where they should be is so far out of the realm of possibility, let alone SARMs making it into the context of a real HRT alternative prescription. 99% of doctors still don’t even understand how to properly prescribe TRT and safely optimize naturally occurring bioidentical hormones, so expecting them to understand and accept something this new and odd probably wouldn’t ever occur. Future Alternatives To Traditional Hormone Replacement Therapy I'm not advising anyone to do this, and this is all hypothetical. I'm just talking about things I've noticed and that I find interesting in the space in terms of how things work in the body. SARMs will inevitably greatly suppress Testosterone and DHT, as well as compete for androgen receptor activation, which may help prevent hair loss based on the clinical data. Of course, this is all dependent on multiple factors, including if a mega dose of the SARM is being used or if it’s being used “therapeutic” amounts. And then concurrent Estrogen administration to keep Estrogen levels where they should be would also be factored in. This could all hypothetically drop androgen index in the body to a level that sustains a lack of hair loss miniaturization, mediates healthy hair growth with adequate estrogen levels, and simultaneously maintains adequate anabolic activity in the body with a lack of stimulation in androgen sensitive tissues. I'm not sure why there weren’t more studies conducted on this specifically because it looks like a really promising area. The S1 study in particular I have referenced before, and the data comparing other SARMs to Finasteride is even more promising. As the scope broadens in terms of selective androgen receptor modulators and their potential therapeutic applications, I believe they will start being looked at in this potential context as well. I see great potential in it, and I've seen a handful of real-world examples of people who have replicated this theory in their personal studies. At the end of the day, hair loss in most cases boils down to what androgens are in the body, their binding affinity, their tissue selectivity, how they transcribe their effects and activate androgen receptors, their inherent androgenicity, and the total serum concentrations of them in the body. Even if you have a very selective anabolic agent in the body (like a SARM), if a huge amount of it was circulating around, that could still be more than enough to induce prostate growth and hair loss. Therefore, the answer to the question “do SARMs cause hair loss” is both yes and no.

The first thing I want to make clear in regards to my Dutasteride and Testosterone experiment is that DHT is the worst hormone in your body for your hair. I don’t want anyone to misinterpret my videos and articles exhibiting the androgenicity of Testosterone as disregarding how bad DHT is. DHT is terrible for hair loss. It is several-fold more androgenic than Testosterone. I think I made that pretty clear in my content, but just to clarify before we delve into this. DHT still needs to be addressed. The whole point of my article and video addressing Testosterone’s androgenicity was to state that endogenous androgens as a whole need to be addressed, NOT just the DHT.  Using Dutasteride With TRT To Prevent Hair Loss It came to my attention that there was a thread made referring to my first video addressing Testosterone’s inherent ability to cause hair loss, and how they believe that Dutasteride in conjunction with TRT is the way to maintain “DHT fulfilled” physiological functions, as well as completely prevent hair loss. I had the same theory a couple years ago. The person who started that thread was essentially proposing what I believed in 2017. Back in 2017 I thought to myself okay; if you use Dutasteride you're guaranteed to be protected from hair loss from Testosterone because the 5-alpha reduction to DHT is taken care of. I realized some very crucial things shortly thereafter. Finasteride Is A Band-Aid While using Finasteride, you can reduce systemic DHT by roughly 70%, but you will still have 30% of your systemic DHT left in tact, which is still going to wreak havoc on your hair (common knowledge). This also is irrelevant to Finasteride’s 41% reduction of scalp DHT in particular, but that’s an entire topic in itself [R]. Finasteride is a bandaid at most, but most guys know that. All you’re doing with Finasteride is putting your ticking time bomb of hair loss in slow motion. For many guys this is more than sufficient to stave off horrible hair loss for another several decades, but the fact remains that androgenic alopecia still occurs, albeit much slower while on Finasteride. The Reason Why Dutasteride Is Also A Band-Aid My blood work indicated near 100% suppression of my systemic DHT while on 1 mg of Dutasteride per day. The blood work couldn't even read my DHT because it was below the detection limit. Even with a supraphysiological amount of Testosterone in my system from administering an exogenous a source of it and pushing my Testosterone up to 2,000 ng/dL (on purpose) I still had nearly zero DHT in my system because Dutasteride is just that effective at inhibiting 5-alpha reductase. After determining that 5-alpha reductase inhibition is the same regardless of how much Testosterone is present, I hypothesized that if I just crushed my DHT to zero it would be the equivalent of castration, and then I could just fulfill the physiological anabolic properties that I would normally get from androgens via Testosterone administration. This opened up the possibility to simply increasing exogenous Testosterone usage to whatever dosage would be necessary to fulfill whatever potential androgenic disparity there would be in the body with a complete lack of DHT. Based on my blood work, Dutasteride still inhibited Testosterone conversion enough to the point where I could hypothetically use unlimited amounts of Testosterone and still inhibit 5-alpha reduction into DHT completely. I thought okay great, so I can just use more Testosterone and keep all of my hair because DHT is still absent regardless of how much my Testosterone goes up. But that just wasn't the case. Even once I accomplished DHT inhibition, I had continuous androgenic side effects just from testosterone. The entirety of the experiment I had zero DHT, but I still experienced facial hair growth and had to shave my face just as often. I still experienced body hair growth, and despite it somewhat notably being reduced on my lower back area, I still had to manscape once a week to keep my body hair growth under control in general. These are things I had to do anyways just as frequently before when I had normal amounts of DHT in my body. I still had significant androgenic activity in my body, even with 0 DHT present, because Dutasteride does absolutely nothing to protect hair follicles from Testosterone, and actually increases scalp concentrations of Testosterone, which is why a minority of men who are especially sensitive to Testosterone actually experience exacerbated hair loss and what is often perceived to be chronic telogen effluvium while on Dutasteride. With this being said, Dutasteride will massively slow down hair loss in the majority of individuals, but it still doesn’t address the true root of the issue, and is not a solution for many. How Prostate Size Correlates With Hair Loss The first thing that I think needs to be taken into consideration that's largely overlooked is the fact that Finasteride and Dutasteride were created to address prostate size. The intention of the drug was not to address hair loss, the creators simply realized that a fringe benefit of inhibiting prostate growth by systemically inhibiting DHT conversion is that your hair can grow back because there's less androgen induced miniaturization occurring. If you reference the clinical data on Testosterone itself, you can clearly see that it stimulates prostate growth itself inherently, just to a lesser extent than DHT [R]. Not relating to DHT conversion whatsoever, but on its own entirely. Ideally, for hair loss prevention you would want to have an anabolic in your body that fulfills all of the anabolic properties of Testosterone and simultaneously has as minimal of an androgenic effect as possible. This is typically assessed in preclinical animal models when analyzing the efficacy of possible hormone replacement therapy alternatives by comparing a drugs stimulation of muscle growth relative to the stimulation of prostate and seminal vesicles growth. The less favorable the myotrophic-to-androgenic ratio is of a drug, the less ideal of a hormone replacement therapy option it is for men seeking to minimize androgenic alopecia. In general, the more androgenic a hormone is, the more it will increase prostate size and cause hair loss. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the less androgenic a hormone is, the less it will stimulate prostate growth, and the less it will expedite androgenic alopecia. The Paradox Of Being A Male When It Comes To Hair Loss Prevention Lowering androgenic activity in the body is totally counterproductive to being a male, and presents the paradox men face with their endocrine system. If you're a male, just the fact that you're a male puts you in a position where your hormone profile is counterproductive to keeping hair on your head, and the hormone profile necessary for complete hair loss prevention is counterproductive to being a male. What I mean by that is you rely on endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids for libido, penile sensitivity, muscle growth, recovery, neuroprotective effects on the brain, maintenance of masculine traits, and many more functions or traits that are fulfilled directly by androgens or androgen receptor activation. What most guys don’t realize is that Testosterone itself is the sole reason you can even operate and function without any DHT in your system. The reason is literally because Testosterone is androgenic itself. At best, it has that two-to-one selectivity for muscle tissue to prostate, and many other studies indicate that a two-to-one ratio is extremely generous. That's great because it fulfills the androgenic properties that would otherwise be fulfilled by DHT. Hence why most guys can use Dutasteride with no side effects, and those that experience androgen deficient side effects simply have free-testosterone levels that are too low to fulfill that androgen deficit, or do not understand effective Estrogen/general hormone management. The side effects would predictably be mitigated with exogenous androgen administration, or Estrogen management in almost all cases, dependent on what the root of the issue was specifically. But, the problem with that is that by fulfilling those very androgen dependent physiological functions; you will also miniaturize hair follicles. This is the paradox of being a male. Maximizing libido, maximizing the sensitivity of the penis and maintaining masculine characteristics all must be achieved via sufficient androgen levels, which will also cause the miniaturization of hair follicles, and is exactly why Finasteride works so well. Finasteride directly reduces prostate size by inhibiting DHT, which the majority of the population has acknowledged is also what prevents progression of hair loss. If you look at androgen activity from the opposite side of the spectrum you will note that increased androgen levels in the body result in increased libido, increased penile sensitivity, increased facial hair growth, increased prostate size, and predictably, increased hair loss miniaturization. It doesn’t matter what androgenic hormone is in the body, whether its pure DHT, Drostanolone, Trenbolone, Anadrol, Dianabol, etc. they all have their own inherent androgenicity and impact on stimulating the prostate and seminal vesicles, as well as all other androgen affected tissues, including hair follicles. It's all directly correlated to one another. Transgender Male To Female Transition Hair Loss Reversal One study I was looking at recently was a study following the progress of a man who had a serum Testosterone level of 455 ng/dL and had already experienced significant male pattern baldness throughout his lifetime [R]. Men who decide to transition from male to female will often be prescribed an oral anti-androgen and oral estrogen. When he transitioned from male to female, he used oral estradiol and spironolactone. What did he accomplish with this? It dropped his serum Testosterone down to 11 ng/dL. The result of that was significant inhibition of facial hair and body hair growth. And, he also started re-growing scalp hair and reversing his male pattern baldness. This is not a coincidence, and is related entirely to their androgen index, and maintaining healthy levels of Estrogen in the absence of Testosterone that would normally aromatize into Estrogen. This is why some very hair loss prone individuals who truly value their hair more than their masculinity are using oral anti-androgens now in the hair loss community. This was actually one of the least impressive reversals I could reference, and the only reason I chose this one was because it is in PubMed and clearly states exactly what their hormone levels were before and after. There are a number of ways to tackle hair loss, with some targeting mechanisms downstream in the cascade of events that eventually lead to the miniaturization of the hair follicle (e.g. Prostaglandin Theory). While some are effective and are worth exploring for certain individuals (more on that in future articles), the root of the issue still derives from androgens. My Dutasteride Experiment And Why I Lost Hair On It Even with DHT crushed to zero, I experienced androgenic alopecia during the entirety of 2018. I used Dutasteride with Testosterone concurrently with nothing else for a full year. In my videos filmed in the middle of 2018 you can see that I had fairly substantial thinning in the middle of my Dutasteride experiment compared to my hair pre-Dutasteride usage.  (2018 – Dutasteride Only)  (2017 – No Dutasteride) I ran it for a year straight on just TRT. My libido was perfect. I had no erectile dysfunction whatsoever. Finasteride And Dutasteride Effect On Muscle Growth I didn't lose any muscle at all while using Dutasteride. It should be noted that Finasteride and Dutasteride have no effect on muscle growth whatsoever because 5-alpha reductase is only present in muscle tissue in small amounts [R].  Minimal conversion of Testosterone to DHT occurs in muscle tissue, and the entirety of the human body’s anabolic effects in muscle tissue are mediated by endogenous Testosterone, not DHT. My priorities have changed over the years as I stopped caring about bodybuilding as much and started caring more about my hair. I started to give 5-alpha reductase inhibitors more of a chance in my research and experiments. I used to think they were the devil but I started to research more and realize what the androgenic component of certain anabolics really accomplishes in the body and how it really plays out in the whole cascade of events leading to eventual hair loss progression. Dutasteride Does Not Protect Hair From Testosterone I would have kept using Dutasteride if it worked the way I predicted it was going to work in 2017 before the experiment, but it didn't inhibit my systemic Testosterone at all from inducing androgenic activity at the hair follicle. I self-administered a dosage that pushed my Testosterone levels up to about 2000 ng/dL on purpose. I already know I’m severely prone to hair loss at that dosage with no protection, and I had to test the true extent of Testosterone’s own androgenic activity with DHT totally taken care of to know for sure what was going on in the body and to confirm my suspicions. I didn't use a topical anti-androgen for the entire year because I didn't want to skew my experiment results and because I still thought that perhaps I was just experiencing a prolonged shedding phase, and once it concluded then massive regrowth would occur. It never did, and Testosterone’s lack of anabolic selectivity in the body was revealed and quite obvious once you take into account that my facial hair, body hair and hair loss was nearly unaltered in contrast to what a slightly lower level of Testosterone in my body with DHT present would induce. While Dutasteride and exogenous Testosterone therapy may be sufficient for many men in the short-term, ultimately hair loss will still be occurring, just at a less expedited rate than if DHT was present, and for those who are very sensitive to Testosterone, it may make things worse (e.g. what happened in my experiment). Now you might be asking yourself, what if you kept a normal Testosterone level and used Dutasteride, what would happen then? Well, there would be no point of using exogenous Testosterone in that situation, and the only purpose it truly serves is to offset androgen deficiency side effects that may occur in a minority of individuals who use Dutasteride. Dutasteride on its own will increase endogenous Testosterone levels by up to 26% [R]. For most men, this is sufficient enough to fulfill all of the androgenic functions typically facilitated by endogenous DHT, but for some, it is not, and that’s where exogenous Testosterone administration would come into play to push systemic Testosterone high enough to fill that void of androgenic activity, with a higher selectivity of anabolic activity relative to androgenic activity than DHT. Would the dosage needed for that minority of individuals be high enough to cause hair loss like it did in me? Depends on their sensitivity, as some men can’t even prevent hair loss with 0 DHT and their regular endogenous Testosterone levels. The reason is because they have no protection from Testosterone. One thing to note, if it wasn’t obvious, there is no scenario in which someone would need to take enough Testosterone to push their levels up to 2000 ng/dL on Dutasteride (well, at least 99% of the time, the caveat being Free Testosterone and SHBG issues that may occur). The only reason I did it was to truly establish Testosterone’s myotrophic-to-androgenic selectivity without DHT present for my future reference. Androgen deficient side effects on Dutasteride like erectile dysfunction should be alleviated in the vast majority of individuals with very basic Estrogen management, and Testosterone optimization still within the therapeutic reference range. Different Methods Of Preventing Hair Loss The insight I got out of my Dutasteride and Testosterone experiment was invaluable as I’ve heard far too many self-proclaimed experts for years during my initial research confidently propose misinformation stating that DHT is the only hormone in the body that matters when it comes to hair loss. It can be difficult to snap your brain out of thinking something that 99% of people believe is true. The most effective ways to truly prevent hair loss via the androgen pathway in general will involve at least one of the following mediums:  Topical inhibition of all androgens A combination of systemic inhibition of androgens as well as topical Complete systemic inhibition of androgens Male > Female Transitioning Via Hormone Replacement Therapy Hormone replacement therapy with suppressive anabolic agents that exhibit an extremely favorable level of selectivity for myotrophic-to-androgenic activity in conjunction with estrogen administration to make up for the lack of Testosterone aromatization no longer occurring  I don't have a recommendation for which way to go about it, or if you should go about it at all. However, I can definitively tell you that while it's not as androgenic as DHT, Testosterone still needs to be accounted for if you don’t want a Band-Aid solution and you have very aggressive hair loss. Genetic Anomalies And Outlier Theories There are some people that are not sensitive to Testosterone or DHT. There are some people with 5-alpha reductase defects that are also not sensitive to Testosterone. There are a variety of genetic anomalies that are extremely rare, but exist nonetheless and can provide near immunity to hair loss progression. I suspect this is a genetic variant, and while we can get hung up on what this variant is in their DNA, at the end of the day, for 90-99% of us, androgens are what matter and what we should concern ourselves with understanding inside out, because you will very likely not be changing your genetic code in this lifetime. There are a variety of interesting theories that have branched out attempting to make sense of hair loss in a context that explains why DHT isn’t the only factor at play here. While some of these hold weight in certain regards, they are totally irrelevant to androgenic alopecia most of the time, and focus entirely on temporary shedding misinterpreted as androgenic alopecia. This typically applies to alternative theories like chronically elevated estrogen, elevated prolactin, thyroid deficiencies, liver damage, etc. I have yet to see any of these guys who make these bold claims even get blood work to establish their own theories in practical application. Instead of actually assessing these theories themselves, they will typically extrapolate data out of a study and then try and design an entire theory around it, and then make a blanket statement stating that the cause of hair loss is definitively (insert random hormone/nutrient/mineral/wild guess here). If you've seen my other content, you already know that I get my blood work checked a lot. I get everything checked extensively several times per year because if something is causing my hair loss (or results in a real health concern), I want to know what it is. Fortunately, my bodybuilding pharmacology background has enabled me to know how to manually address those things prior to even experiencing hair loss. I already had my blood work checked consistently and I've been monitoring it for years. Throughout my bodybuilding endeavours in the past I’ve at one time or another experienced severe Prolactin elevation as well as severe Estrogen elevation because I used to use stupid amounts of AAS when I competed in competitions. I've literally manually adjusted all of these random values so many times and I can definitively tell you that none of them are the root of male pattern baldness. I've used Caber to drop my Prolactin. I've had my Prolactin artificially raised from androgens that caused it. I've kept in the middle just by not using those androgens, and manually managed it at other times when I was using those drugs. My Estrogen, same thing. I've been on 500 milligrams of Test with Dianabol in the past (among other heavily aromatizing compounds) and had absurdly out of range Estrogen levels because I was young, stupid and wasn't using an aromatase inhibitor (AI) to manage my hormones correctly. I had severely elevated estrogen yet still experienced male pattern baldness. I've crashed my estrogen to zero intentionally to dry out for competitions – still had a hair loss. Low estrogen can cause telogen effluvium (shedding, not androgenic alopecia) as well, which should be noted.  If you crush your estrogen into the ground with Letrozole or another AI, you're inhibiting a critical hormone that facilitates healthy hair growth, but not causing androgenic alopecia itself. Shedding is not the same as androgenic alopecia.  I had perfect Estrogen levels throughout the entirety of my Dutasteride experiment (and still do) – still experienced androgenic alopecia. My liver is perfect. I don't drink and I don't use methylated oral steroids anymore. Even when my liver enzymes weren’t in range when I cycled methylated orals like Dianabol and Superdrol several times years ago there was no difference in my androgenic alopecia progression. Chronic inflammation is another common health marker that's commonly brought up. I've had a high sensitivity C-reactive protein test many times now to assess my levels of systemic inflammation, and the tests can't even detect inflammation in my body. Even with undetectable levels of inflammation in my body I still experience male pattern baldness with a high androgen index present. At one time I abused the hell out of T3 because I wanted to stay leaner with less effort and thought I could just artificially enhance my metabolism (doesn’t work that way by the way, do not try this), so I intentionally kept myself in a state of hyperthyroidism. I've also been hypothyroid many times as a result of that after coming off of T3. Both caused shedding, but didn’t progress my androgenic alopecia. I've been in the sweet spot (where I am in right now) and I've been in that same sweet spot several times in the past. I get a comprehensive panel done several times per year including my free T3, T4, TSH, reverse T3, Thyroglobulin, Thyroglobulin antibodies and Thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Androgenic alopecia never let up until I addressed androgens, and to be clear, for 90-99% of men, the same will apply. The only time it wouldn’t apply is if someone was experiencing temporary shedding from a deficiency, hormone imbalance, autoimmune condition, disease, or an array of other possibilities that cause shedding, which should not to be confused with androgenic alopecia. From what I’ve seen, every random value that is hypothesized as a potential root of the issue I've at one time or another had it severely elevated, severely crashed, or in the perfect sweet spot like it is right now. Estrogen elevation is definitely not the cause of androgenic alopecia, and neither are any of the other random values I mentioned. Estrogen facilitates hair growth and has a protective effect on scalp hair follicles. This is evidenced time and again in women who have high Estrogen levels, Progesterone levels equivalent to men the majority of the year (1 ng/mL or under), and low androgen levels. If chronically high Estrogen was the cause of androgenic alopecia, then we’d all have full heads of hair and women would be bald. I can confidently say you need to address DHT and Testosterone. I encourage you to get your blood work checked so you can see what's going on at systemic level. SARMs Potential Role In Hair Loss Prevention One promising thing I see in the future are selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), which for some reason I don't see talked about in the community at all. If an individual gets to the point where their endogenous androgens are severely expediting their hair loss to the extent where it can’t be managed with topical anti-androgens, growth agonists, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, and other classic management strategies, the next step above and beyond that would typically either be using stronger topical anti-androgens, or systemically inhibiting the endogenous androgens causing their hair loss. While this can be accomplished via a variety of mechanisms involving the androgen receptor, one of the most promising ways to potentially facilitate this in my opinion would be by incorporating a less androgenic hormone (like a SARM) in conjunction with Estrogen for hormone replacement therapy. In theory (and in practical application for many researchers), this would fulfill the anabolic properties that their endogenous production of Testosterone would normally fulfill, with less of an androgenic hit to the body, and simultaneously suppress the androgenic hormones in the body responsible for hair loss. The Estrogen would be used to bring systemic Estrogen levels up to where they should be in the absence of adequate Testosterone to Estrogen aromatization. While SARMs have been examined in preclinical rodent models in the context of their efficacy profiles for managing benign prostate hyperplasia, the effect they have on endogenous anabolic and androgenic activity can be reverse engineered to see its blatant potential in hair loss prevention [R]. In preclinical models, even one of the earliest and least effective SARMs showed a greater efficacy profile than Finasteride [R]. LGD-4033, BMS-564,929 and Ostarine are all in human clinical trials right now with impressive efficacy profiles, and I believe it is just a matter of time before SARMs, and other more selective anabolic agents in general start to be looked at very seriously. When it comes to hair loss prevention, the ratio of selectivity of the anabolic agents in the body is critical. The tradeoff there is that the lower the androgenic stimulation is in the body, the less sexual sensitivity there will be too, but that's just the paradox of being a male. The more of an androgen load you have, the more hair follicle miniaturization you have. Drugs like Proviron and Masteron are androgenic steroids men commonly use for muscle hardening during bodybuilding competitions, but less commonly known is that they are also drugs men use to increase their sex drive and increase their penile sensitivity. These drugs are extremely androgenic and do an amazing job at boosting libido. But, predictably, they are two of the absolute worst drugs for prostate growth and hair loss potential.

    "content": "Food Is The Most Anabolic Part Of Any Steroid Cycle     Food Is More Important Than Your Steroid Cycle In Bodybuilding Over-analyzing drug combinations and steroid cycle protocols in general is something I see on a daily basis. I receive a lot of messages over email, comments on my blog, DM’s on Instagram, Facebook messages, etc. More often than not, when the question is bodybuilding related, the question will be something along the lines of “what do you think of (insert drug name here) with (insert drug name here) for a (bulk/cut/recomp)? Thoughts?” I have literally been asked a question like this over a thousand times now. The amount of times I have been asked about optimizing diet to provide maximum growth and allow adequate recovery to actually make use of those compounds, is outnumbered by a drug related question by 20:1 at least (probably underestimating). Drugs are the overwhelming priority nowadays, and the framework of actually fueling the body adequately often goes severely overlooked. Now, don’t get me wrong, setting up a good protocol is important. Having your protocol in place and using something that's going to complement what you're trying to accomplish is high on the priority list. But, at the end of the day there are so many guys who are missing the bigger picture, and that's the diet portion of bodybuilding. If you're not eating enough protein, if you're not training hard enough, if you’re not resting enough, if you’re not sleeping enough, if you’re not staying insulin sensitive via diet, if you're not eating enough food in general, you're not going to grow regardless if you're on a gram of Trenbolone, and that's literally the truth. You could go take a gram of Tren per day, but if you are only eating 1500 calories per day you’re not going to grow, period. When pro bodybuilders made the majority of their progress and were growing like weeds, they weren’t sitting on their computer writing out a billion different steroid combinations, or trying to figure out which compound is going to achieve the ultimate level of synergy with everything else they are using. They take staple tried and true anabolics, they train hard and put their head down, they eat properly, and they do it for years on end. That's why the best bodybuilders are able to put on 5 to 10 pounds of lean tissue a year even after they've already put on their huge massive amounts of newbie steroid gains. At the end of the day, eating and training takes the priority over the drugs. If your diet was perfect and you were consistently in a surplus, even if you were natural, you would gain muscle. If your diet sucked and you weren’t eating enough, but were on boatloads of anabolic agents, you would probably gain less muscle during your steroid cycle than you would have naturally had you ate enough. This is why food trumps drugs and is the most anabolic component of any performance enhancing drug regimen.  How A Steroid Cycle Actually Builds Muscle The drugs are what will put the body in a hormonal environment conducive to utilizing food/nutrients as efficiently as possible. Nutrient partitioning is greatly enhanced, as are many other mediators of muscular recovery and growth when operating with a heightened level of exogenous anabolic hormone support. Steroids will put an athlete into a supraphysiological recovery mode enabling lean muscle growth above and beyond that of a natural athlete. But, at the end of the day if your diet sucks, your steroid cycle is not going to take you anywhere, because they only work in the presence of adequate nutrients to actually make use of. All Anabolics Mostly Accomplish The Same Thing When it comes to steroids, there are compounds that actually have a minimal effect on overall muscle growth like Masteron and Proviron. They are used just as pre-contest hardeners or mediators of lowering SHBG levels in the body. And on the other side of the spectrum, there are drugs that are widely considered staple mass gainers in the offseason, and there are certainly drugs that fall in between the spectrum of both of those. However, in most cases with anabolic agents, especially when it comes to SARMs, they more or less accomplish the same thing in the human body. That isn’t to say there aren’t drugs that blatantly build more muscle than others, but in most cases, with adequate nutrients present, they perform a nearly identical function in the body, the overall body composition just may look different comparing one to another. Allow me to elaborate on that a bit here. Which SARMs Are The Best For Building Muscle? In general, the mainstream SARMs do not differ greatly from one another with one being blatantly light years better than the others. They have the same mechanism of action, and are all designed to be as selective as possible for muscle to prostate, as opposed to steroids where there are fairly significant differences in anabolic to androgenic ratios across the spectrum. For example, if someone is racking their brain to figure out whether LGD-4033 or RAD140 will better complement their Ostarine, that is not a make or break choice that will provide more than a negligible amount of difference at the end of the day. What's going to make the massive difference isn't choosing between RAD140 over LGD-4033, it's going to be eating in a consistent surplus and training with progressive overload on a weekly basis, consistently, for weeks on end without fail. That's what makes the difference at the end of the day if the end result is great or not. Take A Step Back To Evaluate Your Diet I’m not trying to take away from the fact that the anabolics in a steroid cycle will be the difference maker in achieving a physique beyond one’s genetic potential. However, I’m trying to stress the importance of what is actually going to dictate if you make a ton of progress or not, which at the end of the day is going to be your consistency long term and just putting your head down and doing what's necessary in the kitchen, gym, and getting adequate rest. I strongly encourage you to take a step back and look at your diet in addition to your protocol, because at the end of the day, the protocol isn't the thing that's going to 100% dictate if you make huge amounts of progress year in and year out. Almost every single time I get a message from someone asking why they didn’t make any progress during their last steroid cycle, 9/10 times they had a severely deficient diet in either macronutrients and/or micronutrients, had a subpar training regimen, or weren’t sleeping enough. In maybe 1-10% of cases at most the reason is something unrelated like drug quality or some other unaddressed lifestyle factor.

    "content": "Does Finasteride Lower Testosterone Levels?      Table of Contents ToggleFinasteride MythsFinasteride’s Mechanism Of ActionHow Finasteride Increases Testosterone And Estrogen LevelsWhat Actually Causes Low Libido And Erectile Dysfunction Side EffectsHow To Cure Post-Finasteride SyndromeRelated Finasteride Myths A very common misconception about Finasteride (also known as Propecia and Proscar) is the belief that it lowers testosterone levels. This is typically derived from the fact that Finasteride can lower libido and cause erectile dysfunction in a minority of users [R, R, R]. Another common misconception is the belief that it increases Estrogen and can cause gynecomastia on its own. Also, it has become apparent to me that many doctors who are prescribing this drug aren’t properly educated on its mechanism of action and will commonly tell their patients that one of the side effects of Finasteride is lowered Testosterone. It's actually the complete opposite.  Finasteride’s Mechanism Of Action After taking Finasteride there are a few hormonal events that unfold in the body. The first thing that happens is Finasteride inhibits Type II 5-alpha reductase [R]. 5-alpha reductase is an intracellular enzyme that regulates the conversion of the androgen testosterone into the more androgenic metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT) [R]. If you take Finasteride, or you are planning on taking it, you should be aware that DHT is the byproduct metabolite of testosterone. It is another hormone entirely and it is significantly more androgenic than any other anabolic hormone in the body, hence why it has the ability to miniaturize hair follicles to a much greater extent [R]. The more androgenic a hormone is the more havoc it can wreak on your hair in a dose dependent manner [R]. DHT is far more androgenic than testosterone, and when there is enough of it circulating in someone prone to male pattern baldness (almost every man on earth) it results in the growth phase of the hair cycle becoming progressively shorter. The individual hairs in androgen affected areas of the scalp are unable to grow to full size as a result of this shorter window of growth, and the end result is their progressive decrease in size. This process is referred to as “hair follicle miniaturization” and is the primary mechanism responsible for the progression of hair loss. The goal of Finasteride is to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to DHT. By inhibiting 5-alpha reductase, Finasteride effectively prevents a significant amount of testosterone to DHT conversion that would have otherwise occurred. How Finasteride Increases Testosterone And Estrogen Levels After Finasteride inhibits 5-alpha reductase, a significant amount of conversion of testosterone to DHT that would have otherwise occurred is no longer going to happen, so that testosterone remains present in the body as unaffected testosterone. Inhibition of Type II 5-alpha reductase blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations. As there is now a much greater portion of testosterone that the body cannot convert into DHT, serum testosterone levels are raised indirectly simply due to the fact that the testosterone has nowhere to go because 5-alpha reductase is inhibited from completing the job it normally does. Within 24 hours of oral dosing 1 milligram of Finasteride, serum DHT concentrations in the body are suppressed by 65%, and mean circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol increase by approximately 15% [R].  Estradiol is the primary estrogen hormone in the body, and the reason estrogen increases is because testosterone has also increased. Testosterone aromatizes into estrogen, and because testosterone increases as a result of 5-alpha reductase inhibition, aromatization into estrogen inevitably increases as well in parallel to it. What Actually Causes Low Libido And Erectile Dysfunction Side Effects If someone has a crash in their libido as a result of Finasteride, it is most often the result of their systemic androgen load going down. Not their testosterone levels going down. It is typically the DHT suppression that causes libido and erectile dysfunction in a minority of users. The elevation in Estrogen levels can also play a role, but typically this is only a concern secondarily to DHT suppression. Finasteride does not inherently decrease sex drive or lower libido; it is the inhibition of DHT and concurrent elevation of aromatization, which largely influences erectile function if there isn't enough free testosterone present in the body to fill the void of those physiological mechanisms. This is why “Post-Finasteride Syndrome” is more often than not essentially just the result of a low systemic androgen load. Even if someone has in range Total Testosterone levels, a significant amount of that may be bound up by sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Reference ranges are also not based on a young and healthy population, so falling within a physiologic reference range may mean nothing at the end of the day if your body needs more of a certain hormone than the next guy. Another possible scenario is that an individual’s free testosterone levels are simply not high enough to fulfill the androgenic void left by an absence of DHT. Also, if estrogen levels are pushed too high from increased aromatization and that goes unaddressed, that can cause severe erectile dysfunction as well until those levels are managed correctly via lifestyle changes, diet, losing body fat, supplements, or in worst case scenarios, manual estrogen management via an aromatase inhibitor (not something you want to be using long term). How To Cure Post-Finasteride Syndrome As mentioned above, the incidence of sexual dysfunction in men using 5-alpha reductase inhibitors shouldn’t be perceived as a side effect of inhibiting DHT, rather, it should be viewed as a potential consequence of lowering the body’s endogenous androgen load relative to estrogen levels in the body. There are hundreds, if not thousands of androgens. These are synthetic, and not endogenously produced in the human body via the endocrine system like testosterone and DHT are, but they can serve similar functions in the body regardless. In a dose dependent manner, all androgens will induce androgenic effects in the body, and the amount to which they do this is relative to their selectivity for muscle and bone to androgen affected tissues like the prostate, hair follicles, etc. Hypothetically, if a guy started getting ED while on Finasteride, and he got a blood test, I would with a fairly high level of certainty bet that his free testosterone levels aren’t on the high end of the reference range, his SHBG is too high, or his estrogen levels are too high (or too low). I used Dutasteride for over a year straight with my Testosterone Replacement Therapy. I had DHT levels lower than a woman for over a year, confirmed by my blood work, and I had 0 libido issues or erectile dysfunction.  I would actually prefer if my libido was lower, I’d get way more work done. The reason my libido was unaffected is because I manually keep my Testosterone levels at 1000-1200 ng/dL, and for a fair portion of my hair loss experiments in 2018 I was pushing those levels up to 2000 ng/dL (a supraphysiological level that no human could naturally produce). Throughout the entirety of that, I had zero issues, because my body simply didn’t need the DHT at all as it had so much present testosterone that is more than androgenic enough to fulfill those physiological functions. That doesn’t mean that you should start popping Dutasteride and pinning Testosterone though obviously, I’m just trying to provide a real life example of how the androgen-fulfilled functions in the body can be accomplished with hormones other than DHT. I am confident that a guy with Post-Finasteride Syndrome could in theory use an extremely androgenic DHT derivative like Proviron, Masteron, or even just literal DHT, and successfully restore whatever loss of function they are experiencing in a dose dependent manner, pending they also kept their other values in range (like Estrogen), as those can cause sexual dysfunction irrespective of androgen levels in the body. It's important to understand how these hormones work before you take Finasteride (or any drug for that matter). The onus is on us to understand how processes unfold in the body so we can mitigate issues if they are to occur, and ideally prevent them from occurring in the first place.

    "content": "The Real Reason Why Connor Murphy Lost His Gains (And His Hair)     If you follow a lot of fitness channels, I'm sure you have probably stumbled across Connor Murphy’s content before, or you might follow it already. If you don't know who he is, essentially his channel revolves around him going downtown, interviewing girls and creating unique scenarios that always eventually end with him taking his shirt off.  His channel blew up in 2016/2017, but for a while now he's come under fire for his physique substantially regressing.  Compared to when he first started YouTube, it looks like he's lost about 10 to 15 pounds of muscle. He's made response videos attempting to justify his perceived muscle loss because it's gotten so out of control with people constantly commenting about it on his videos.  “I probably gained one to two percent body fat. I kind of wanted to bulk. A second thing man is lighting. The only way you could really tell if your abs are getting better or worse is if you're in the exact same lighting's. And then there's also little things like water retention”. I think he's handling the situation fairly well considering how many people are jumping on top of him over this.        Obviously, the first thing everyone assumes is “he stopped taking steroids.” I have made a video on a similar situation in the past addressing Jeremy Buendia’s physique regression when he went through surgery and how quickly he lost his gains.  In that situation I would think it's pretty inconceivable for a guy who's an Olympia champion to come off of gear completely during surgery. I don't know why everyone associates surgery and gaining a bunch of fat because you're doing nothing, eating like crap, and not training, with coming off of all gear. In the scenario with Jeremy Buendia that I made a video about, I talked about how he was more than likely still on something in some capacity; even though it looks he lost a bunch of tissue. In reality he just got super fluffy, and maybe lost a few pounds of muscle at most, but I predicted he'd quickly get back to Olympia stage shape as he hadn’t regressed nearly as much as every one was interpreting he did based on his pictures (which he did end up doing). Nobody who values their lean muscle would come off of all anabolics during surgery, that would be the absolute most compromising position to put yourself in to lose muscle, so you can more often than not bet that these guys are still at least on bit of Testosterone. In Connor’s case however, I think the factor that led to coming off of gear was that he started noticing severe hair loss.  I’m no stranger to hair loss, if you've seen some of my content you'll know I'm prone to male pattern baldness and I've been fighting it for years and years. I've made several videos about it and I've also covered an array of niche topics that discuss hair loss exacerbated by anabolic steroids in particular. If you're administering a supraphysiological amount of androgens into your body, you're just severely accelerating the process at which you're balding if you're genetically prone to it. This is exactly what I'm interpreting has happened to Connor Murphy. His hairline seems to be getting a lot worse.  It's getting thin at the front, it's starting to recede pretty heavily, and I think the original reason he came off of gear in the first place was because of the hair loss he was noticing over time. It's gotten so bad to the point where he's been forced to stop taking exogenous androgens because whatever he was using was blatantly accelerating his Androgenic Alopecia (AGA). And now he's in a really shitty situation, because he has to keep making videos that are so entirely centered around his physique, yet his physique has substantially regressed because he had to come off of gear. Obviously I can't prove he's come off of anything, he could actually be a lifetime natural for all we know, this is just my educated guess based on my own experience with this stuff. Objectively looking at the before and after comparisons of 2016, going into 2017, 2018, and now in 2019, I think there was definitely some hormone assistance in there at some point in 2016, and it was probably discontinued sometime in mid 2017. Whatever he took (hypothetically) started accelerating his AGA, and he likely started to tone it down a bit, and eventually had to come off of gear entirely to prevent his hair loss from getting way worse. Now he's more than likely off of everything (and has been for a while now), lost the supraphysiological tissue he was holding while he was on whatever anabolics he was on, and now he can't go back on cycle to get that muscle back because he knows if he goes back on, he's just going to accelerate his AGA even more. It’s an interesting predicament he's in, as he's been forced to make up all these poor excuses for why it's happening, as well as continue making videos centered around his physique (the entire premise of his channel is essentially taking his shirt off) despite the comments section brutalizing him for regressing so severely.      I'm not sure if Connor claims he’s natural or not, but just based on my own personal experience, I would say he likely hasn't been natural for the entirety of his online presence. Maybe it wasn't obvious when he actually was using anabolics, but the blatant regression in late 2017/2018 suggests that he could no longer sustain his 2016 physique without a certain amount of necessary exogenous hormone support in his system.

For a genetic elite, yes, and by all means he has good genetics, but I believe the physique he has now is more indicative of what his natural endogenous hormone production is really capable of holding onto. Which is still a good physique by all means, but he’s absolutely softer and smaller than he used to be.

I don’t know if he’ll ever open up about the whole situation, and if you go get a pump and go under good lighting it does make a big difference, I agree with him there. But in his situation in particular, with the amount of tissue he lost, you can't blame that on lighting, and you can't blame that on anything realistically except for what it is. I think coupled with the hair loss, it would be pretty difficult to convince anyone who's taken steroids and knows what signs to look for otherwise. This is just another good real world example that young guys aspiring to get a good physique can use as a reference of what is actually achievable naturally, and what pushing yourself over the genetic limit with exogenous hormones can do. Not to mention what not getting a hair loss prevention regimen in place can do. I doubt Connor was using boatloads of drugs, and I’d venture to guess that him losing that much ground on his hairline was likely preventable if he was on a solid prevention protocol from the get-go. Side note: Keep in mind, both Connor's old 2016 physique, and his current one, would likely yield similar results with women. It's mostly guys who are going to critique him with harsh men's physique olympia tier standards, but girls will not care whatsoever, which is an important takeaway. His current physique is still lean, athletic looking, and has enough muscle mass to be mass-appealing to the standards of women.

    "content": "Martina Big Claims She’s Black From Melanotan II Injections | Will Melanotan II Permanently Darken Your Skin?      Martina Big has been in the news before apparently, although I'm just seeing it for the first time now. She has received a fair bit of coverage not only for her crazy research chemical experimentation (with Melanotan II), but more so for her claiming she has changed her race from white to black. She thinks she's actually changing her ethnicity by increasing the amount of melanin in her skin, but that's not the case, and I felt like an article was justified on the topic as I consider myself a pretty veteran Melanotan II user. Before Melanotan II Usage (Original Skin Color) Vs Mid Melanotan II Usage There's a ton of misinformation in this most recent interview with her, and is what prompted my interest in going through the interview with you guys and correcting the incorrect information. I’ve used Melanotan II many times before, for as long as a year straight. In the lighting I typically record my videos in you can't really tell, but if you go look at some of my training videos you can clearly see that my skin is actually permanently darker now even though I haven't used Melanotan II for over a year now, and I get minimal sun exposure (literally almost never). Before Melanotan II Usage (Original Skin Color) Vs Mid Melanotan II Usage Before Melanotan II Usage (Original Skin Color) Vs Mid Melanotan II Usage Over 1 Year Without Melanotan II And No Tanning  My base color is actually darker than it used to be because of the long term Melanotan II usage. The extent to which Martina Big has taken her Melanotan usage is obviously next level though. Not only is she chronically abusing the drug, but she is misrepresenting it entirely and stating that it changes people from white to black (yes their literal ethnicity) and that's certainly not the case. To clarify, Melanotan II can permanently darken your skin, however, it's not to the extent that Martina Big is alluding to in her video whatsoever.  “Spending life in Germany as a light-skinned blonde girl making headlines around the world when she had injections to change the color of her skin”. – “Over the past two years Martina Big has radically altered her appearance in order to become a black woman and This Morning has followed every step of her controversial story”. – “I like my natural blonde beauty but as well, it's like tuning if boys get a new car, they start tuning and then they see oh, it's nice.” – “But what was it that made you realize that you wanted to change?” “At first, I only want to have some tan and this new medicine, they told it will protect this skin against the Sun and really make more tan”. Okay, the first thing I want to comment on is how she refers to these “tanning injections” as “new medicine”. Melanotan II is not medicine; nor is it approved for human use. Melanotan II a drug that never made it through clinical trials. There's no concrete way to use this stuff nor is there a legal way to do it. Her referring to it as medicine is already misrepresenting what this drug is in the first place. Let’s continue. “At this point they didn't know that it will work really, really, really good for me.” – “So, this is the Melatonin injections, and this was your surgeon and they cost £170 a go. You’ve had three is that right?” Okay, this part exemplifies how Holly Willough (the host) has no idea what she's talking about and has not done proper research. I'm nearly positive she said “Melatonin” injections. I probably don't even need to tell you how “Melanotan” and “Melatonin” are two completely different things. Melatonin is a hormone endogenously produced that regulates your circadian rhythm and helps you fall asleep. It’s in a lot of over the counter sleep supplements (e.g. Gorilla Dream), and is commonly used to reset your internal clock if you went traveling and had jetlag. Melatonin is not what this lady used. She used Melanotan II. First of all, if you have a surgeon who offers Melanotan II injections as a service it's illegal. Also, them charging £170 per injection is obscenely overpriced. You can buy a full vial for 1/10th that price. So here we have an approved cosmetic surgeon, buying a generic unapproved drug from China for ten bucks a vial (rough estimate) and then selling a prescribed “medicinal” dosage as a service, and injecting it into their patients for an insane markup. As mentioned, it’s not a medicine, it's not legal to sell or to inject into a patient, that’s for sure, and the fact that this isn't being clarified in this interview was pretty baffling. They're just talking about Melanotan II like it's something just prescribed normally for getting darker skin. It's definitely not. “Michael and I had the same injections, at the same time two years ago but only three injections.” Here she states how she had three shots years ago. No she didn't. She's still using it to this day. There's no way in hell she went from white to black without chronic use of this stuff. I guarantee you she's buying it herself online and injecting it into herself in very high dosages. You can't pin three shots of Melanotan II and go from white to black and maintain it for years on end. Even if the three shots were mega dosed to the point where she was vomiting everywhere (if you use way too much Melanotan II you’re probably going to puke or feel extremely sick – nausea is a common side effect) she would have darkened her skin to quite an extent, but it wouldn't have lasted for two years. As a reference guide, the amount my skin's faded after not using it for a year, after using it for a year straight prior to that, I know how much this stuff can permanently darken your skin and how long the tan lasts, and her current skin color is definitely indicative of her still injecting it to this day on her own to continue getting darker, or maintain how dark she is. Without the Melanotan II injections she would not be able to maintain that amount of Melanogenesis in her body because her body simply doesn't endogenously have the ability to do that. It's being stimulated by this drug to increase the amount of Melanogenesis in her body to react from the external stimuli to get that deep of a tan, and there's no way she would be able to maintain that otherwise. White people have way less Melanogenesis occurring in their body; therefore they have less of a response to UV rays. Because they have less Melanogenesis occurring endogenously, they can't produce as much melanin to protect the hypodermis (the layer under the skin) from the potentially damaging UV rays. The amount of Melanogenesis in our body that acts as a mechanism to increase melanin is essentially a regulator of how much protection you will get from the sun. It’s like how capable your body is of creating a shield against the UV rays. White people simply have a much lower amount of that process occurring, and the only way you can maintain the color of skin she has as a Caucasian woman is through synthetic stimulation of that process, because you can't just inject the drug a few times years ago and have that amount of Melanogenesis continue thereafter. You have to continue stimulating it through synthetic means to maintain that. She's pretty much lying here and saying she had three shots only. I guarantee she's using mega doses to this day. “And other changes also because it's not just been skin.” – “As well for me you can see skin is getting darker from this beginning from the first week. In the course of time you also could see the eye color is getting darker, eyebrow color is getting darker, my growing hair is changing this route and getting curly and more dark and everything changes. But there's a difference here because that's one thing, the sort of visual aspect of how you now…” Okay, so that is partially true. Melanotan II will in a dose-dependent manner increase Melanogenesis endogenously, which darkens the pigment of your skin in response to UV rays, as well as darkens facial hair, eyebrows, hair on the head, and hair on the body. If you get extreme abusive dosage territory it can darken your eyes too. Personally, I did have a bit of darkening of my facial hair but that was about it, and it returned to normal within a couple months of discontinuing the drug. My eyes never darkened whatsoever. This woman is clearly using absurd amounts. There's no way you can darken your eyes significantly without abusing the hell out of the drug. Based on her skin color now and her eyes changing colors too, that's 100% indicative of continuous abuse. Not that there's a concrete therapeutic dosage that separates use from abuse because it's not approved for human use anyways, but you get what I mean. “I can clearly feel that I'm black but it's really hard to find the right words to explain people who are not involved. Oh, this medicine is not only working for only for the skin, it's changing everything together. The feelings change.” – “Sorry to interrupt you, you're saying that it wasn't until you had the injection that you realize that you identified?” – “The injections only started the process but being black it's not only being different color, it's everything in total. For example, when I go outside now, I'm getting in touch with the dark people much easier and I have a lot of stuff when I compared to my African friends I have more in common than with my German friends.” – “There are lots of people that will be watching this that will be upset about what you're saying and they'll be offended by it.” Another thing to comment on is her hair getting curly. That's not an effect from Melanotan II whatsoever; she's making that up. She's curling it herself. The drug does nothing to how straight your hair is. If she's claiming her hair curling is a result of Melanotan II injections, I think it is far more likely that she’s just curling it herself and claiming it’s the drug. “I think what we're trying to ask and again a lot of people out there probably going to be thinking this and it's a lot more, the culture it's in you basically but you're saying that you're learning it and it's hard to learn another race and that's basically what you're doing. Is that right to say?” “Something you did say to us was that you've got married and congratulations and that's lovely. One day you are thinking about having babies, and you've been told by a doctor that your children will be black?” – “Yeah, they said they will be black.” The way this drug works is it stimulates a greater endogenous amount of Melanogenesis, equating to more Melanin production in the skin in response to UV exposure. The process by which that occurs doesn't alter your chromosomes or your genetic code. It's like me saying, “If I inject a gram of testosterone into myself I'm going to have a superhuman kid whose balls produce a gram of test on their own”. That's just not how it works whatsoever. Using a synthetic drug to stimulate an endogenous process in the body cannot pass on that same level of stimulation to your child’s genetics, as that process isn’t transcribed in your genetic code to begin with. Their kid is going to be white for sure if they're both white to begin with, that's just how it works. The drug is not going to alter that whatsoever and I'm wondering if this is the same doctor that sold them the injections in the first place that told them this because they don’t seem like the sharpest tool in the shed. This interview is just a huge misrepresentation of what this drug is and what it does. When I saw the story’s title before I even watched it, I knew it was going to be about Melanotan and I knew I was going to want to make a video on it because it's such an obscure drug that is so misrepresented in the media.

    "content": "Brad Castleberry Weights Are Actually Real? | How Much Your Spotter Touching The Bar ACTUALLY Helps     Brad Castleberry Doesn’t Use Fake Weights, But He Cheats With A Spotter – Debate With the fake weight craze trending so much, I decided to make a video covering a very relevant subject that I never see addressed. I’m sure you’ve seen the viral videos of people using fake weights when they are attempting insane lifts with what appear to be absurd amounts of weight. Sometimes, these are obviously fake weights, like the following:  However, sometimes it’s not as obvious, and there are even cases where I believe the weights are in fact real, but the person just has their spotter doing a significant amount of the work for them. For example:                View this post on Instagram                      Attack Mode!! Something that has really helped shape my body has been getting spots and doing overloads. Get the results and stay injury free!!! @24hourfitness Haters might say fake but all the real ones know what’s real and not.. focus on you and being positive!!! HAPPY MONDAY EVERYONE!!! #live #love #beyou #helpothers #easywork #lightweight #castleberrynutrition #worldrecord @castleberrynutrition WWW.BRADCASTLEBERRY.COM A post shared by  Bradly Castleberry (@bradcastleberry) on Jan 7, 2019 at 10:38am PST   \n\n Brad has claimed “world record” on lifts like this, where the spotter blatantly exerts a significant amount of effort to help him lift the weight up, and then many viewers claim it must be fake weights. Both are incorrect, as they don't realize how much just a spotter putting their hands on the bar actually helps. Well, I’m sure Brad is aware, but he will never admit it, which is why he doesn’t show up to challenges where he knows he won’t have a spotter to lift 100+ pounds off of his weights for him. This “super spotting” is in a lot of these fake weight videos. I constantly see people failing to mention that the spotters in many of these videos are touching the bar and how much it helps, and they just assume that it must be fake weights instead. This is likely the case with many individuals, but with some, I do believe the weights are real, but the spotters are just helping them so much that it makes them capable of lifting a weight they would never be able to do otherwise. Do I think that’s the case with all of Brad Castleberry’s lifts? I’m honestly not sure if that’s the case in every single lift he’s ever done on camera, but I do think he is strong as hell and has at least been able to max out 5 plates on the flat bench unassisted at one point (it seems like he used to be stronger than he is now). With a spotter literally deadlifting the bar off his chest, is it plausible that he could do an assisted 7 plate bench for 1 rep? I think so. The problematic thing with him is that he will never be able to perform these absurd lifts in person because he has spent so much time trying to convince people that he can actually do a 6 or 7 plate bench, and he knows if he shows up to an event and tries it, he would get destroyed. Here is an example of Brad Castleberry incline benching 4 plates without a spotter there to help him:                View this post on Instagram                      Toying around with some weights on a Monday night.

He would get so much more respect if he never tried to be such a showman and hype himself up, and just straight up showed how legitimately strong he is. DOGGCRAPP Discusses The Legitimacy Of Brad Castleberry DOGGCRAPP (Dante Trudel) is the creator of “DC Training”, which you have probably heard of at one time or another if you’re in the bodybuilding community. He is a very well respected coach in the industry, and is a veteran bodybuilder who is an extremely credible source of information. He even thinks that the weights Brad uses are real, because he literally goes to his gym and has seen them hundreds of times.   Another Example Of Exactly How Much A Spotter Can Help (Without Looking Like They Are) Here, we have my buddy Chase (shoot him a follow for helping me out with this video).  He has 3 plates on the bar, and he benches it for 6 reps unassisted, and can probably hit 7-8 reps completely fresh. After already going to failure on 3 separate sets, he gets back on the bench and lets me super spot him (put my hands on the bar and cheat for him). You can see in the super spotting set, he knocks out 17 reps, even after pre-exhausting his chest with several sets to failure unassisted prior. So, just by me lightly guiding the bar up and down with him, I tripled the amount of reps he could do with 3 plates on the bench, and I’m sure if I really went out of my way to deadlift it like these spotters are doing in these fake PR videos, I could quadruple or even quintuple the amount of reps he could do. You'll commonly find people doing commentary on these absurd lifts in videos talking about how it must be fake weights, but oftentimes they don't account for the 100+ pounds of extra help you get just from the spotter touching the bar. Even just having a spotter’s fingers lightly resting on the bar helps a ton. If you've done several PR attempts before, or trained for strength in general and have had someone give you a garbage spot and touch the bar way too early, you know as well as I do how much that really helps, and how it totally ruins the integrity of the lift. Anyway, I thought it would be cool to exemplify the difference between what you can actually do versus what you can do with a spotter lightly touching the bar during a PR attempt. It can be pretty shocking to some just how much a light touch can really translate in overall assistance.

    "content": "Men’s Winter Style Guide | Coats     In order of appearance (these are not affiliate links): Zara Lapel Coat (Black) Zara Lapel Coat (Camel) River Island Smart Overcoat In Grey Jack & Jones Wool Dress Coat (Black) Having at least one good coat in the Winter for going on dates, going downtown, going to events, or just when you want to look good is essential. I'm going to give you some examples of coats I would highly recommend. What To Wear Under A Coat This is a general guideline I follow. The first thing I do is I make sure I have a good neutral color underneath, as well as a neutral jean. For shoes, you would probably want to go with boots or dress shoes depending on the formality of where you're going for coats like this. You wouldn't wear sneakers, you wouldn't wear running shoes, you wouldn't wear casual loafers, you wouldn’t wear sandals, etc. I think that's straightforward, but these are semi-formal kind of outfits is the main point, and your shoes need to match. Unless where I’m going is going to be very formal, I will typically wear a slim fitting neutral colored shirt underneath (look for slim fit shirts with at least 2% elastane in them), with slim-fitting jeans (also with some elastane), and a pair of dressy boots (not to be confused with work boots, hiking boots, or Timberlands). Zara Lapel Coat (Black) This is the Zara Lapel Coat.  The one thing I want you to take note of for something like this is how it kind of tapers in the middle to streamline it for a physique that has a V-Taper. That's super important. Also, take note of the shoulders.  It's hard to find something in suit jackets or coats that aren't capped off with a square. When you have a totally squared off shoulder, it creates a very boxy look as opposed to a tall, lean, slimmer looking physique. It's not very complementary to a physique if it's totally boxed off. Ideally you want to have the shoulder rounded off enough that it doesn't create that look. That's why this coat in particular is so good. A lot of coats (and suit jackets) have a major design flaw in that the shoulders cut at nearly a complete 90-degree angle, and they look terrible. You want to make sure the shoulders aren't boxy, the coat is long enough, it’s tapered to your physique to make yourself appear slimmer, and the ideal color for this first coat would be black. That would be my first recommendation. The reason why it’s my first recommendation is that black pretty much goes with any outfit. You can wear black under it, you can wear white under it, you could wear maroon red, you can wear almost anything under it because black matches with almost everything. This is one of my go-to outfits in the Winter. It’s simple, and looks amazing. It's very neutral but still edgy, super easy to mix and match with your wardrobe, and has the most versatility. As far as accessories, I might wear a scarf around this too (depending on the weather), and I always wear a watch, but that’s pretty much it. Zara Lapel Coat (Camel) Camel coats are very trendy right now. This is the Zara Lapel Coat, in Camel color.  Camel is less neutral, meaning you won’t be able to put a lot of different colors under it, so it's less versatile than the black coat. That’s why I don't recommend this being the first go-to color, and I always recommend black if you’re only going to pick one. Black is the go-to color for every piece of clothing if you're only getting one (in most cases). If you're on a budget, get the black one. If you're trying to expand your wardrobe though and you have the funds, I would highly recommend getting a nice camel colored coat like this. Again, the same sort of outfit works with this:  Neutral colored slim fit shirt underneath Nice tapered jeans  (the only thing that goes with these coats are jeans or dress pants in my opinion).   Dressy boots or dress shoes  Again, you want rounded off shoulders, with the coat tapered to your physique.  When you have a coat that looks like a rectangle on you it totally kills the aesthetic of it. You want to get something that looks good on you, not just on a mannequin or on a model you’ve seen online. Personally, I think the Zara coats look terrible on the models online, but on me they look awesome. But, on the other side of the spectrum, one time I bought a $300 coat that looked awesome on a model online, and then when I got it and tried it on it looked horrible on me. Those are perfect examples of why it is so important that you try coats on before you get locked into keeping one. And by that I mean – Be careful about what you're ordering. Make sure you have a good return policy on it so you can send it back if it's terrible, or try it on the store properly because what it looks like on one guy, could differ entirely from how it will look on you. This jacket could easily be terrible looking on me if it had just a few inches of extra room in certain areas. While the camel coat matches less colors, it has a bit more of a “WOW” factor than the black one. This coat gets me a ton of compliments and I would highly recommend this as your second coat if you're looking to expand your wardrobe. River Island Smart Overcoat In Grey   I prefer to wear this coat with white underneath and a lighter wash of jean. I feel like the lighter colors complement the grey nicely, and I’m always wearing dark colors so it’s nice to mix it up, and this coat gives me the opportunity to wear some brighter colors for a change. It doesn't mean you couldn't wear other colors with it, because you definitely can; this is just typically the outfit coordination I go for when I wear it. This is a really flattering coat that fits snugly around the arms, and slims you out nicely. One thing you have to be very careful of with these kinds of coats is that they're not too loose in the arms, because they can look really stupid if there's too much space in there. Bad Not only be aware of how it's going to fit on the torso, make sure you check your arms as well. If I had a huge gap in the arms, this coat would go from looking amazing to looking horrible just from a few inches of extra material. I mentioned it earlier but it’s very important so I’ll mention it again – It doesn't take very much for a jacket to go from good looking to bad looking just based on a few inches in the cut in a certain direction. Bad Good Make sure you try it on first and the store has a good return policy if you are shopping online. Coats will either look good on you, or they won't. Plain and simple. By that I mean – Coats can’t really form fit to accommodate different body types, so it's either going to look good, or it's just not. The only pieces of clothing less forgiving are suits in my opinion, so tread with caution when shopping online. Jack & Jones Wool Dress Coat (Black)  If you look at the collar on this one, you'll notice its more similar to a tuxedo style than the first Black Lapel Coat. If you're going to a fancy event, fancy dinner, fancy whatever, this is a bit of a step up in formality over the first black coat. Granted, the model dressed it down with an orange hoodie underneath so it's a bit harder to exemplify this, but the versatility of this coat for all levels of formality is the best among this whole list in my opinion. It is a “dress coat”. There's not a huge difference between the first black coat and this one, and largely it will come down to individual preference as well, but I think that coats like this with the more obvious frontal collars are a bit fancier. This is a dress coat you can wear to formal events, as opposed to the other coats that probably won’t cut it at very formal outings. Now, there’s not a huge difference like I said, but it’s a bit more complimentary for dressy occasions, although it can also be worn during semi-formal occasions like dates, family gatherings, going out with your friends downtown, or whatever it may be.  If you were to choose just one coat, I would recommend getting the first black one, or this one. It's more of a personal preference based on the type you want, and I don’t think you can really go wrong with either. Again, this is something you could easily wear on a date any time. Key being the rounded off shoulders, not squared. Tapered around the waist. Taper is key, as you want your coat flattering to your physique, you don't want it to be rectangular like all the other guys out there who don’t know how to dress themselves. If it's too big for you, you'll know because it's not going to look form fitted to your arms, it's not going to look form fitted to your waist, it's just going to be like a big giant blob rectangle hanging off of you. These are the go-to coat styles for this winter in my opinion. These can really spice up an outfit, and pretty much make the outfit in many situations. If you're going to be going out this winter and you're outdoors for any extended period of time, your outfit is going to be mostly based around the coat. The coat is a pretty integral piece in the wintertime because you can't get away with wearing pullover ugly hoodies and lazy garbage like that. You need to edge it up and get some style. Get a nice coat. That's my suggestion. Coats Sizing Checklist  Snug to the arms Snug on the shoulders, which are somewhat rounded off as opposed to blatantly boxy with a sharp 90 degree angle (you don’t want it to look like you have shoulder pads on) You have some space to move your arms away from your body, but not so much that you're sacrificing the taper that you would get from a properly fitted coat  This is the number one mistake men with strong V-Tapers make, is they will get a coat that has full range of motion on the top. This will sound ridiculous because who would get a coat without a full range of motion you’re probably thinking. Unless you’re willing to custom tailor the living hell out of your coats, if you want a coat off the rack that fits a broad shoulder with slim waist physique amazingly (classic V-Taper), you will have to sacrifice some range of motion at the top in order to ensure the coat tapers to your waist enough that it doesn’t look like a giant rectangle tarp dangling off you.

If you've never heard of Mewing, it's a concept named after Mike Mew and John Mew that stands for the proper way to posture yourself while you breathe, swallow, chew, and essentially anything that has to do with your face. Mike Mew and John Mew are Orthodontists who have a different perspective on how teeth develop malocclusion. This perspective revolves around the theory that a lack of proper posture, as well as mouth breathing will eventually lead to spacing issues in the teeth and poor facial development This perspective has been dubbed “Orthotropics.”  What Causes An Ugly Face To Develop? According to Mike and John Mew, genetically, humans are not supposed to have any malocclusion. If you look at skulls from way back in the day when we ate harder foods, supposedly they had perfect teeth.  They propose that most individuals are eating softer food now in a standard Western diet, not chewing adequately to develop the surrounding jaw muscles, and also not breathing through the nose with their mouth closed, with their tongue sitting somewhere other than at the top of the roof of the mouth (where it should be). And the result of this is the lengthening of the mid face, a recession of the jaw, an overall inhibited airway, and a degradation of facial aesthetics caused by the lack of supporting proper forward Maxilla/jaw growth Basically, by not breathing through your nose with your mouth closed, and not maintaining a resting position with your tongue on the roof of your mouth, you will allow gravity to drag your face downwards. This creates a very poor jawline and contributes to Sleep Apnea and other circulation issues. Mouth Breathing Vs Nasal Breathing This was a very informative video on not only the potential structural degradation that can occur from mouth breathing, but the health consequences that could stem from it as well.  This video, along with the Orthotropics channel’s videos, are what pushed me over the edge to really start taking this seriously. The most compelling study mentioned in the video for me was the one that detailed how monkeys essentially totally destroyed their facial structure by manually impeding their nasal passages and forcing them to breathe through their mouths.   Many of the stories of Mike and John’s clients are incredibly unsettling as well (if you’re a mouth breather). E.G. one child who supposedly couldn’t breathe through his nose anymore after he got a pet he was allergic to completely ruined his facial aesthetics within a few years. The kid was literally unrecognizable afterwards. This is supposedly entirely due to incorrect tongue posture and mouth breathing. Age 10 Vs Age 17 In contrast, some of the before and after pictures of patients who adopted Mewing and Orthotropics to improve their facial structure exhibit just as extraordinary results when proper tongue posture and nasal breathing is maintained for several years.      In the study “Influence of Mouth Breathing on the Dentofacial Growth of Children: A Cephalometric Study” it was concluded that “all subjects with mouth-breathing habit exhibited significant lower incisor proclination, lip incompetency and convex facial profile. The presence of adenoids accentuated the facial convexity and mentolabial sulcus depth. A multidisciplinary team should work to have early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, preventing the consequent disorders of chronic mouth breathing. Because upper airway obstruction is an obstacle to normal dentofacial development, mouth breathing children deserve prompt attention before growth has proceeded irreversibly. The early recognition of such facial patterns may be utilized to identify those breathing compromised individuals who are likely to develop such types of malocclusions. Hence, a joint effort by pedodontist, orthodontist, otorhinolaryngologist and pediatrician is thus required for reducing continuing detrimental effects of breathing impairments on facial characteristics.” My Perspective On Mewing  A few guys messaged me about Mewing on Instagram. At first I kind of just wrote it off because it seemed like one of those anti-PUA forum kind of concepts. When I was really active on the Good Looking Loser forums I would see someone new get kicked off the forum almost on a monthly basis because they would be posting pictures of themselves, or examples of others with poor facial structure, and Photoshop them into good looking faces to show what a big difference it is just by altering bone structure a bit. It wasn’t a productive use of time on what I would argue is the most action-oriented forum for guys getting their sex lives in check, which is what led to swift thread locks or perma-bans if the user didn’t show any active interest in improving their lives, and instead just wanted to talk theory about why women are attracted or aren’t attracted to certain faces. Mewing was never discussed though; it was just a lot of theory about facial structure being thrown around by virgins who jumped on the board to rant about their disdain for their faces. In hindsight, I’m surprised the concept wasn’t brought up at least once in any of those threads, as it seems to be pretty popular now, and is mostly why I finally started paying attention to it. I started to watch some of Mike Mew’s videos. He presents a logical science-based perspective of the progression of breathing issues, malocclusion, and overall structural deficiencies in the face, which is what kept me hooked into learning more about this concept. After watching a few of his videos, the first thing that got my interest was the discussion of reversing Sleep Apnea, because I have severe obstructive Sleep Apnea. He also started to delve into mouth breathing and malocclusion, which also raised some red flags for me. I found this all really interesting because I've been a mouth breather my entire life. This is partially because I have a deviated septum from elbows to the face in basketball games, and my tonsils and adenoids apparently are inhibiting my circulation as well to compound the breathing difficulties stemming from the inhibition of my nasal passage. When I was younger I had an x-ray done to actually see where my jaw line sits because one of the first “fixes” for Sleep Apnea that your doctor will tell you about is getting a surgery to move your jaw forward, or using a mouthpiece to push the lower jaw forward, as some people have jaws recessed into their neck that partially blocks their airway. That x-ray revealed that I didn't have any inhibition of my airway in that area. After watching some of Mike Mew’s videos, I started to think that the x-ray results (which showed I’m perfectly fine) are not indicative of what's actually going on. One important thing I’ve noticed when I'm sleeping is that when I'm sitting upright if I fall asleep (e.g. if I fall asleep on the couch watching TV or on the computer), I don't apnea whatsoever, but when I'm lying on my back (how I normally sleep) I apnea like crazy, hundreds of times per night without my CPAP machine. I’ve realized that I’m essentially inhibiting my own airway as my throat and tongue sink back and inhibit my air way, forcing me to open my mouth and mouth breathe all night long. I obviously do not maintain any form of proper tongue posture, as my tongue is literally falling into the back of my mouth and exacerbating my sleep apnea due to gravity. P.S. most body builders that have a decent amount of muscle, or mass in general (fat) have some degree of sleep apnea. If you are a bodybuilder, I highly recommend you get a sleep study done to see if you have sleep apnea, how bad it is (if you have it), and address it immediately with a CPAP machine if you do have it because it's a major health concern that you might not be aware of. Will Adults Still Get Results From Mewing? Mike Mew fully got my attention when he said that if you consciously focus on keeping your mouth shut, keeping your tongue at the roof of your mouth, breathing through your nose and adopting proper swallowing technique that your facial structure can start remodelling in a more favorable way that actually clears up your airway to a significant extent, and improve sleep apnea. His experience is mostly with children, as their facial structure is far more malleable than an adult they experience the best results from these lifestyle changes, however, he is starting to branch out into treating adults, and is pretty convinced that adults can still improve their structure as well, just to a lesser and/or slower extent than children. Taking into account the blatant evidence of structural regression in full grown adults who experience muscular atrophy in the face (e.g. Stephen Hawking), it would only seem logical that the opposite would apply for adults who adopt proper tongue posture and stick to it for a long period of time.  There are several anecdotal cases logged on YouTube and in online forums of individuals in their twenties consistently Mewing and seeing great results, which is promising for those of us who are just learning about this and aren't prepubescent. My Facial Structure And Sleep Apnea One thing I've always noticed is that when I’m really lean I have a pretty sharp angular good looking face from the front, but my side profile is pretty poor still. If I'm not really sticking my head out (which is not proper posture), it kind of just sinks into my neck.                View this post on Instagram                      Soaking up this last bit of Fall ?? A post shared by @ moreplates_moredates on Dec 2, 2017 at 11:43pm PST   \n\n (~8% body fat, but purposely jutting my head out hard to create more separation from my neck) This is exactly what Mike Mew claims will happen to your profile if you mouth breathe. I'm going to try and adopt proper tongue posture and breathe through my nose only from now on, even if that means I have to get a deviated septum surgery and get my tonsils and adenoids removed. I've always written facial structure off as a genetic thing, whereby fat loss was the only thing you could really do to improve your features (which is still the best and fastest way to do that by the way). I just never thought it could contribute to your airway improving just by the way your posture yourself. This is something I'm going to actually take pretty seriously, as there is too much logic piling up for me to ignore it, even if it seems a bit farfetched. The main issue that arises for me off the bat is I have such an inhibited airway that I can't just tape my mouth shut to force nasal breathing when I sleep because I'll probably die to be honest. So, for now, I'm going to try doing it for 16-17 hours throughout the day, and then when I'm sleeping I'm going to prop my head up on pillows to try and have better posture while I'm sleeping to encourage nasal breathing and proper tongue posture. I’ll need to slowly transition into forcing myself to Mew in my sleep too, as I have severe obstructive sleep apnea and just completely blocking my mouth and forcing nasal breathing likely won’t have a good outcome if I go from 0-100 right away. I have a big face mask for my CPAP machine that I use over my face to help me breathe while I'm sleeping. This is essentially just my introduction to what may very well be a life-long Mewing log. If this can cure my sleep apnea that'd be pretty insane, and I'm sure a lot of other guys would want to know about this if it actually works. If you can completely reverse sleep apnea issues by just fixing the way you are postured and the way you're breathing, that would be amazing in itself, and then obviously a side benefit would be improved facial aesthetics too. My Malocclusion Another interesting tidbit regarding mouth breathing leading to malocclusion is that I’ve actually noticed that the right tooth of my two front teeth has started to seemingly jut forward in the past year. I had an appliance when I was a kid, and afterwards I was given a retainer to wear for the rest of my life to keep my teeth from going back to the way they were pre-appliance. I haven't worn that retainer for a decade probably, and I've started to notice lately that the tooth I mentioned seems to be sort of moving. I actually thought at first that I had chipped down my left front tooth as it appeared smaller than my right front tooth, but then after looking closer I actually realized that the front right tooth is starting to jut out, essentially out-angling my front left tooth and appearing longer/bigger. I don't think I’m just seeing things either. I think this is actually slowly happening and I think it could be directly caused by lack of proper tongue posture throughout my life and malocclusion starting to occur without the proper support of the roof of my mouth, keeping my mouth shut and breathing through my nose. Does Mewing Actually Work? This might all seem ridiculous, and maybe it is, who really knows. However, there are a lot of anecdotal cases of people who have really improved themselves by doing this. The only difference I have to make in my life is breathing through my nose as opposed to my mouth pretty much, which I don’t see as a huge inconvenience so I'm just going to start doing it and see what happens. Mewing On Steroids And GH I'm probably the only person who's doing this who is injecting themselves with exogenous androgens, or using synthetic GH or growth hormone secretagogues like Ibutamoren. TRT keeps my total testosterone level around 1,100 – 1,200 nanograms per deciliter, which no natural human can achieve at my level of body fat (barring extreme genetic outliers). Most guys have levels closer to 600 ng/dL. The average is getting worse and worse all the time so maybe even that number is too generous. The tongue is also a muscle so it's going to hyper respond in me who has a significantly higher testosterone level than most other guys trying this. By that I mean the force it can exert upwards and outward to encourage forward jaw development (as opposed to downward) is greater than that of a natural non-enhanced person. I'm going to be interested to see if that makes a difference on how quick I get results or how drastic they are. I also intermittently use MK-677 or small doses of GH to support increased hair density, which has blatantly shown to change bone structure even in full grown adults. Granted, this is usually in the context of GH being used in mega-doses, which leads to Acromegaly and will hinder facial aesthetics, and using the baby dosages I use on and off will likely not make a difference at all, but we shall see. Obviously Mike Mew can't just shoot a patient up with Testosterone or GH to see what happens, so hopefully my log can provide some useful information he can draw off of. All muscle will hyper-respond in my body due to my borderline supraphysiological hormone profile, and I may have a bit more leeway than the average adult when it comes to cranial remodelling from enhanced GH/IGF-1 levels coupled with the increased level of muscular force my tongue can exert. Anyways, I will keep you guys posted on my Mewing experience. It will probably be pretty infrequent because it's going to be a slow process (if it works at all). But, if it helps improve my sleep apnea and helps me breathe better that's going to be a huge win. My Mewing Goals  Improve overall circulation Eliminate incidence of apneas during sleep (I've been using a CPAP machine with a full face mask for 6 years now to accomplish this, but I've never tried physical intervention via tongue posture or angling my body differently during sleep) Improve facial structure  Do I think Mewing is actually going to make a significant difference for me long-term? I have no idea, and it probably seems ridiculous to most people, but it comes at no additional time investment on my behalf so I don't see this as an inconvenience whatsoever. If it works, then great, if it doesn't, it didn't cost me anything. Sleep Apnea is a self-imposed physical inhibition of your own air way (unless it's caused via your brain and lack of/dysfunctional electrical signalling), and I already know for a fact that if I could improve my nasal circulation to encourage nasal breathing, as well as keep my head propped up as opposed to completely flat, I could mitigate Sleep Apnea entirely, however, it remains to be seen if Mewing long-term will eventually allow me to do so comfortably while I am asleep. Surgical intervention will only be taken if it is determined that my nasal passage could have a significantly improved amount of circulation via fixing my deviated septum, and/or removing my tonsils and adenoids, as those are things Mewing obviously can't address, and would inhibit me from comfortably Mewing in the first place, especially while I'm asleep. This is the beginning of what will likely be a very long log assessing this. If you have any experience Mewing and have experienced positive results in your circulation, or Sleep Apnea specifically, your experience would be welcomed and much appreciated in the comments section below. Fat Loss Disclaimer My results shown in this article’s thumbnail are entirely from fat loss (20%+ → 6% body fat). I was mouth breathing the entire time during that period with improper tongue posture (and still have been right up until this article). I'm approximately 10% body fat right now. When it comes to facial aesthetics, fat loss is the fastest and most important thing you can do to achieve an aesthetic face. Celebrity Face Transformations Even if you have Brad Pitt or Val Kilmer facial structure, you will still look like crap if you are holding too much fat. Go look at pictures of them recently and compare it to their faces in their primes.   This was the result of fat gain. Tom Cruise is a perfect example of someone who has maintained very good body composition his entire life, and as expected, his facial aesthetics are not significantly worse than in his prime 20-30 years ago, with the exception of skin aging obviously which is inevitable.  Keanu Reeves is another good example.  Staying lean is the number one most important thing you can do, and perhaps Mewing too (I'll let you know in a year or two).

    "content": "There Are 2 Types Of Hair Loss | Male Pattern Baldness (Permanent) Vs Shedding (Temporary)      What you need to understand about hair loss is that there are two types. One is male pattern baldness, which is the acceleration of hair permanently being lost via androgen miniaturization at the hair follicle, which is what most guys are experiencing. And the other is shedding. Shedding is often misinterpreted as permanent loss, and it can cause a lot of people to make wild changes in their prevention protocols thinking that something's not working, or they are rapidly accelerating their male pattern baldness. First of all, you need to understand what shedding is. Basically, how hair naturally grows is in a life cycle. And this life cycle is fairly long as your hair goes through a growth phase and eventually completes the life cycle and falls out of your head. Everyone has his or her own life cycle.

What’s The First Thing I Should Do?The Takeaway MessageThe Hair Pull Test To Assess If You Are Experiencing Shedding Or Male Pattern BaldnessIn ConclusionRelated Seasonal Shedding Typically, you're going to have a seasonal shed. That is the first thing you have to realize. This is something I had no clue about and every summer seemingly around the same time I would sporadically lose a bunch of hair. Three years in a row I thought it was my protocol that was just not working anymore. The first couple times I freaked out and I'd start swapping stuff in and out, changing what supplements I was taking, and I would start messing with my TRT. But I started to realize it was a pattern. Every single summer season I would have a brutal shed and it was literally the life cycle of my hair completing and a bunch of hair falling out. Totally normal, but that's not permanent loss and you have to be able to differentiate between the two. Other Causes Of Temporary Shedding You can screw yourself over if you don't assess what's going on correctly. Here are some examples of other things that cause sheds. Chemotherapy For Cancer Cancer patients when get Chemotherapy, they lose their hair and they go bald. Is that a permanent loss? Is that the permanent miniaturization of the hair follicles? No, it's the introduction of harsh chemicals to the body that causes hair to shed. That's a perfect example of shedding which is temporary loss. That hair is going to grow back once you discontinued that stress on your body that's resulting in that shed. Nutrient Deficiencies, Thyroid Conditions/Deficiencies, Autoimmune Diseases, Hormone Imbalances/Deficiencies Another example, let’s say you've totally crushed your DHT with Dutasteride and you're also addressing Testosterone derived miniaturization with an anti-androgen. But you're still losing your hair for some reason. Check your Ferritin and Iron levels. Are those where they're supposed to be? They might not be, which causes hair shedding. What are your Vitamin B12 levels? Are they where they’re supposed to be? Are you getting enough of it? Do you have a Thyroid deficiency? Even if you’re addressing your Thyroid condition with an exogenous source of synthetic Thyroid hormones, do those have fillers in it that your body is having an autoimmune response to? Is your T3 pooling in your blood and not being absorbed into the cells correctly? Do you have adrenal issues caused by a lack of (or excess of) Cortisol? Are your Estrogen levels too low? Do you have an autoimmune disorder caused by leaky gut syndrome where you are not absorbing nutrients properly and/or you're allergic to something you're eating and there is a downstream mechanism occurring in your causing you to shed? There are a lot of things to consider here. Real Life Example Of Autoimmune Disease Causing Hair Loss Somebody I was dating for a while had a leaky gut syndrome. She was intolerant to certain things in her diet (common things in most western diets). The result of that was unknowingly triggering an autoimmune disease, which would attack her Thyroid gland, which caused her to have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. This autoimmune disease would cause her antibody count to go through the roof and she'd get a bunch of Hypothyroid symptoms, including hair loss (temporary shedding). Her thyroid was slowly being killed off and she eventually had to go on thyroid hormone replacement drugs. And that opened her up to a whole new skew of things because if you have too much or too little, you're going to continue to shed. The solution to that would first be addressing the gut microbiome by preventing the leaky gut syndrome with dietary and lifestyle changes, followed by rebuilding of the gut’s healthy bacteria, followed thereafter with exogenous hormone replacement if the Thyroid gland was unable to recover adequate function. Basically in that scenario, the Thyroid hormones are just a bandaid to the issue, which was the autoimmune attack occurring due to lifestyle factors that needed to be changed, which is one of the reasons why some individuals with Hypothyroidism still feel like crap even when they use Thyroid hormones to address their Hypothyroidism. It’s not the root of the issue, and the problem just worsens as time goes on. Other Random Nutritional Examples That I Had To Deal With In The Past Are you having a ton of pasteurized liquid egg whites with avidin in them, which are inhibiting your Biotin from getting absorbed correctly? Are you not having enough Iodine? Do you have an adequate daily intake of Selenium? There’re so many things that you need to look at. This Is Complicated Derek. What’s The First Thing I Should Do? At the end of the day, you want to cover your basis. Prevent androgens from miniaturizing your hair follicles is the first step. This is dealt with by addressing your endogenous DHT and Testosterone. Whichever drugs you choose to go about doing that, or how you go about doing it, will be your personal preference, there’s more than one way to skin a cat, but you need to address your androgens plain and simple. Once you have that base established you can start looking at all the other things if you're still losing your hair. If you're having brutal shedding, did you just start Minoxidil and you haven't waited for the shedding period to complete? Or maybe you've induced acute telogen effluvium because you started using Minoxidil and then you stopped using it abruptly because you were worried about the shedding phase that ensued and you thought it would be permanent instead of sticking it out and you're sporadically going on and off of it. Maybe you’re using other drugs that are causing hormone fluctuations. Hormone fluctuations is another thing that causes shedding. Random peptides and PED’s can cause shedding. Melanotan II for example. It's not even hormonal and it makes a lot of guys experience temporary shedding (for however long they stay on it). There are so many things you have to go look at but the thing you have to realize is if you're covered in your androgens and you're preventing miniaturization from occurring, you're stopping the permanent loss from occurring, which is the main focus here. Then you can focus on the other stuff, which which includes nutritional deficiencies, potential unaddressed underlying autoimmune conditions, hormone deficiencies, etc. The Takeaway Message The takeaway message is that you need to realize shedding is different than Androgenic Alopecia, and it's not permanent. As soon as you remove that stressor from your system, the shedding should discontinue shortly. For example, if you have a hormone fluctuation because you just started Finasteride for the first time, it's accompanied by shed, that's typical. After it completes, then you stop shedding, but does that mean because you're shedding that that's permanent? No, its just part of the process. The same applies for anything non-androgen related really (almost every single time). If you have a Biotin deficiency (rare, but it happens) and then you start getting your Biotin in, then the hair shedding will stop. The reason why shedding is often perceived as permanent loss is because most individuals don’t realize there is something in their lifestyle causing shedding in the first place. The result is that they shed for years on end, which leads to a loss of hair density. Because of the length of time the shedding is occurring, the typical assumption is that it’s just androgenic alopecia, but the reality is that it’s the unaddressed factor causing shedding that still hasn’t been rectified. Until they get those root factors resolved, they will continue to shed until that deficiency, imbalance, condition, whatever it may be, is fixed. The Hair Pull Test To Assess If You Are Experiencing Shedding Or Male Pattern Baldness I don't believe this method is a definitive way to evaluate things, but this is something you can try to assess if you're shedding as opposed to experiencing male pattern baldness. If you're shedding, you're probably going to have shedding all over your head, as opposed to just the androgen prone hairs on the top of your scalp. The hairs on top of your head are the androgen sensitive hair. These are the ones that are going to get miniaturized from androgens. George Costanza is a perfect example of where the border ends between androgen affected hairs, and non-androgen affected hairs on the scalp.  The reason for this pattern is because he has extreme male pattern baldness. Take a pinch of what would be androgen-affected hairs, and then pull out. If you have 3 or more hairs every single time you try that, and you do it several times with each attempt resulting in 3 or more hairs coming out of the top of your head, you're probably experiencing miniaturization of the hair follicles from androgens. If you're experiencing Androgenic Alopecia the hairs on the sides of your head that aren’t affected by androgens won’t come out of your head when you try that same test on them. Alternatively, if you were just shedding you would also get 3 or more hairs when you test the sides (non-androgen affected) of your head. Is that super accurate? Probably not. If you have a fade, or you have really short sides, it's pretty difficult to even pinch hair to begin with to make this assessment. I prefer using blood work and actual scientific methods of addressing things, however, this hair pull test is an easy and quick way to get a quick assessment of your current situation. In Conclusion If one thing in the chain of events to hair growth is out of order, you're likely going to experience hair shedding in some capacity. It's not permanent in the sense of that you're going to never get that hair back, but it is permanent in the sense that you're going to keep shedding it until you address the deficiency/imbalance/whatever it may be. And then once you address it, your hair should return to normal. In my experience, 99% of cases of hair loss in men are androgen related though, caused by your endogenous DHT and Testosterone, so getting a foundation established to deal with the androgen issue should be the number one priority in my opinion.

    "content": "MENT (Trestolone) Experiment – Is It Hair Loss Safe? | Potential HRT Alternative     The potent synthetic androgen Trestolone, also known as 7α-methyl-19-norTestosterone (MENT), does not require 5α-reduction to exert its' maximal androgenic effects. It is an Anabolic Androgenic Steroid (AAS), which has been under development for potential use as a form of hormonal birth control for men and in androgen replacement therapy for low Testosterone levels in men but has never been approved for clinical usage. Its' development for potential clinical use continued in 1993 up until 2013, after a long stint of inactivity following its' initial studies which began in 1963. Alternative androgens are being developed for hormonal therapy which may demonstrate greater potency, duration of action, and oral efficacy than Testosterone. MENT is one of those, as it is a potent orally active synthetic 19-norandrogen. MENT has the potential advantage that it could be used at relatively low doses, is orally bioavailable, and could potentially circumvent some of the negative effects that stem from traditionally used anabolic Steroids converting to 5α-reduced androgens in modern medicine (such as Testosterone Replacement Therapy resulting in higher levels of systemic DHT) that may raise the risk of benign prostate hyperplasia, accelerate the development of prostate carcinoma, increase the probability of acne breakouts, and exacerbate/substantially expedite androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness). Therefore, it was desirable to investigate whether MENT is 5α-reduced in vivo, which could then potentially result in adverse effects similar to those of DHT. The results from that data are extrapolated in this article and are used as a reference to guide my own personal research into this synthetic Anabolic Androgenic Steroid.

My Experiment ResultsIn ConclusionRelated MENT (Trestolone) – Explored As A Potential HRT Alternative This Steroid is not very well understood and is perceived by most as a “next generation” Anabolic Androgenic Steroid. What I wanted to explore specifically is MENT’s potential application in hormone replacement therapy, especially for men who are prone to male pattern baldness from the endogenous Testosterone and DHT in their system like I am. This experiment is geared towards guys with similar mindsets to me in terms of their goals, so don't misconstrue the intention of this article. This experiment is NOT intended to see how effective Trestolone is at building huge amounts of muscle. Basically, what my goal is at this point is to maintain what lean tissue I have, and replicate the same level of anabolism that my TRT accomplishes with a far lower degree of androgenic side-effects. As you may or may not know, Testosterone has a 100:100 anabolic to androgenic rating on paper. In actual practical application though, it has a 2:1 selectivity for muscle tissue to prostate, so it's not very selective whatsoever, meaning it induces significant androgenic side-effects like facial hair, hair follicle miniaturization, prostate growth etc. at doses that are required for sufficient levels of anabolic activity in the male body.  As you likely already know, when it hits 5α-Reductase it also converts partially to DHT, which is several fold more androgenic than the Testosterone already circulating in your system. Does Finasteride Or Dutasteride Decrease How Androgenic MENT Is? MENT (Trestolone) doesn't go undergo conversion to a more androgenic compound when it hits 5α-Reductase. It's about the same level of androgenic activity in the body after it goes through that process, so using a 5α-Reductase inhibitor like Finasteride or Dutasteride doesn't make it any more hair safe.    Different Steroids Affinities To Miniaturize Hair Follicles I've noticed throughout my years that anabolic:androgenic ratios on paper often don’t play out in real life application the way you’d anticipate (the Testosterone example above being one). There's the classic anabolic:androgenic ratings chart. This chart shows how we would assume each Steroid is going to work in the body, however, it doesn't really hold true for most of them. If you go look at Drostanolone (Masteron), if you go look at Anavar, if you go look at Winstrol on paper, the way they interact in the body is WAY different in real life application than it appears that they would behave on paper.  If you look at MENT, you’ll notice the androgenic rating is very high. Most would assume it would rip the hair out of your head without mercy. But one thing you have to consider and one thing I've considered greatly over the past year as I've started to delve into the research of these compounds more is that some of these compounds bind harder to the androgen receptors, some of them are stronger in general, some are more suppressive, and there are a myriad of other individual specific attributes that are not accounted for on paper. It seems as though they all have their own inherent ability to build muscle (induce anabolic activity) relative to their androgenic profiles, but their androgenic profiles aren’t always indicative of how they will affect each person systemically, as there is a genetic component. Trenbolone Hair Loss Example And Androgen Affinities Trenbolone looks five times stronger than Testosterone on paper, but if you’ve used Tren you know that it doesn’t play out like that in actual real life application. The results from 100 milligrams of Tren do not equal the results one can achieve with 500 milligrams of Testosterone, it really doesn't work out like that. But even if something is very androgenic on paper, it's quite possible that despite it seemingly being worse for hair loss at a first glance, the dosage at which it would induce the same amount of muscle retention (anabolic activity) could exhibit a lower overall androgenic effect in the body than the amount of Testosterone necessary to achieve that same level of anabolic activity in the body. In my head I'm thinking okay, my TRT is 125 milligrams per week…  Side note: I dropped my TRT from 150 mg to 125 mg per week since I've adopted a more frequent dosing protocol that keeps my levels higher and more stable. I've noticed I can keep it higher and much more stable with no troughs with a more frequent pinning schedule, which is something I would recommend speaking to your doctor about as well if they have you doing very infrequent shots. With infrequent shots (I even consider twice per week with Enanthate or Cypionate fairly infrequent now) you'll have big spikes and then big valleys where you basically spike your Testosterone and Estrogen unnecessarily, and have increased side-effects by having a big bolus enter into your system at one time, as opposed to having stable consistently high-normal levels. The ideal scenario in my opinion is to replicate as closely as possible how the human body would actually endogenously produce Testosterone, which is with micro-doses (one micro shot every single day).  What a lot of guys do is they'll blast themselves into supraphysiological range with a big dosage once a week, or a mega dose every two weeks even (insane), and then for the time between shots they'll be operating at suboptimal and unstable levels. Not low but it's not stable whatsoever and it leads to an increase in side effects, including hair shedding.  Back on track – I've realized these things on paper often don't really equate to how they work in real life application. For example, some guys have a certain affinity to miniaturize to different androgens at different levels than other guys. One actual real-life example: I have a handful of friends who are on Dutasteride because they need to be or else they'll shed from even TRT dosages of Testosterone. But for some reason, they can run Trenbolone and not lose their hair at all, which for a lot of guys would completely tear their hair to shreds. There are plenty of other examples of this where one guy will experience Androgenic Alopecia from a certain androgen, but then another androgen that’s just as androgenic on paper won’t give him any issues, even though someone else has the complete opposite experience with those same compounds. I believe there's an actual specific affinity for certain androgens that is individual specific based on your own genetic predispositions.   What I wanted to figure out was for me personally, do I have a higher affinity to miniaturize from MENT or a lower affinity than what I experience from Testosterone (the basis of my hormone replacement therapy). MENT has been looked at very seriously as a viable potential HRT alternative in the future, so obviously as someone who is obsessed with hair loss prevention, and is also on TRT, this interests me greatly. My MENT Experiment Protocol Even though MENT is very androgenic, if there was a conservative dosage that would equate to the same level of anabolic activity in my body, but with less of an androgen load than my TRT exhibits, or I simply didn't have an affinity to miniaturize from it for whatever reason, that's something I wanted to investigate. So, what I did was I stopped using my TRT and I replaced it with 70 milligrams of MENT per week, pinning 10 milligrams per day to keep blood serum concentrations as stable as humanly possible, while meticulously assessing my shedding. Nothing changed in my hair loss prevention protocol so I could assess what was going on accurately. Of course, I had to stop using RU58841 for this experiment to be accurate. I was already off the RU58841 for the first Dutasteride experiment, but I had to stay off of it to really assess what was going on at the androgen receptor and to see how the hair follicles respond to Trestolone. The reason I had to stay off of RU58841 is because if you have an anti-androgen competing to bind to the receptors with MENT, it's not going to be an accurate representation of what this androgen is actually doing on its own. Is MENT Hair Loss Safe? My Experiment Results As stated, I used 10 milligrams of MENT per day and assessed my shedding very, very closely. And what I concluded is that for me personally it's not hair safe at all. I do think milligram per milligram it is way stronger than Testosterone for sure. I noticed a bit of a boost in the gym, which indicated I could likely use a lower dosage still to replicate the same anabolic effects of 125mg of Testosterone. However, at that point, I didn't really want to continue to go as low as I could to see if I could get away with an even lower amount that would still replicate the anabolic activity of a 125 mg per week test dosage just because I could already tell there was significant shedding occurring. Take these results with a grain of salt, as this is for me personally, and it doesn't mean that it’s going to apply to every single person out there. For me personally, MENT is not something that I think I could see myself using long term. One thing I do like about it though, and one of the reasons I started this experiment in the first place is that it fulfills a lot of the physiological functions that Testosterone does because it also converts into Estrogen. I feel that a lot of guys don't realize that when it comes to potential hormone replacement therapy alternatives, often the compounds don't aromatize into Estrogen, so if someone were using a hormone replacement therapy alternative that doesn't aromatize into Estrogen, they would have zero Estrogen circulating in their system because there's simply nothing converting into Estrogen. A lack of Estrogen will cause significant health complications, including hair loss. I believe that a lot of the time theories going around about hormone replacement therapy alternatives aren't considering the fact that there would be more potential promising hormones to research if they were used in conjunction with exogenous Estrogen. E.G. I truly think certain SARMs could potentially be incorporated into a final solution to hair loss in many men, but they often go overlooked due to the fact that they don’t aromatize into Estrogen. In Conclusion I don't think that MENT/Trestolone is hair safe. That's for me personally, but just based on the fact that I'm fairly sensitive to hair loss from androgens I would bet that you'll probably experience the same thing as me if you are sensitive as well. Despite every one having their own individual specific affinities to miniaturize from certain androgens, typically the more androgenic a compound is, the harsher it will be on your hair (in general). That doesn’t apply in every scenario (as I outlined earlier), but it’s more often than not the case. I'll probably rule MENT out as a potential HRT alternative and TRT is still the go-to for me for the time being. Take my experiment results with a grain of salt, but I believe that it's a very androgenic compound that has a fairly high affinity to miniaturize hair follicles, even at what would probably be considered by most therapeutic dosages, if MENT had a therapeutic dosage for HRT purposes that is.

I’ve been following the Vertical Diet to a tee exactly how Stan would advise it, and was eating one pound of lean 90/10 ground bison per day, 4 eggs per day, long story short I was hitting all the diet goals outlined in the book relative to my body’s individual specific energy requirements for my current goals.

I had my first round of blood work done September 15th before I started the Vertical Diet.  September 15th my total cholesterol was 3.36 millimoles per liter, LDL cholesterol was 2.46 millimoles per liter. HDL was a bit in the toilet at 0.63 millimoles per liter. I needed that to go up and that was part of the reason why I was doing the Vertical Diet in the first place, in order to see if I could bring that number up. My triglycerides were okay, but HDL was too low. HDL needed to go up about 0.36 millimoles per liter to be acceptable by laboratory reference range standards. My diet was pretty much absent of dietary cholesterol prior to starting the Vertical Diet. Basically all I ate for protein prior to this diet was chicken, egg whites, Whey protein powder, stuff like that without any significant amount of saturated fat. My diet was very low in healthy fats too, so I was hoping I could bring that up with this diet. HDL is greatly affected by Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) so that's likely why mine is low in the first place. Hardcore supplementation with Citrus Bergamot and other supplements that would address that, as well as just living a healthy lifestyle, weren’t raising it to the extent that I needed either. That was one of the main goals of the Vertical Diet I outlined in my introduction to the log in week one. Obviously one thing that was concerning going into this diet was that there's a lot of preconceived notions about red meat and eggs and if they're bad or good for you. A lot of people assert that you will get plaque buildup in the arteries, high levels of inflammation, LDL will get cranked to the roof, etc. And others will claim there is no issue at all and all of that is untrue. I wanted to see for myself because there's a lot of people who have conflicting opinions on this. Whether they be vegans, carnivore dieters, paleo, keto, or even other people doing the Vertical Diet, there's a lot of people that seem to have strong opinions but haven't done bloodwork on themselves. Granted everyone has their own genetic predisposition, people with certain genes and alleles are just going to have high cholesterol via their own genetic predispositions, accompanied with their dietary choices. One guy who eats a certain amount of dietary cholesterol could have his blood values spike significantly just due to his genetics, and another guy could maintain perfect blood work eating like crap. I wanted to see what would happen in my own body because there's simply too many people giving out blanket statements of eggs and red meat are healthy, or red meat and eggs aren’t healthy. So, I wanted to see for myself. My Cholesterol Levels After Eating 1 Pound Of Red Meat And 4 Eggs Per Day I was eating a pound of grass-fed 90/10 lean ground bison per day and 4 eggs per day. These were the 2 foods I knew could significantly impact my blood work. As I mentioned, my LDL and total cholesterol were good prior to the diet. About 6 weeks later, I got bloods done again on October 27th and what came back was brutal.  My cholesterol basically doubled and went up to 4.77 millimoles per liter, and my LDL was 3.74 millimoles per liter. This is way too high obviously. I knew for a fact that something in my diet was causing this massive spike because I've never had cholesterol or LDL way out of range, even on supraphysiological amounts of anabolics in years prior. Also, my HDL only went up to 0.79, so it was still too low even with all these changes in my diet with all these new foods. A slight boost of HDL going up 0.16 millimoles per liter is nothing to write home about. Having my LDL and total cholesterol spike way up just to get a 0.16 boost in my HDL really wasn’t worth it. So, as it stood October 27th, my LDL and cholesterol were significantly out of range and they needed to come down. Was It The Red Meat Or The Eggs That Raised My Cholesterol And LDL? I wanted to see which foods were causing this spike specifically. I didn’t want to cut both the red meat and eggs out at the same time because at that point, you're basically sacrificing the accuracy of your assessment of what's going on. If you cut out both and everything fixes itself, how are you going to determine which of them was causing your issues in the first place. My plan was to drop all 4 of the eggs, but keep the 1 pound of red meat in my diet, and then get bloods done again a few weeks later. If my levels were still too high, I'd be able to tell exactly how much they went down (if any) from eliminating the eggs, and then I’d be able to cut out the red meat and then do another blood panel a few weeks later to see exactly how much the red meat affected my blood work as well. Eating Eggs Doubled My LDL And Total Cholesterol (Not Red Meat) November 20th, I had my blood work checked again. My doctor told me I need to wait several months to check my Cholesterol levels again accurately. I knew this was complete garbage information though as the body changes quickly when there are dietary changes. You work through these things pretty quick and if you make a significant change in your diet, it's going to be reflected in your blood work within weeks. You would think he would’ve clued in on this based on the fact that he had already seen my cholesterol double in a little over a month from introducing the eggs and red meat into my diet to begin with. I had my bloods done about three and a half weeks later, as I figured that was more than enough time. What happened was really interesting. As you know, I cut out all four eggs. That's the only thing that's changed in my diet. I’m still eating a pound of red meat a day at this point.  My cholesterol went down to 2.79 millimoles per liter, so that's now perfect. LDL went down to 1.7 millimoles per liter, which is better than it's ever been, and it's actually on the low end of the reference range now. HDL cholesterol only went down 0.02 to 0.77, which is a more than worthwhile tradeoff to get my total cholesterol and LDL down to optimal levels. Red Meat Inflammation – How Much Inflammation Did I Have From 1 Pound Per Day One of the main concerns when it comes to these types of foods, especially red meat, is potential inflammation. I was thinking okay, well, I'm cutting out the eggs and I'm getting bloods done anyways, which is going to be indicative of what red meat on its’ own does, so why don't I pay to get my c-reactive protein checked (the high sensitivity test is the one you’d want). So that’s what I did, I had a high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein test to see how much inflammation was in my body caused by eating 1 pound of red meat a day. Keep in mind this is high quality red meat; this is not McDonald's or other crap with trans fat and other garbage in it.  My C-Reactive Protein was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter. And when I say less than I mean their detection limit is 0.3. They couldn't even read my C-Reactive Protein because my inflammation was so low. Their reference range starts at 4.8, so if you have less than 4.8 then you're considered “healthy,” but obviously the lower the better. You don't want any inflammation in your body, as that's where heart disease, autoimmune conditions, cancer, and lots of other major health issues can stem from. That blood test result was big for me because I was really worried about the pound of red meat per day and I truly had no idea how that would impact my C-Reactive Protein, especially given all the sugar in this diet. As concerning as the red meat was the dextrose post-workout, orange juice shots throughout the day and the cranberry juice. Most people know that combining sugar with fats is one of the worst things you can do. Sugar in general is not healthy in any capacity. In my opinion, there’s a significant amount of sugar in the Vertical Diet, which was very concerning for me. One thing this set of blood work revealed to me though, and seems to be reinforced in various clinical studies is that if you're an athlete who trains hard and can make use of the sugar effectively, it's not nearly as unhealthy as it would be for somebody who's sedentary and is taking in that same amount of sugar. The sugar actually gets put to use to rebuild muscle tissue, shuttle nutrients, and replenish glycogen stores very quickly, and it doesn't seem to spill over into potentially causing health issues, based on my blood work at least. I can't say for certain whether it’s totally risk-free or not, but obviously having dextrose with fructose post-workout and having all these shots of sugar throughout the day were kind of a concern for me in combination with red meat, which on paper would be the ultimate combo for heart disease and major issues related to inflammation. But, much to my surprise, inflammation was not even detectable in my body in any capacity. So, that was a major relief because I was pretty concerned about that, and then the cholesterol completely correcting itself (and actually improving from my baseline blood work) was amazing. It completely fixed itself just by eliminating eggs. What I Learned From Weeks 7-14 What I concluded via those last three and a half weeks was that my body can't handle eggs. To be clear, that’s not me saying that you shouldn't eat eggs, but I do think you should get your own bloodwork to see how your body responds. It's pretty interesting to me that I can get away with eating all this red meat and it entirely came down to the eggs. It had nothing to do with the red meat at all, which is totally contrary to what most people would try and tell you. For me, 4 eggs per day literally doubled my LDL in weeks, and then eliminating them literally halved them in three weeks again. Changes In The Vertical Diet (For Me) Obviously, eggs are not going to be in my diet now. What am I doing to replace the nutrients I would normally get from the eggs? The choline, I get from my Nootropic formula Gorilla Mind Smooth, which has no stimulants in it.  It has 600 milligrams of Alpha-GPC per serving, which is enough to fulfill my daily choline needs. I added in a Selenium supplement, Vitamin K2 supplement (MK7 version), and a Biotin supplement as well. These supplements are all super cheap and bioavailable, so I wasn’t too concerned about removing eggs from my diet. It's not like the eggs were an integral part of hitting my daily nutritional requirements, so eliminating them wasn't too big of a blow to my overall quality of life because I can replace those physiological needs with very cheap supplements that are proven to work. It's been another 4 weeks since I had that blood work, and it's now week 15. Am I Still Following The Vertical Diet? I'm still following the Vertical Diet to a tee. The only thing that's changed is getting rid of the eggs, and as of more recent I've added in psyllium husk fiber because I want to hit my soluble fiber requirements. It hasn't hindered my digestion, if anything it has helped it. I guess this is going to be very individually specific food to add in because there are polar opposite opinions on fiber as well. Some people like fiber and claim it aids their digestion, and there are people that think fiber is the devil and wrecks digestion. For me personally, it's working well. How Do I Feel On The Vertical Diet After 14 Weeks I feel really good, I wake up in the morning and I'm way more rejuvenated than I would be otherwise prior to the diet. I feel a lot better in general honestly. Quality of life is up, energy levels are up, and my Thyroid is looking to be on the upswing. Thyroid Recovery Update I had an updated blood panel done.  My free T3 is at 3.59 picomoles per liter. In my opinion, that's not great but it's not bad. It’s a significant improvement from my last panel less than a month prior, which was on the brink of hypothyroidism. Ideally I would be at 5.0, which I will keep on working towards. My Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO antibodies), thyroglobulin antibodies (TG antibodies) and Reverse T3 looked ok, although the TPO antibodies should be lower. My TSH was also too high, and my Free T4 is low. The end goal is a TSH close to 1.0, and a Free T3 of 5.0 or higher, with nearly undetectable antibodies ideally as well. In Conclusion I'm pretty happy with everything so far. I think it should be noted though that you could have like significantly worsened blood work from the eggs in the Vertical Diet if you're prone like me to drastic changes in lipid profile. Especially if you're on TRT. Regardless if you’re eating eggs, not eating eggs, following the Vertical Diet, following a Vegan diet, following a Carnivore Diet, whatever it is, check your cholesterol levels consistently at least a couple times a year, get a full Hematology panel done, get your Thyroid panels done, get an EKG done, get an echocardiogram, get all your health markers checked. Your health isn’t something you want to mess around with, so just because some “expert” you saw on YouTube or on TV is telling you that something is healthy for you or unhealthy for you in a general context, double check your own blood work to confirm that before you dive in and adopt a diet long-term assuming it will work for you too. There are plenty of guys who can eat eggs and have perfect blood work. I am not one of those people. The same will likely apply for you in regards to some other food that you eat on a regular basis, or are considering adding in. Get your C-Reactive Protein checked too because inflammation is going to be one of the main pre-determining factors for potential health complications that could occur down the line cumulatively (heart disease, cancer, etc.). Just because some expert says eggs (or any other foods) are fine, that doesn't mean it is also going to be fine for you. So, keep tabs on your bloods.

Using these social media presences as inspiration creates an illusion that the ideal physique for men is 200 pounds diced as a minimum, and that men's physique competitors are likely the minimum level of muscularity necessary for a maxed out physique. While bodybuilding is seen as quite a bit more freakish over the past few years, the physique and classic physique categories are still widely regarded as the pinnacle of male physique development for attracting women. It’s pretty common for bodybuilders to justify their drug abuse, and criticize a non-competitive bodybuilder’s drug use that is only using steroids to improve their sexual appeal with the classic excuse: “You're doing it for the wrong reasons if you're doing it to get girls.” To me, that statement is absurd and I laugh every time I hear it come out of a bodybuilder’s mouth because there's no person who literally only takes drugs and abuses their body for this sport just for competing and nothing else. There are always the guys who say, “I just do it because I love it and I have to compete and it's how I make my living, so I have to use these drugs.” To me, this is so transparent and anybody with half a brain knows that even if these guys weren't making any money bodybuilding, they’d probably still be bodybuilding but just working a normal job too. Bodybuilders are bodybuilders because they love bodybuilding and enjoy building a huge, muscular and shredded physique. We all know that bodybuilders like the attention they get from their physique, let's not pretend otherwise. Do I think that you should only use anabolics for competitive purposes? No, I truly think that using them for 100% vain purposes is completely justified and anybody who says otherwise is lying to themselves, or just has different priorities than 99% of men on this planet. Getting back to the social media though, there's this misconception that you have to look like Sergi Constance, Chris Bumstead, or whoever your fitness idol is to be maxed out appearance wise. The reality is that fairly often, via attempting to get to that point you're just going to make yourself more unattractive then you would have if you didn’t push things into abusive territory. It takes a very minimal amount of drugs to actually achieve a physique that would be seen as ideal to women. In many cases (depending on your individual genetics), anabolics are not needed at all to achieve a maxed out physique in the eyes of women. The Ideal Physique For Attracting Women In the eyes of other men, good luck getting a physique we view as top tier naturally. To women though (luckily the gender that actually matters), 9/10 of them would WAY rather have a guy with a nice face and good head of hair that is an athletic looking 170 pounds over a 240 pound national competitor with a Norwood 4 hair line and an ugly bloated face despite being shredded (very common facial trait among bodybuilders). In pursuit of the ultimate classic physique body with anabolic steroids, you will more likely than not eventually have a choice put in front of you where you could gain another 10 pounds of muscle by increasing your dosages and doing a fat cycle of X, Y and Z, but the trade off would be permanently burning 5,000+ hairs off your head and adding another layer of tissue padding onto your face from all of the androgens you are going to be taking to do that. Now, when you think about this from a non-jaded third person perspective, what is going to actually make you more attractive of those two choices? If you thin the hell out of your hair because you had to take a hefty cycle of X, Y and Z to get to that next level physique, but then it thins out your hair line, did you really make yourself more attractive or less attractive? What if you got a bunch of acne from it, or if you prematurely aged your face? When you're in supraphysiological dosage range with anabolic androgenic steorids, you're going to prematurely age yourself with abusive dosages. If you look at any serious top level IFBB pro bodybuilder’s face in their 20’s, you’ll notice that they all coincidentally look to be a minimum of 10-20 years older than they actually are. You’ll see a picture of some massive bodybuilder and probably have the same question as most others: “How old is this guy? 40?” And then your jaw drops when you find out he’s actually 21 and it's the drugs that make him look like an old man.  Steroids “Anti-Aging” Effects – How They Actually Impact Your Facial Appearance Despite endogenously produced steroids being classified by some as “anti-aging” drugs, when they're taken in supraphysiological amounts you can actually prematurely age your skin. Every muscle in your body hyper responds when you take these drugs. This means that not only will they increase the amount of muscle you're going to build, but every contraction of these muscles is exaggerated as that muscle is far stronger than it would be otherwise. And when you're constantly creasing your face by making grimacing expressions in the gym, or simply raising your eye brows and making normal every day expressions during your day to day life, you will increase the probability of developing deep wrinkles. Go look at the average 30-year-old guy and go look at the average 30-year-old professional bodybuilder. Who looks older almost every single time? It's probably the bodybuilder. Now that's not to say that you shouldn't bodybuild, however, the point I’m trying to exemplify is that bodybuilders are often be blinded in their endless pursuit of muscle, and if you are doing this for aesthetic purposes, do not fall into this trap. It’s VERY easy to get carried away. The ideal physique to women is:  Lean and athletic (cut to 10% body fat and stay there with diet adherence)  If you don’t have enough muscle and are a rail, then you will have to bulk and cut a few times to get up to your genetic potential before sticking to a “shredded year round” focused plan   Chiseled face (accomplished by keeping drugs low and body fat low) No visible hair loss (keep androgens to a minimum, or none at all, plus have a prevention regimen in place)  If you’re too far gone already, look at hair systems or a hair transplant   Tall (If you’re under 6 foot 3, boost your height)  These are the general boxes you want to tick off, with complexion, hygiene, style, etc. all being things that will need to be perfected as well to max out your sex appeal. However, just from a general physique perspective, those are the main boxes you should focus on checking off. What If You Want To Take Androgenic Steroids Anyways? I'm not saying you're going to wreck your face if you take high dosages of anabolics, but I’m trying to illuminate the very real consequence of pushing things too far if aesthetics are the primary goal. If you're put in a position where you have to ask yourself “Okay, should I run Testosterone, Masteron and Trenbolone, but lose 25% of my hair over the next four months in order to get a bit better of a physique?” Often times when it comes to pure attraction, you would have been way better off just not taking it. There are more hair safe ways to go about getting to the top of the tier of men’s physiques (not on a bodybuilding stage) without having to go into that realm of abuse where you're likely making your appearance worse in order to gain stupid tons of muscle. No girl sees a gym rat as attractive who's 300 pounds, has his shaker cup with him, has his Otomix shoes on, is wearing a stringer as flimsy as an apron, as well as the rest of the cliché bodybuilder attire, is completely bald walking around and can barely breathe with high blood pressure. This just looks unhealthy and freakish, and no girl really wants this except a minority of niche fitness chicks. And even then, often times they'd prefer a guy who is athletic looking, very lean, and has a good looking face and head of hair. One thing you’ll notice once you get to heavily abusive territory with insane amounts of muscle that a lot of these bodybuilders look like they’re fat even when they're shredded. They have so much body mass in their face from the amount of muscle they've built there, and the amount of water retention that they hold in that tissue around their neck and face from all the drugs they're using to hold that supraphysiological amount of muscle. Barely a week after the Mr. Olympia contest these bodybuilders already look fat in clothes. Even when they’re ready to go on stage when they're in their sweaters backstage a lot of them don't even have that sucked in face look despite being 5% body fat and water depleted. They have fat looking faces, and it comes down to the amount of muscle they have, and the drugs.   If you get to a point where you're just hindering your facial aesthetics, your hair and your skin quality in order to get that next tier of muscle gain, that's where you should draw the line and that's where you're actually making negative progress when it comes to attracting the opposite sex, if that's why you're doing this in the first place. Natural Athlete Vs Bodybuilder Sex Appeal Just keep in mind a girl would way rather be with a guy who looks Cristiano Ronaldo, who's probably 175 pounds at 8 percent body fat versus a guy who's 230 pounds of pure muscle but is bald and has a ruined face. This is something I wish I realized a long time ago to be honest because it could have saved me a lot of hair. Fortunately, I've recovered a lot in the meantime, but if I could go back in time, I probably wouldn't have gone to the extreme that I did with some of this stuff. I figured this stuff out pretty early, but there are a lot of guys that get to a point where there's no turning back. They've burned all the hair off of their head; they have insane cardiovascular hypertrophy, high blood pressure, borderline renal failure, this and that. All these things that are potential consequences of drug abuse that only helped them on stage, but in every other aspect hindered their quality of life. To be blunt, you’re not going to do better with the opposite sex attempting to look like Mr. Olympia. In Conclusion You really don't need much. Trust me. If you do choose to use anabolics, I'd advise sticking with compounds that are far more selective for muscle than prostate, and avoiding heavy androgens and DHT derivatives like the plague. If you look like this guy for example, this would be the top 0.00001% and anything above and beyond this would almost certainly be considered overkill for most people.  This physique could be achieved naturally for those with great genetics, and for those with average or subpar genetics, it very likely wouldn’t require more than a very modest dosage of a mild anabolic.

Especially when it comes to why it occurs on a hormonal level, and the mechanism of action behind what is actually happening to your hair follicles. There has been a lie going around for years that DHT is the only hormone naturally produced in the body that can cause androgenic alopecia, and I decided to take it into my own hands and do an experiment on myself to prove that ALL androgens can miniaturize hair follicles, not just DHT.  The DHT Myth Today we're going to be talking about why DHT isn't the only cause of hair loss and why Testosterone also causes hair loss, as well as all other androgens in the world (for the most part). I don't know why this myth has enveloped the hair loss community to such a great extent where all anyone thinks is you have to kill DHT, you have to inhibit DHT, you have to lower DHT. As long as you get rid of DHT then you can't experience hair loss is what they’ll say. This is completely incorrect, and there's even guys out there they like Dr. Sam Robbins (I'm going to do a video reviewing his video series soon), talking about how increased Testosterone is good for hair loss.  It absolutely is not. And then there are guys talking about how high estrogen and chronically elevated prolactin levels are what causes Androgenic Alopecia like Christopher Walker.  This is just complete garbage misinformation. Women have high estrogen and minimal Testosterone. Consequently, they have minimal DHT levels as well. It’s not a coincidence that women keep their hair their entire life and men experience Androgenic Alopecia. Estrogen HELPS hair grow, and DHT AND Testosterone hinder it and expedite Androgenic Alopecia. This study assesses Testosterone's androgenicity irrespective of 5-alpha reduction to DHT: Prostatic involution in rats induced by a novel 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, SK&F 105657: role for testosterone in the androgenic response. “These results demonstrate that if the prostatic testosterone content is elevated to sufficient levels, androgenic effects are induced without a requirement for an elevation in prostatic DHT content. Thus, the conversion of testosterone to DHT appears to function as a means of amplifying androgenic stimulation in the prostate.” In other words, Testosterone also causes androgenic side effects, just to a lesser extent than DHT. DHT is several fold more androgenic than Testosterone and will be worse for your hair, however, Testosterone still has androgenic activity, can cause androgenic alopecia, and must be addressed as well. Quickly Dispelling Estrogen, Prolactin, Liver Damage, Thyroid Deficiency & Inflammation I go out of my way to test my prolactin, estrogen, liver enzymes, c-reactive protein (inflammation), get an extensive thyroid panel done, and several other important markers several times per year. Quite often (such as in the two videos above) you will have someone come out and claim that a certain hormone, value, or combination of things is chronically elevated in all individuals who experience male patten baldness and that is the root cause, rather than androgens leading to a cascade of events that cause miniaturization. As far as I've seen, I'm the only one who's actually getting blood work done prior to making any sort of claims on what is factual and what isn't. I can confidently state that elevated estrogen, prolactin, liver damage, systemic inflammation and thyroid deficiencies aren't the root of androgenic alopecia. With that being said, they can absolutely cause temporary shedding, but that is not to be confused with androgenic alopecia. Here you can see that all of those values are in range, and systemic inflammation was not even detectable in my blood.   Male Pattern Baldness In Women With PCOS Reveals Just How Much Androgens Affect Hair Loss Even if you're an old man and have Testosterone levels at the very bottom of the reference range, that does not mean whatsoever that you are immune to hair loss now that you have a lower amount of Testosterone. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age that results in more androgens being produced in the body than normal. Women with PCOS induce Male Pattern Baldness with Androgen levels still far lower than every single old man on earth. That in itself speaks volumes about how easily androgens can miniaturize hair follicles. Testosterone Levels In Those Affected By Male Pattern Baldness For your reference, these reference ranges are representative of roughly how much Testosterone men and women produce who are considered healthy.  So, you can already see how much more Testosterone men produce than women naturally. Now let’s take a look at the Testosterone levels of Women without PCOS, compared to women with PCOS:  The control group without PCOS had a mean Testosterone level of 36.9 ng/dL, while the women with PCOS had a mean Testosterone level of 92.4 ng/dL, with some women in the PCOS group having levels as high as 133 ng/dL. The control group without PCOS had a mean Free Androgen Index of 1.2, while the women with PCOS had a mean Free Androgen Index of 18.8, with some women in the PCOS group having a Free Androgen Index as high as 33. The control group without PCOS had a mean DHEA-S level of 130.9 µg/dL, while the women with PCOS had a mean DHEA-S level of 183.2 µg/dL, with some women in the PCOS group having levels as high as 263.50 µg/dL. While all these numbers are important, let’s look at the mechanism of action behind each of these hormones and how they contribute to eventual hair follicle miniaturization. How PCOS Causes Male Pattern Baldness In Women  A woman with PCOS who has a Testosterone level of somewhere around 92 ng/dL (roughly) can start experiencing androgenic effects from their androgen levels to such an extent that they develop masculine features like blatantly increased facial hair growth, and you guessed it, male pattern baldness. Male pattern baldness induction in women with Testosterone levels 3 times lower than a hormonally deficient male. Yes, it can happen, but it’s predicated upon androgen levels, namely Testosterone and DHT getting pushed up high enough to start this process. A Testosterone level of 92 ng/dL would leave the majority of men nearly asexual, feeling like crap, and they could STILL experience male pattern baldness even from that tiny amount of androgens. Hopefully this clarifies to all those skeptics that blood serum concentrations of Testosterone and DHT lower than what even a hormonally deficient old man would produce IS STILL enough of an androgen load to induce Male Pattern Baldness in those with high enough androgen sensitivity. Now, the question arises, how could one claim that Testosterone is contributing to male pattern baldness at all when the downstream mechanism of male pattern baldness occurs after Testosterone converts via 5α-Reductase to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)? That is exactly what this experiment was intended to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt. Why DHT Is Thought To Be The Only Androgen That Causes Hair Loss The myth circulating the community about DHT being the only androgen of concern started with the examination of the mechanism of action of the male primary sex hormone Testosterone converting via 5α-Reductase to the byproduct androgen DHT (Dihydrotestosterone). DHT is several-fold more androgenic than Testosterone, which is why it is responsible for prostate enlargement, body and facial hair growth, among all of the other typical androgenic side effects, including male pattern baldness. Hair loss caused by DHT is Androgenic Alopecia (the miniaturization of hair follicles), NOT to be confused with shedding, which is temporary loss induced by factors that can be reversed like nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, Thyroid deficiency, etc. Permanent miniaturization of hair follicles is androgen related, and DHT is thought to be the cause of that. This is why doctors prescribe guys with prostate issues (an androgenic side effect) 5α-Reductase inhibiting drugs like Finasteride and Dutasteride, but then also prescribe them for hair loss prevention. Androgens affect prostate just like they also affect your hair. Most people know that. That's rudimentary beginner knowledge, and every one thinks “Okay, well, as long as I get rid of the DHT systemically with one of these drugs or I inhibit it topically then I can prevent hair loss” and that's the end of the research for most guys. And then some guys who dig a bit deeper start to question some pretty far fetched things and just rub an array of things on their scalps assuming that they have some sort of localized nutrient or circulation deficiency that can be solved with an array of random vitamin mixtures or herbs. Putting Testosterone Vs DHT In Perspective If you actually look at it from a logical perspective, DHT supposedly miniaturizes hair follicles because it's several fold more androgenic than Testosterone. But when you inhibit the conversion to DHT via inhibiting 5α-Reductase with Finasteride or Dutasteride what happens to your Testosterone? There is far less Testosterone > DHT conversion occurring in the body, so now you actually have INCREASED Testosterone levels. And even if it was still converting to DHT you still have a substantial amount of Testosterone circulating in your system, right? Let’s take a closer look at what Testosterone literally is. Is this not also an Anabolic ANDROGENIC Steroid? It is. It's an AAS. That means it still has an ability to affect androgen sensitive tissue. Testosterone’s Selectivity For Muscle Tissue To Prostate (Anabolic : Androgenic Activity) Itself Proves It Causes Hair Loss If you look at the selectivity of muscle to prostate in the clinical studies done over the years, you'll find that Testosterone exhibits a two to one selectivity of muscle tissue to prostate.   What can you extrapolate from that data? First of all, you can clearly see that Testosterone on its own increases prostate size in a dose dependent manner, exhibiting blatant androgenic activity. You can also extrapolate the fact that it's not highly selective for muscle to prostate, so it will undoubtedly have an androgenic effect in the human body at a therapeutic dose for men (the amount they naturally endogenously produce). Now, while Testosterone exhibits a 2-fold selectivity for muscle to prostate, it must be noted that DHT is several times that. Does the Testosterone circulating in your system affect your hair to the same extent as DHT? Not even close, BUT, it still can exert androgenic side effects, including hair follicle miniaturization (the point of the article). If you're a highly sensitive individual with a high affinity to miniaturize via androgens, you can expect that despite being on Dutasteride and systemically crushing your DHT, you can still lose your hair from the free Testosterone wreaking havoc on your scalp. This is why Finasteride and Dutasteride work so well for some guys, and for others it only seems to work periodically, and for other highly sensitive individuals (who are also extremely sensitive to Testosterone), it doesn’t work at all. Anything that systemically lowers DHT or blocks the expression of DHT via receptors still doesn’t take care of all of this unaccounted for Testosterone circulating in your system, which has a very androgenic effect on your body. This is why any girl who takes any sort of steroid whatsoever that doesn't have a very, very, very low androgen rating experiences masculinization, because these things affect your entire body at a systemic level via androgen side effects. Testosterone Is Also An Anabolic ANDROGENIC Steroid – Therefore It Exacerbates Male Pattern Baldness Most you guys know I'm on TRT – Testosterone Replacement Therapy. My dosage is 150 milligrams per week. This puts me at high-normal/borderline supraphysiological Testosterone levels. This amount would normally make me lose my hair and progress my androgenic alopecia. How I've been able to combat it these years is mainly with Ketoconazole shampoo and the topical anti-androgen RU58841. I've also used other things to stimulate supraphysiological growth like Ibutamoren, but those have nothing to do with DHT or preventing further loss, that was accomplished via the anti-androgens. Figuring out how to prevent androgens from miniaturizing hair follicles was my main concern, and it should be yours too, hence why Minoxidil only protocols are almost undoubtedly going to fail in the long run. The first step in this puzzle is accepting the perspective of looking at all androgens when it comes to hair loss prevention, not just DHT. If Testosterone also miniaturizes hair follicles which is an anabolic androgenic steroid, why do you think it is that when a bodybuilder takes Dianabol, or they take Anadrol, or they take Trenbolone, or they take any of these other anabolic androgenic steroids they lose their hair if they're prone to male pattern baldness? They take (insert steroid name here), it doesn't matter if it's DHT derivative or not, there's plenty of steroids that aren't DHT derivatives that blatantly make you lose your hair. A good example of that is MENT (Trestolone), which does not get 5 alpha-reduced due to steric hindrance from the 7 alpha-methyl group, and still expedites androgenic alopecia. Regardless of how potent a steroid is and the hair loss risk associated with it, you have to question flat out, what do all of these drugs have in common? They're all androgens, therefore they will all have an androgenic effect on the human body. The extent to which they do this varies but the commonality between all of them is they're all anabolic androgenic steroids, and will ALL have a dose-dependent androgen response in the body.  Basically, if you take enough of any anabolic androgenic steroid, you can induce prostate growth, you can miniaturize hair follicles, you can induce facial hair growth, you can induce any androgenic side effect associated with anabolic androgenic steroids, which should be every one’s logical conclusion when researching about hair loss prevention. Androgenic Side Effects Even While Taking Dutasteride Have you ever questioned how a guy on Dutasteride who’s systemically crushed his DHT to castration levels still grows facial hair? How is it that he still builds far more muscle than a female? How is it that he still accomplishes anything that's related to anabolic androgenic steroids? It's because he still has Testosterone circulating in his system. If you literally have zero DHT, but still grow facial hair, how could you not ask yourself “Well, if I have this androgenic side-effect (facial hair growth) then why would other androgenic side-effects (like hair loss) not occur?” The answer, you STILL have androgens in your system, it's the endogenous Testosterone. The Testosterone is causing androgenic effects in the body, including miniaturization of hair follicles. If you took a bunch of Trenbolone do you think your hair is not going to fall out? It will because it's an androgen. Anything that's an androgen is going to miniaturize hair follicles relative to your own genetic androgen sensitivity and Testosterone is not exempt from this fact. My Experiment – Blood Work Proof That Testosterone Also Causes Male Pattern Baldness I feel like by now you already get the underlying message of this article, but I wanted to take it a step further. Most of you guys know I'm on TRT like I mentioned. A dose that would otherwise make me lose my hair and has in the past as you can see here:  I've experienced pretty bad hair loss in the past. How was I going to prove that Testosterone also causes hair loss via my own blood work? Anytime Testosterone involved androgenic activity is involved, the immediate assumption is that the reason that activity occurred is because of the DHT (the byproduct metabolite deriving from Testosterone), and not the Testosterone itself as well. I needed to isolate this variable in myself so I could accurately assess just how androgenic Testosterone is. I already knew it could cause hair loss on its own, but regurgitating theory only goes so far without legitimate unbiased blood work. My History With RU58841 As A Topical Anti-Androgen As you may or may not know, RU58841 is a topical anti-androgen intended to selectively bind to androgen receptors and basically inhibit the androgens circulating in your system from binding to and miniaturizing hair follicles. The whole point of it is to essentially block androgens from binding and having that miniaturizing effect. But because it's localized to the scalp as a topical it has a much lower incidence of systemic side effects. In the RU58841 studies it was actually shown to have no systemic side effects at all, while simultaneously outperforming Finasteride in hair loss prevention. Effects Of Topical Antiandrogen And 5-Alpha-Reductase Inhibitors On Sebaceous Glands In Male Fuzzy Rats.  Evaluation of RU58841 As An Anti-Androgen In Prostate PC3 Cells And A Topical Anti-Alopecia Agent In The Bald Scalp Of Stumptailed Macaques.  Over the past year or so as way more people have started experimenting with it, I’ve heard of some rare cases of systemic side effects. My theory is that this minority of individuals are either borderline hormonally deficient in androgens to begin with (very rarely does anyone actually get elaborate baseline blood work so I can’t say for certain), have increased skin permeability and/or dermaroll and encourage it to go systemic, or a variety of other factors that would ultimately influence if the compound absorbs systemically too significantly. For me personally, I have had no side effects from it at all, and my blood work and my EKG results have all come back perfect even after 4 years of using it, so it's always been my candidate of choice when it comes to inhibiting androgens topically at the hair follicles. Fortunately, because it binds to the receptor and blocks all androgens from binding (not just DHT) it's been able to combat DHT and Testosterone to a great extent. How Much Does Dutasteride Lower DHT? So, how was I going to isolate Testosterone as a variable to assess just how bad it is for my hair in particular when some of it will undoubtedly convert to DHT. What I did was I started taking Dutasteride 0.5 milligrams per day. As you probably already know, Dutasteride inhibits almost all of your systemic DHT. This is dose dependent but for the average male a 0.5 mg dosage of Dutasteride per day will at least wipe out 90% of systemic DHT, and it can get as high as 99% inhibition. Higher dosages nearly ensure this as well (I stuck with only 0.5 mg as I had never used it before). My first part of this experiment was actually meant to see how much Dutasteride could actually inhibit Testosterone to DHT conversion, because everyone knows Dutasteride can inhibit 90% – 99% of your DHT, but very rarely does anyone actually get blood work done to see exactly how much residual DHT they have left that could still be causing problems. What I wanted to see personally is if somebody who's using an exogenous source of Testosterone to reach a supraphysiological blood serum concentration of androgens would still experience the same degree of inhibition from Dutasteride at the 5α-Reductase enzyme as a normal non-enhanced male who is just operating with their own endogenous production of Testosterone. All of Dutasteride’s data is based off of natural non-enhanced hormonal profiles, and I’m a bodybuilder at heart so I wanted to see exactly how much Dutasteride could push things, while simultaneously also completing some very insightful research for the hair loss community. I pushed my TRT up to 200 milligrams per week temporarily for the experiment. I knew this would push me into the supraphysiological range getting my total Testosterone closer to 2000 ng/dL. No natural human being can achieve a Testosterone level this high. I also knew that this dose would make me shed, as I have a VERY tightly regulated androgen threshold that I know I can't really cross without progressing my androgenic alopecia. Basically, the first part of the experiment was to see if I pushed my Testosterone up way past what any of these studies would be looking at, would the 5α-Reductase enzyme still be inhibited to the same extent as the drug claims it is even in the presence of a supraphysiological amount of Testosterone trying to push its way through that 5-AR into DHT. I paid about $200 to get this blood test done, because obviously it's not really something you can just go tell your doctor you want done and have them agree that it’s a medical necessity. It's a funny story actually, when I went to go ask my doctor if I could get my DHT tested to see if the Dutasteride was working properly, he told me to check my Testosterone levels because he said that Finasteride and Dutasteride lower Testosterone, which we all know is not the case at all. If you look at the Merck official brochure it clearly states that Finasteride increases Testosterone and Estrogen by approximately 15%.  It’s just another funny example of doctors trying to tell me incorrect information, but I digress. The reference range of Dihydrotestosterone in the average natural non-enhanced male is 16-79 ng/dL give or take depending on the lab you get your blood tested at.  Keep in mind as your read on that this reference range is referring to the average natural male, AKA somebody who has a normal Testosterone level and however much DHT they would have without taking any Steroids whatsoever. The natural range for men is 16-79 ng/dL. Obviously you would expect if you were on a supraphysiological dose of exogenous Testosterone your DHT would probably be in the 100’s (at least) for sure. Unless you have some sort of enzyme abnormality or genetic defect at the 5α-Reductase enzyme or something along those lines of course, but I do not. I took 0.5 milligrams of Dutasteride every day for several months on a supraphysiological dose of Testosterone and then got my blood work done. The results came back about a month later because this is not a very common test, so they had to send it to another country to get tested. The results came back, and my DHT was not even readable on the blood work.  It was under 5 ng/dL. When your blood work is marked with an “A” it means it was an abnormal result because you weren’t in the natural reference range, and the “<” less than symbol means that not only are the levels low, but they can't even be read because they’re so low. Their detection limit is 5 ng/dL, and anything under that they can’t measure. So my DHT levels are somewhere under 5 ng/dL on 0.5 mg of Dutasteride per day while on a supraphysiological dosage of Testosterone. A DHT level this low is literally the equivalent of castration levels. To put this in perspective, my DHT levels are so low that they are even lower than what a normal woman would produce. I’d be considered DHT deficient even if I was a female. Here are another lab’s reference ranges that show what they consider to be healthy DHT levels for men and women respectively:  As you can see, I’m well below the reference range for men, and even below the reference range for women. Someone with this low of a DHT level (literally next to 0) would not be able to shed/have any miniaturization from DHT because there's simply no DHT circulating in their system. So we’ve established that the Dutasteride crashed my DHT into literal nothingness, now what? Remember, Dutasteride also increases the amount of free Testosterone circulating in your system AND I already have a supraphysiological amount in my system from the exogenous Testosterone I am administering. We already know that, it's been established. Now all that’s left would be to topically inhibit the remaining androgens (the Testosterone) from binding and miniaturizing hair follicles to completely halt male pattern baldness, which I typically accomplish to a fair extent with RU58841. At this point, the only androgen circulating in my system with DHT totally out of the equation is about 2000 ng/dL of Testosterone. So, now that part 1 of the experiment was over, it was time to see just how much Testosterone can progress my Androgenic Alopecia with a complete absence of DHT in my body. I dropped the RU58841 I had been using for nearly 4 years as part 2 of the experiment. RU58841 has a very short half-life, so it is out of the system very quickly. I got rid of the RU, and now at this point of the experiment I'm just operating with 200 mg of Testosterone per week, and my daily dosage of 0.5 mg of Dutasteride. I have zero DHT, all I have is a supraphysiological amount of Testosterone in my system now, and NO topical protection from the Testosterone in my body. Anything that happened from that point onward was predicated entirely upon whatever could happen at a systemic level from the androgenic side effects caused by Testosterone only. The Results From Very High Testosterone And 0 DHT Unsurprisingly, it didn’t take long for my shedding to start up again.  My shedding spiked to 50-100 hairs per day in my hair catcher in the shower. When everything is aligned for me I literally lose 5-10 hairs in the shower at most. To clarify, it is normal to lose up to 100 hairs per day simply due to the natural hair life cycle, but this was just in the shower, not accounting for the rest of the hair that falls out going about my day, lying in bed, etc. Anyone who monitors shedding amounts in the shower as a reference point would agree that 100 hairs in the shower drain every day is excessive and very likely indicates a regression in hair loss prevention. My rate of loss had exceeded my rate of growth for the first time in years simply due to increasing my Testosterone, even with a complete absence of any DHT in my entire body. My Experiment Conclusions What did I want to assess via this entire endeavour? I shouldn't have even had to prove this because anyone who knows how androgens work in the first place would know if you jab yourself in the butt with a bunch of Trenbolone you're going to lose your hair. Why? Because it's an androgen. If you check the anabolic to androgenic rating of Testosterone you can see that it's 100 : 100 If you read the studies detailing how selective it is for muscle to prostate you will note that it still affects prostate size in a dose dependent manner, and is not very selective after all. Therefore it still exerts significant androgenic side effects from the amount males endogenously produce. Androgenic Side Effects With Zero DHT I still grow facial hair, body hair on my chest, stomach, back and legs at a quick rate despite having zero DHT. The fact that I still have to shave even with zero DHT is pretty indicative of what’s going on at a systemic level. I actually noticed my back hair stopped growing as much though. The lower half of my back, which is usually just as hairy as the top half now grows almost no hair. Obviously, there is a definite correlation there, as DHT is way more androgenic than Testosterone, so as you’d expect from androgens, the more that are in your body, the more body hair you will grow, and the more hair you will lose on your head, and vice-versa for a reduction in systemic androgens. Hence women having minimal body hair, and keeping the hair on their head. This is also the reason why transgender women (men transitioning to women) greatly reduce the amount of body hair they grow and coincidentally also reverse male pattern baldness to a large extent when they crush their systemic androgen levels to female levels (both Testosterone and DHT) with oral estrogen and anti-androgens. It's all correlated. So, with my DHT going down to 0 I did notice a slight reduction in androgenic effects in my body (hence the reduced back hair), which is expected as DHT is several fold more androgenic than Testosterone as mentioned, however, I'm still experiencing significant androgenic effects in my system from the Testosterone, otherwise I would have no facial hair or body hair whatsoever. If my androgen load was truly 0 as most would claim is the result of having 0 DHT, then it would theoretically be impossible for me to experience any androgenic effects in my body. If DHT were the only hormone in the body capable of inducing androgenic alopecia, then without it I would have no back hair whatsoever. I would have no hair on my chest; I would have no hair anywhere except on my head. My DHT levels on Dutasteride are literally lower than a female, and yet I still blatantly have huge amounts of androgenic activity in my body, otherwise I wouldn’t have to shave my overgrown body hair once a week still and shave my face every other day. Accounting For All Androgens In A Hair Loss Prevention Protocol As you can gather by now, Testosterone also causes hair loss (androgenic alopecia/male pattern baldness). It contributes to the miniaturization of hair follicles period, just to a far lesser extent than DHT, as its significantly less androgenic. You need to account for this though when you use a 5α-Reductase inhibitor and assume you are covered. You’re not, if you have a high enough sensitivity to androgens that Testosterone also causes miniaturization, you will eventually start losing ground again, or the 5α-Reductase inhibitor may never work for you in the first place as there is all of this free Testosterone in your body still wreaking havoc on your hair follicles. This explains why some guys are seemingly Finasteride/Dutasteride non-responders. Not to mention that Finasteride leaves 30% of your systemic DHT in tact that can also still cause damage. Does this mean that every one should be using Dutasteride, RU58841, systemic anti-androgens, or any other crazy new experimental chemicals? No it doesn’t, but I’m just trying to explain how this scenario unfolds so you can more accurately assess your own personal hair loss, interpret your blood work, and figure out what the best course of action is for you personally. There’s nothing worse than being told to take (insert drug name here), taking it and putting yourself at risk of side effects, and then still watching your hair loss progression worsen because you don’t fully understand what’s going on in your body. To take control of the situation, you need to know this process inside out, and then formulate a plan of attack from a well researched stance, or not if you just choose to let nature take its course as well. Hair systems look great nowadays and I would not hesitate to say that for some guys getting a great hair system is a far better option than taking a bunch of drugs if you are prone to side effects. Is Your Hair Loss Caused By A Deficiency, Stress, Or Androgens? Whenever a guy starts experiencing blatant male pattern baldness, 99% of the time it's related to androgens. Whether you think it's some special vitamin deficiency, stress, Thyroid deficiency, autoimmune disease, allergen, etc. it’s almost always androgen related. I’m not saying those things don’t happen, they definitely do, but you have to realize that those all cause shedding, not actual miniaturization of hair follicles. Anything that causes temporary shedding would reverse itself once it is addressed and rectified, whereas with androgenic alopecia, that’s the one we are mainly concerned with as that’s what causes permanent loss, and it’s almost always the root cause of a male hair loss issue. Growth Agonists Vs Anti-Androgens And Inhibitors There are certain things that can improve the growth rate and the health of your hair which I'm not opposed to whatsoever. Things like Minoxidil, Ibutamoren, PRP injections, Dermarolling, etc. These kind of things work by increasing density, increasing the speed at which hair grows, increasing the lifespan of it to increase how healthy it looks, etc. These are all things you need to take into account as well, but you have to understand too that growth stimulators are basically bandaids that offset the real issue. It's basically a balancing act and people are focusing on things like herbs for scalp health, and ways to improve their growth rate. That’s cool but when you only focus on that all you're doing is maximizing your rate of growth relative to your rate of loss. The ideal thing you want to do is get your rate of loss to zero, and then focus on boosting your rate of growth afterwards, and then that's where you have the perfect formula for getting back a perfect hairline. But until you've got that rate of loss down to zero by addressing the androgen issue, your rate of growth no matter how high you push it with these stimulators will eventually be a net negative and result in loss of ground. If your rate of growth is better than your rate of loss it's going to equate to greater density in the short-term and appear to be offsetting your hair loss, but it's a balancing act and you're fighting an uphill battle. It's like trying to canoe upstream against the current. You want to get the current to completely calm first (reduce androgen induced loss to zero) and then go up the stream. At least that’s the ideal way to do it if you prioritize hair loss prevention over everything else, obviously every one has their own tolerance to what lengths they are willing to go to in order to accomplish that. That's my view on it anyways, because otherwise you're just fighting uphill the entire time and will eventually lose ground. If you're actually sensitive and have an affinity to miniaturize, which you more than likely do if you’re using growth stimulators in the first place, you can only offset androgen miniaturization for so long. This is exactly why most guys who only use Minoxidil can hold up pretty well for a while (unless they're very androgen sensitive), but eventually, things kind of hit a sticking point where it's all caught up with them and their Minoxidil dependent hairs they’ve grown are no longer able offset the loss of density from the androgen affected hairs that have continued to fall out. You can only grow those so healthy and so long and you can't grow a full head of hair of new Minoxidil dependent hair from just the Minoxidil. You still have all of this hair that's still affected by androgens that you want to try and save. You can't just offset density loss with growth stimulators and make it to 80 years old with a perfect hairline. It's not going to happen. The only way you can do that is by addressing androgens as a whole. In Conclusion I've been looking at a lot of new research lately and this blood work was really revealing because it exposed what I suspected all along. There are “experts” on the internet talking about how high Testosterone is good for male pattern baldness, and that DHT is the only androgen that can cause hair loss, or that high estrogen is bad and is the root of men’s hair loss. No, these guys are just trying to sell a product, or they just don't know what they're talking about because at the end of the day that is simply not true. Estrogen is beneficial for hair growth and Testosterone is going to contribute to the miniaturization of your hair follicles. Anything aside from androgens, if you have a nutritional deficiency, if you have a hormonal imbalance, if you have some sort of systemic reaction or an allergen in your diet, or you have some autoimmune disease, these things all cause shedding. Temporary shedding is not androgenic alopecia. If you have a biotin deficiency, it's not androgenic alopecia (permanent loss). Once you replenish and fix that deficiency everything comes back. If you get chemotherapy treatment for cancer and you lose your hair, that's not permanent loss. That's drug-induced temporary shedding. Remember, it’s literally called ANDROGENIC Alopecia. It's not called DHT Alopecia. That should have been the first clue for most of us. Anyways, I have a lot more content to come on this subject and I'm going to dive into this process from start to finish and elaborate on exactly what you need to know when it comes to hair loss prevention, and do my best to dispel the myths and poor information circulating out there. There were some great questions that were posted in the comments section of the YouTube video that I felt were valuable additions to this article that I have included below for your reference if you are interested. FAQ Why Am I Still Experiencing Gyno On Dutasteride If My Estrogen Is In Range? Question: hey bro, this is litteraly the most interesting video of youtube! you are a damn khowlege machine! Are you still on duta ? Did you measure your oestradiol level while on duta+200 mg test per week? You didn't need an AI to avoid gyno? I might be ultra sensitive to gyno and hair loss, because even with Finasteride i keep losing my hair so I have added duta 5 month ago. However even if my E2 level is only 25pg/ml i experienced bad gyno with duta… My DHT level was like yours unreadable. Do you know why I am experiencing gyno? And i will link you a study of 1996 by imperio did on the pseudo hermaprhodite( the dude with 5α-Reductase defiencicy), which showed that they had low DHT level but really high test level, and no hair loss and body hair. Derek: My E2 is in range at all times without an AI at therapeutic dosages, even up to 200 mg per week. This is largely due to my administration frequency, as well as my diet and body composition. DHT antagonizes Estrogen and helps alleviate issues that may otherwise be present at receptor binding sites in breast tissue. Without DHT present, it's a lot easier to get gyno. Your issue could be an imbalance of Test:Estro, it could also be prolactin related (unlikely, but worth getting bloods to look at), it could be a variety of things, but I'd need to see comprehensive bloods to make a more accurate assessment. Just because one guy has high test in his system and doesn't lose his hair, it doesn't mean Testosterone doesn't miniaturize hair follicles. That was one specific case, and as proved several times, 5α-Reductase inhibitors prove to be sufficient for halting hair loss in a fairly significant portion of individuals. However, for many others, it isn't, and this is because those individuals have an affinity to miniaturize from androgens that exhibit a far lesser androgenic profile. I have seen numerous occasions (including my own experiment) where guys on Dutast with zero DHT still lose hair whenever a high amount of Testosterone is in their system. Some individuals I know are even able to run other AAS with no issues, but whenever they run Testosterone (even on a 5α-Reductase inhibitor) they start progressing their MPB again. Prolactin, Estrogen, Cortisol and Liver Damage The True Cause Of Androgenic Alopecia? Question: Have you reviewed this guy’s book? It is well documented. Prolactin, estrogen/cortisol, and issues with the liver is his thesis for MPB. Women are protected against it bc of Progesterone. What do a lot of steroids do? They fuck with your liver if theyre an oral or Tren raises prolactin. Dbol etc. increase estrogen. and fucks up your liver. Why do some people lose major hair on things like Accutane? It fucks your liver up. A couple issues with your experiment: 1) There is a shedding phase with the Dutasteride / Finasteride. 2) I could show you many examples of people with low T that have male pattern baldness. I had levels at or around 300 and was receding in my mid-20s and had a bald patch in the back of my head growing in. So now we have to go into the “sensitivity” argument which science can't seem to tell who is sensitive and who is not. It makes little sense. 3) It might have been a good idea to show your Prolactin and Estrogen levels. That book I sent you has recommended levels for these. Including thyroid levels in the blood. Sorry but there's some more work to be done before definitively you can say that this is the reason. Post your complete blood work. Derek: 1) I ran this experiment long enough so the shedding phase was accounted for. Cumulatively it was several months. I should have been more specific. I knew going into this I would need to stick with it for a while to get an accurate assessment. 2) Women have minimal Testosterone. None are experiencing AA except the ones that experience a systemic increase in androgen load. The ones with loss via other mechanisms are experiencing temporary shedding and it would be corrected via addressing the root (hypothyroidism, autoimmune disease, hormonal imbalance whatever it may be). 300 ng/dL is not low. That's low for a male. The point is that any amount of Testosterone is androgenic enough to miniaturize follicles in those with an affinity to miniaturize hair follicles via that specific androgen. Did you still have facial hair with 300 ng/dL? Yes, I bet you did. Hence you still experienced androgenic side effects from the Testosterone. Transgenders who transition from M>F use systemic anti-androgens and estrogen to intentionally crash their Testosterone to near zero. What is the result? A reversal of MPB to a large extent. 300 ng/dL is more than enough to cause androgenic sides, hence it is enough to also cause androgenic sides on your hair if you are sensitive. If a girl took enough Testosterone to get her up to 300 ng/dL she would develop male characteristics, grow facial hair, and also start MPB (if she had a high affinity). 3) Mine are perfect. My liver is also perfect. I'll post them in another video then. *I edited them into this article as you can’t edit a video after posting it obviously*   I don't drink or use methylated orals ever, nor am I on Accutane. The liver is pretty resistant and is rarely an issue except when guys abuse themselves with alcohol or toxic compounds. I don't know why you're asking me about why people lose hair on Accutane. It dries out skin and is liver toxic, nobody is arguing that that wouldn't cause a shed. I've already addressed this, shedding is not the same as androgenic alopecia. Most smart bodybuilders will literally go out of their way to ensure all of these values are manually kept in range (if you're natural it's unlikely that these are out of range to begin with), and to assert that the reason anybody is experiencing permanent miniaturization via these two hormones or liver toxicity seems insane to me. Bodybuilders are the perfect representation of what happens when you exert a supraphysiological amount of androgens on yourself (including Testosterone), and they will manually keep their Estrogen, Prolactin and liver enzymes in range with this supraphysiological amount of androgens in their system. Those that are prone still go bald just the same, as does the rest of the male population. Women have sky high Estrogen, and it helps hair growth. If a guy elevated his Estrogen to those levels he would get gyno, and develop feminine features. I'm assuming the book doesn't suggest that. Prolactin, Estrogen, and Thyroid levels are all things that can cause temporary shedding. Shedding is not androgenic alopecia. Androgenic Alopecia is the permanent miniaturization of hair follicles and is only accomplished via androgens. If you have Hypothyroidism, you will shed. That shedding would stop after you get your Thyroid levels addressed, and normal hair growth would ensue afterwards. The same goes for any hormonal fluctuation that is not an androgen. With all that said, I will read it and do a video on it if I feel the arguments in it are sound. Why Do Young Men Have Great Hair And Old Men Don’t When Testosterone Levels Are Highest In Young Men? Question: @More Plates More Dates Thanks for your reply. I reposted the PDF of the book (it's free). There is a video presentation that goes along with it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVq9XD0Ydzo&list=PLpZFoPXjEZQkEcKBXgzHnNUIpNgWmtgKq It would be interesting to hear your review on this – it is making the rounds. A few things: One question I want to pose to you is this: if androgens are the cause of hair loss, why don't we see males in their prime years 16-19 when Testosterone levels the highest go bald? We usually see men go bald when they are older and Testosterone levels are lower. I still had existing facial hair because the follicles were still there but I will say this – my bear did not grow in as thick, it was patchy. The follicle didn't get miniaturized. Your responses are logical conclusions but I would like to hear your review on this — it is an interesting read nonetheless. Derek: I'll watch that too thanks. Your questions: 1) Because they still have all 100,000 hair follicles immaculate and untouched on their head. They literally just went through puberty and just initiated the miniaturization process. You don't immediately lose 50K hairs off your head, it takes years of miniaturization to notice diffuse thinning or recession, and by the time you do, you have already lost 20-30%+ density. I address that entirely in this video:  2) Transgender M>F lose most of their facial hair when they crash their Test to near zero. If you could grow/maintain a blatant beard at all, it's because of the androgens in your system. If your Test suddenly dropped under 300 ng/dL, your beard would have become even more sparse/patchy/less hair overall (less androgenic), due to the reduction in androgens in your system, and you would have had less androgenic activity on your scalp as well. Your prostate also would have gone down in size. It's all correlated. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5418958/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367483/ Commenter Claims That Steroids That Convert To DHT Or DHT Derivatives Are The Only Androgens That Can Cause Hair Loss Question: Tren causes hairloss because it is also converted by 5a reductase to a DHT derivative. The tren itself will have a negligible effect on hairloss just as testosterone itself. This is basic knowledge and you don't have to “prove” it with your silly “science”. Btw how the **** do you count hairs? Derek: Trenbolone does not convert via 5-alpha reductase into a DHT derivative. Here is a study that looks at this specifically -“Recently, we demonstrated that trenbolone (a potent synthetic testosterone analogue that is not a substrate for 5-alpha reductase or for aromatase)” – https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928725 Another example: MENT (Trestolone) is not 5α-reduced into a more androgenic metabolite, and neither do countless other androgens that miniaturize hair follicles. “7 alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT) does not get 5 alpha-reduced due to steric hindrance from the 7 alpha-methyl group. Therefore, the androgenic potency of MENT is not amplified as happens with testosterone.” – https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7626464 All AAS (even SARMs) increase in androgenicity in a dose dependent manner, and therefore exhibit greater potential to miniaturize hair follicles the less selective they are, and the higher the blood serum concentration/dose is. You can count hairs with a hair catcher. That's how I assess changes rather than wait for obvious visual regression.

    "content": "My Cholesterol Skyrocketed From Eggs And Red Meat!? | Vertical Diet Week 4-6 Update     To get straight to the point, I had blood work done in week 5 and my Thyroid is worse than it was at baseline before starting the Vertical Diet 5 weeks prior, and my cholesterol levels are horrible (my LDL and total cholesterol level was healthy at baseline). I also had an electrocardiogram (EKG) to measure my heart's electrical activity. Is the diet responsible for the Thyroid downregulation? No it’s not. I likely would be deficient right now if it weren’t for the iodine and other metabolic stimulation mechanisms in the diet. However, the lipid profile I believe is directly caused by the diet, and because of this, some adjustments will need to be made. Now, to give you some context on exactly what happened over week 4-6.   Table of Contents ToggleElectrocardiogram (EKG) ResultsThyroid Levels UpdateCholesterol Levels UpdateAssessing Inflammation In The ArteriesPlan Of Attack To Lower LDL Cholesterol Levels And Potentially Lower InflammationReiterating My Personal Goals For My DietMisconceptions About The Vertical DietThe Vertical Diet DownloadRelated Electrocardiogram (EKG) Results  My EKG results look good which is obviously a good sign. The next step will be getting an Echocardiogram and a Calcium Score to test for plaque build up in my arteries. Thyroid Levels Update Body temperature is about the same on average, not much notable change there, however, there are some evenings where my temperature has reached the mid 97’s which is the highest I’ve seen it in quite some time. Energy levels are about the same, and nothing noticeable has changed. To get into the Thyroid sluggishness, I believe this is mostly attributed to a lengthy recovery still taking place after over a year of T4 + T3 abuse. At least, that’s my guess. My TSH at baseline before starting the diet was 1.37 mU/L, which isn’t bad.  That indicates that my Thyroid isn’t producing a large amount of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone because there is a sufficient enough amount of T4 and T3 in my body already. However, at week 5 my TSH was at 3.02 mU/L.  This means that between my baseline blood work, and my 5 week in blood work, my Thyroid started downregulating, with a diminishing amount of T4 and T3, which is causing my Thyroid Stimulating Hormone to spike up to signal it to produce more T4 (and in turn, T3). So basically in layman’s terms, my Thyroid is getting worse, so my TSH is spiking up to try and compensate. My T3 levels at week 5 were also at the very low end of “normal”, and in some areas of the world would actually be considered deficient.  We all know how much of a difference there is between the bottom end of “normal” for Testosterone and the high end, and the same applies for Thyroid. I want to get my T3 levels up to 5.0+ mU/L minimum, but I don't know if that's a realistic goal anymore. I will have updated blood work done again in a couple weeks to see where things are at (it’s already been a couple weeks since my week 5 blood test). Cholesterol Levels Update This is the number 1 thing I wanted to be aware of going into this diet, as I have always had a diet pretty low in cholesterol, saturated fat, and completely void of sugar. I was already aware that the combination of sugar with high cholesterol levels is what eventually leads to arterial inflammation, and in turn, calcification and plaque build up, but I wanted to give the diet the benefit of the doubt and check my blood work to make sure prior to making any preemptive assumptions. This is why I had baseline blood work done to check my cholesterol levels before starting the diet. There is so much misinformation out there whether or not red meat is dangerous or not, whether or not eggs will raise cholesterol or impact your cardiovascular health in a negative way, among a myriad of other highly debated topics. Unfortunately, the blood work I had tested in week 5 has revealed something pretty concerning to me regarding the diet. Prior to starting the diet, my Cholesterol was 3.36 mmol/L and my LDL Cholesterol was 2.46 mmol/L.  After only 5 weeks of eating this diet, my Cholesterol jumped up to 4.77 mmol/L and my LDL Cholesterol jumped to 3.74 mmol/L.  The cholesterol levels are evidently being spiked by the influx of cholesterol, saturated fat, and likely sugar in the diet. This is a multi-factor contribution effect, as there is no 1 food to blame here, they are all working in unison to spike my LDL. Here is what I believe is happening. I am on TRT, and we already know that Testosterone is notorious for wrecking lipid profiles. I actually know several guys who have horrible cholesterol levels even with cholesterol and saturated fat free diets, solely because of their TRT. The most common thing you’ll see in the blood work of Testosterone users is low HDL levels (healthy cholesterol). And you will also commonly see high LDL levels, however, bringing up low HDL seems to be the bigger challenge of the two on TRT. That’s actually one of the things I was hoping this diet would fix for me, my chronically low HDL levels. Despite my consistent exercise, clean diet and supplementation specifically addressing improving cholesterol levels, nothing has worked to push my HDL into the healthy range, although my LDL has always been where it should be. Prior to the Vertical Diet at baseline, my HDL was 0.63 mmol/L, and 5 weeks into the vertical diet my HDL increased to 0.79 mmol/L. So, a notable increase, but far too negligible to justify continuing my specific meal plan when it comes along with a near doubling of my LDL. We already know that cholesterol and saturated fat have been overblown in the past in regards to their dangers, but here is the truth. Inherently, on their own dietary cholesterol and saturated fat are not unhealthy, in fact they play a very vital role in optimal health. However, in conjunction with sugar and other inflammatory catalysts, THAT is when cholesterol and saturated fat become unhealthy. Here’s what I learned and you need to understand when it comes to these two things. If you had a diet that caused literally 0 inflammation (like the carnivore diet for example), then the cholesterol and saturated fat you eat would perform their functions in the body as intended. It’s only once you start eating processed junk, sugar, etc. that you cause major micro biome disturbances, and can cause inflammation in the arteries. This inflammation then creates a scenario where fatty deposits/plaque build up and become dangerous by inhibiting blood flow in the arteries. Also, there is a threshold where increasing your intake of dietary cholesterol wouldn’t spike the cholesterol levels in your blood, it’s typically only when your diet is completely absent of any dietary cholesterol (like mine) where adding it in up to that threshold would cause a large spike in the blood serum levels, which is exactly what happened to me. For some individuals, adding more cholesterol or saturated fat to their diet may result in zero increase in their blood serum levels. Assessing Inflammation In The Arteries So, the culprit is the inflammation, and the cholesterol and saturated fat are not to blame, they are simply a piece of the equation that can cause issues in the presence of chronic inflammation. I was already aware of this, but I wanted to see for myself if adding in a bunch of dietary cholesterol, saturated fat, and sugar into my diet would actually reflect a negative outcome in my blood work. The unfortunate reality is that a diet that is optimized for gut health and maximum muscular recovery and strength gain is not what the optimal diet would be for cardiovascular disease prevention. There needs to be a happy medium of sorts. TRT as I mentioned is probably one of the main factors for my cholesterol levels spiking so dramatically, and then add on top of that the dextrose and fructose post-workout, and multiple doses of fructose throughout the day to stroke my metabolism, and I have a perfect storm of inflammation in my body where fatty deposits in the arteries can then start to become a problem, and down the line would likely result in major blockages that would send me to the hospital with a stroke or heart attack. Plan Of Attack To Lower LDL Cholesterol Levels And Potentially Lower Inflammation My best guess is the key to making this diet heart friendly for my personal lifestyle (factoring in that I’m on TRT and my genetics) is eliminating the eggs, sugar, and red meat. I'll be doing this in a one by one elimination fashion though so I know exactly how much each is/isn't responsible for. The sugar plays a role in the diet that can't be replaced (metabolic stimulation and muscular recovery) so that will be the last thing to go, even though it's pretty obvious that the combination of sugar with the cholesterol and saturated fat is the culprit here (best guess anyways), as opposed to the cholesterol and saturated fat alone. Eggs, I can get biotin, choline and Vitamin K2 separately (which I do already), and red meat I can get the B vitamins and iron separately if needed. I’m already covered for the B Vitamins in my supplements I take daily, but I may need to add an iron supplement if I end up dropping the red meat. But the sugar, plays a major in post-workout recovery, stimulating the metabolism throughout the day, providing a mega-dense iodine source through the cranberry juice, the first 2 being things I can't really replace with any alternatives aside from other carb sources with formidable gastric emptying times, so it'll be the last thing to go. I can’t drop my TRT either, even though it is a HUGE part of the equation here. I was able to control my LDL easily on TRT prior to this diet though, so I’m confident I will be able to get my levels back in the healthy range via dietary alterations only, the HDL will still need to be addressed though too, but the super high LDL is the thing that needs to come down immediately. Basically, the order of elimination will be based on what I can replace the easiest without creating a deficiency. And at the top of the list is Eggs. Since this blood work, I dropped the 4 eggs and replaced it with Psyllium Husk and a cup of oatmeal. I’m hoping that adding in a good daily dose of soluble fiber will help bring the cholesterol down, and obviously the 4 eggs being gone will help a lot as well. How much will it help though, that will be determined by my follow-up blood work that I plan on getting done in the next couple weeks. It’s already been a couple weeks since my week 5 blood work, so whatever build up the eggs had caused should be gone by the time I go in, and it will then give me an extremely accurate way of assessing exactly how much of a role 4 eggs daily had on my LDL levels, in unison with the red meat, sugar and Testosterone. If my LDL is still too high, the next food to be eliminated will be the red meat. I’m currently eating 1 pound of 90/10 grass-fed ground bison per day right now, and have been for 2 months now to date. This slow elimination method will provide great insight into exactly how much these foods impact my levels, and how detrimental they could be to my health. Now, I could always just go to a zero inflammation diet and not have to worry about these things, but that is not what aligns with my personal goals. Reiterating My Personal Goals For My Diet Most people who haven’t been following my logs, or me in general, would probably question why someone would be so insane as to keep sugar and red meat in their diet even after seeing their cholesterol levels get destroyed. If this is your first time reading one of my logs, this is what you need to understand about my personal goals. The goal for me is not solely about finding the diet that will result in the longest life span. If that were the case then I absolutely would not be trying to crank my IGF-1 up, using high-normal doses of TRT, or anything that could be tied to increased cardiovascular risk or expediting cancer cell growth. My goal is finding the best happy medium between the maximization of my body composition, hitting all macro AND micronutrient needs, while still maintaining as high a quality of life/minimal risk of cardiovascular health and cancer as possible. These are all conflicting things, and there is no perfect diet solution. And there is a ton of misinformation out there, so what do you do when you don't know who to believe, you get baseline bloods done and you do a ton of experiments on yourself to see exactly what your own individual genetics dictate is the best diet for your personal goals. That is what this log is about, it is not about what's the best diet for every one, or what's the healthiest diet, it's about me and my goals, and logging my own experience for others to use as an unbiased reference point that are in a similar situation. If a diet style was blatantly going to have a cumulatively negative effect on my health, I would alter it immediately, which is why I’m focusing on getting my LDL down while I keep my TRT in place and still have all this sugar in the diet. How do I know what causes what though and what is actually dangerous when it comes to my own genetic response coupled with all other factors in my lifestyle that could vastly differ from another guy's? It's by trialing it, getting bloods, and then eliminating it and replacing it with something I think will work better if need be. I anticipate that red meat and the sugar will eventually be eliminated entirely, but I want to have blood work to reference along the way to ensure I know EXACTLY how much each is impacting me personally relative to all of my other lifestyle factors present. Misconceptions About The Vertical Diet Every uneducated and ignorant person who thinks they understand nutrition takes a glance at the Vertical Diet and scoffs, thinking that it’s full of nutrient deficiencies, and that Stan only feeds athletes red meat and rice. That is SO far from the truth. I actually probably eat more vegetables in the Vertical Diet than most guys who follow their own version of a “clean diet”. I definitely eat more vegetables than I used to that’s for sure. I also hit every single micronutrient need you could think of, many of which were totally unaddressed prior to me doing this diet, and I believe it’s largely why I felt that boost in energy and sense of well-being despite my Thyroid still being sluggish. The horizontal axis (the micronutrient portion) of the diet is so comprehensive, and only individuals who haven’t actually bought the diet and read it would say that the diet is lacking, because it absolutely is not. Do I think that the sugar, cholesterol and saturated fat could contribute to heart disease in some individuals? Yes, but does that mean the diet itself isn’t covering all of your bases? No, in fact, my blood pressure and resting heart rate are better than they were prior to the diet, and that’s largely due to the balance of Sodium : Potassium : Water : Magnesium that Stan has set up in the diet, as well as it just being healthy in general. Once I finally eliminate everything that is spiking inflammatory markers, and get my cholesterol to a healthy level, I will still be continuing adhering to 90% of the Vertical Diet. The horizontal axis component of it is totally overlooked by haters and I strongly encourage you actually read through it before you write it off completely. If all I cared about was muscle recovery, gaining size and strength, I’d keep everything exactly the same. Even if I was natural and wasn’t using Testosterone, or had better genetics, I may even have been able to leave the eggs, red meat and sugar all in there and had no issues. Keep in mind, this diet is getting tweaked relative to my own personal goals AND genetics, and not because the diet is inherently unhealthy. Get your blood work done, and weigh out all your options relative to your own goals when you embark on a major dietary change like this is my number one suggestion.

    "content": "How To Know If You’re Prone To Hair Loss And Monitor Your Progress     Typically, hair loss is noticed is by accident. Maybe you take a picture of yourself in bad lighting and you notice you can see your scalp now, or you’re combing your hair and it seems like there’s a lot more falling out into your sink than before, or you notice there is a bunch of hair laying on your pillow when you wake up in the morning. Regardless of how it happens, eventually you’re going to start noticing your hair loss, and the unfortunate reality is that unless you are proactively monitoring it, you will more than likely already have lost 25% of your hair (or significantly more) by the time you can actually see a visible difference in the mirror. You have 100,000 hair follicles. That’s what you have to work with, and once your body hits puberty and your system is flooded with high concentrations of androgens, your hair follicles start miniaturizing relative to your genetic affinity to miniaturization from DHT, and Testosterone to a lesser extent (it’s less androgenic than DHT and doesn’t have nearly as much of an affinity to binding). What most guys do is they don’t even look into hair loss prevention until they’ve visually noticed loss, and at that point they’re playing catch up. DO NOT make this mistake.  Prevention is FAR easier than reversal, so if you can prevent yourself from getting to that point in the first place, you will greatly increase your odds of maintaining a strong head of hair. So, how do you gauge if you’re losing hair and strictly monitor if your hair loss prevention regimen is working vs not working? You need an accurate way of measuring hair loss, and that way is with a hair catcher. This is the one I’ve been using for almost a decade now:  The reason why you need to get a hair catcher is that it is the only way you can accurately monitor if changes in your regimen are making a difference, and in general if your hair loss is improving or getting worse. The first thing you want to do after you get a hair catcher is get a firm baseline reading. Before you even start your hair loss prevention regimen, count how many hairs are in your hair catcher on average per shower. Ensure that if you don’t shower the same number of times per week, that you account for whatever inconsistently spaced out days you have. E.G. if you wash your hair once every two days, but then will occasionally wash your hair once every 3 days, you need to keep track and ensure you remember that. You naturally lose 100 hairs each day due to the life cycle of the hair follicles on your head, totally unrelated to androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness/permanent hair loss), so you will naturally have more hair in your hair catcher if you have showers less frequently. I would advise that you start a consistent schedule so you can measure more accurately, as sporadically showering every day, followed by once every three days, or any kind of inconsistent schedule will make it impossible to create an accurate average baseline for you to use as your reference moving forward. Monitor your hair catcher hair counts closely for a week or two, and get a consistent average so you know with a high level of accuracy how many hairs you lose in the shower with no protection. Afterwards, you can then start implementing a hair loss prevention protocol, and tell EXACTLY how much it is helping your progress as you will have a baseline reference to compare to. E.G. if you have a baseline of 100 hairs lost per shower (pretty high – depending on how often you shower), and then you added a Ketoconazole shampoo into your regimen and your average hair loss count dropped to 50 hairs per shower, it’s safe to say that the Ketoconazole shampoo is solely responsible for improving your hair loss by 50% Then, after you have established a firm average for that particular treatment over the course of several weeks of measurement, you can then choose to add in another variable and repeat the process. Let’s say the next step is you add in Finasteride to systemically lower your DHT. You would then start taking measurement averages of your hair loss counts in the hair catcher while on both Finasteride and the Ketoconazole shampoo. And let’s say your hair loss drops down to 10 hair lost per shower on average. You can then conclude that Finasteride coupled with Ketoconazole shampoo has essentially completely halted your hair loss, or at least pretty close to it. Remember, it’s still natural to lose 100 hairs per day just due to the natural life cycle of your hair follicles. Anything above and beyond that is a cause for concern though. That DOES NOT mean 100 hairs in your hair catcher. You will lose hair in your sleep, walking around, combing your hair, etc. So do not make a mistake and think if you’re losing 100 hairs in your shower that you are just losing natural hair that is supposed to fall out. It’s very unlikely that all the hair you’ve lost naturally throughout the day is just sitting perfectly on your hair and hasn’t fallen out at some other point during the day. The best regrowth I’ve experienced was when I got my hair loss down to about 1-5 hairs lost per shower. Once you get your hormones handled and really line everything up (depending how extreme you’re willing to go with this stuff), you will actually have a hard time losing hair even if you try. At the peak of my hair loss, I’d run my hands through my hair and pull out 10-20 hairs at a time with ease. At the peak of my hair loss prevention, I only lose hair if I forcefully comb it or forcefully run my fingers through it. The reason this is far more accurate is because:  You won’t know if you’re progressing or regressing unless you have a baseline and constantly monitor shedding counts You can fairly accurately predict if your hair will improve in the future or get far worse based on your current averages of loss in the hair catcher  If you’re losing hundreds of hairs per shower, it’s safe to say you’re losing hair at a faster rate than you are growing it, therefore if you continued and left it at that rate, you would eventually start either diffuse thinning and/or progressing hairline recession. If you’re losing only a couple hairs per shower, it’s safe to say you’re losing hair at a slower rate than you are growing it, therefore if you continued and left it at that rate, you would eventually start improving your hair density and/or possibly regrow hair in areas that had receded but hadn’t permanently closed off/calcified yet    A hair catcher is cheap, and it only takes an extra 60 seconds of your day to pick it up after each shower and do a quick tally of how much hair is in it. Regardless of how prone to hair loss you think you are or aren’t, you will not be able to make a definitive assessment if you’re preventing hair loss or not without an accurate means of measurement. I highly recommend you get a hair catcher right away; it’s the first step in our fight against hair loss.

He's already self admittedly had 2 (or it might be 3 now?) heart attacks because of drug usage. The most notable cocktail of drugs being the combination of high doses of Viagra with Cocaine, which can send even the healthiest hearts into the danger zone.  Dan's always mentioned how he uses TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy), HGH (Human Growth Hormone), Stem Cells, among many other drugs and cutting edge treatments to improve his quality of life and improve his physique. He has never outlined his exact steroid protocol though to the public (as far as I know), until a recent Instagram Story where he posted it for the world to see:  Dan Bilzerian's Steroid & PED Regimen  100 mg of Testosterone every 5 days (works out to 140 mg of Testosterone per week/7 days) 1 iu of HGH Cialis  Dan's got a pretty solid physique.

Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) The reference range for Testosterone (the “healthy” amount for a man to have circulating in his blood stream) is extremely general, and ranges from 270ng/dL all the way up to 1070 ng/dL. This means for the average idiotic doctor who knows nothing about male hormones (but will readily prescribe Estrogen to females like candy), they will tell a 21 year old male they are healthy if their total Testosterone is at 270 ng/dL. I don't think I need to tell you that there is a huge difference between 270 ng/dL and 1000+, but if I do, then let's just put it this way. It could be the difference between you walking around functioning with a high quality of life, and you walking around with a dysfunctional penis, a non-existent sex drive, and extreme difficulty putting on muscle and burning fat. The true purpose of TRT is to use exogenous Testosterone to achieve a Testosterone level that is in the middle of that range, or ideally on the high end of that range. The high end being commonly referred to as “high-normal”, as it's the high end of what a normal functioning male in their prime would endogenously produce themselves if they had top tier genetics. How many genetic phenoms are there out there naturally pumping out 1000 ng/dL test levels courtesy of their balls and not relying on exogenous T to hit that blood serum concentration? Not many. After you hit 30 years old, your Testosterone levels will start to naturally decline by 1% per year. Each year you will inevitably lose more of your natural hormone production, until eventually you are on the low end of the reference range, or have fallen out of it entirely, which would THEN at that point qualify you for TRT as far as most ignorant doctors are concerned. Bodybuilder TRT Vs Actual TRT Bilzerian pins 100 mg of Testosterone every 5 days, which works out to 140 mg of Testosterone per week. Now, while this may be an amount prescribed fairly often (especially in the US), it is almost undoubtedly not representative of what true TRT is. Dan is on what I like to call “Bodybuilder TRT”.  Basically, if you fall into the reference range, your hormonal profile will only support recovery and muscle growth up until the capacity of what that amount of hormones can achieve. Anything beyond that ~1100 ng/dL Testosterone level, is now in the supraphyisological range, and is essentially like being on a mini-cycle year round. According to Dr. Oz, healthy men naturally produce between 4-7 mg of Testosterone per day. Almost nobody is actually getting their blood tested on a regular basis like they should, so putting a natural baseline in perspective with milligrams is a much easier way to illustrate what a 100+ mg weekly dosage of Testosterone will yield when it comes to total blood serum concentrations. To put it in perspective, you would be extremely hard-pressed to find an individual who is naturally producing the equivalent of what 100 mg of Testosterone would yield in the blood every week, let alone every 5 days. This is one of the biggest cop outs in the fitness industry right now, where bodybuilders will create and maintain absurdly supraphysiological physiques, but then claim natural, or claim they aren't getting any additional help from the drugs they are using because it is just “a replacement dose”. No natural human is producing 200+ mg of Testosterone per week, 2+ iu's of GH, let alone any significant amounts of Nandrolone or any of the other anabolics these anti-aging clinics are prescribing patients in the US nowadays.  If I had to make an educated guess, I would probably guess that Bilzerian's total Testosterone levels are upwards of 1200-1500+ ng/dL if he's using pharma grade Testosterone (or accurately dosed UGL Testosterone). Now, he's not on a crazy dose by any means, and my guess is that he probably chooses to not push it far beyond that on purpose due to his history of heart attacks, and the fact that he's almost 40 years old now. With that being said, you don't need much to achieve an amazing physique, and he's proof of that.

These same slightly supraphysiological Testosterone levels can achieve and maintain a very elite physique that someone ignorant to how well anabolic steroids actually work would commonly assume is unachievable with “TRT” dosages. Granted, while the amount Bilzerian uses is almost undoutedbly not true TRT, his body may not process exogenous hormones well and it could very well be how much he needs just to achieve high-normal levels. However, the scenario with the far greater likelihood is that the amount he uses puts him slightly into supraphysiological territory, essentially a very mild year round steroid cycle. This doesn't discredit the work he puts in or the strict dieting he adheres to, let's make that clear as well. These hormones simply put your body in a more conducive environment for recovery and muscle growth IN THE PRESENCE OF sufficient nutrients, resistance training, and rest.

Seriously, I've done cycles in the past where I just loaded myself to the gills but half-assed my lifting, cardio, and diet and my results were far worse than what I've achieved with what would be considered baby dosages with a perfect diet and training regimen. The standard “newbie” cycle of 500 mg of Testosterone per week is so f*cking overkill for a beginner it's not even funny, and the misguided information young guys are getting on anabolics is just brutal nowadays. While I don't advise combining Cocaine and other rec drugs into the equation obviously (and I'm sure he'd advise against it as well), Bilzerian's mild steroid usage for someone wanting to achieve an elite physique is a great example of what mild/more responsible steroid dosages can achieve.

It is not anabolic, and it does not induce any hypertrophy whatsoever. What it does do though is Lipolysis (burns fat) as well as inhibits Hepatic De Novo Lipogenesis (inhibits fat accumulation). It also has notable anti-aging benefits like improved complexion, skin quality, hair growth, etc. Aside from the Lipolytic properties of GH, it is most commonly used by bodybuilders for the IGF-1 it converts to in the liver. IGF-1 supports cellular division, making it the only hormone that can actually create brand new muscle cells via muscular cell division. The cellular division aspect of IGF-1 is what makes it so attractive to bodybuilders and athletes, because when you hear of “genetic potential” it refers to how much hypertrophy you can cause in your current muscle cells. You can only max these out so much, even with the addition of anabolic steroids or insulin. After you have done this, literally the only thing that will let you break through that plateau is HGH and IGF-1, as (in layman’s terms) you will be able to create new muscle cells, and then you have those new cells that you can cause hypertrophy in and max out. As a result, you have a seemingly unlimited amount of muscle growth potential the higher you drive your IGF-1 levels up. The dosage Dan stated he uses though (1 iu per day) is so low that one would not be able to drive up IGF-1 levels enough to induce any notable amounts of Hyperplasia of muscle cells. We can conclude that the dosage Dan uses is largely used anti-aging, and more likely than not the slight edge it will give in staying lean. It is not a miracle drug, despite how much it's hyped up online, and 1 iu per day is a legitimate hormone replacement dose. Cialis Cialis (Tadalafil) is not anabolic but I decided to write briefly about it as it's the only other notable performance enhancing drug (if you can call it that) he's stated he uses regularly. Cialis is a prescription drug that is typically prescribed for those with erectile dysfunction. It inhibits phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5 inhibitor) and acts as a potent vasodilator, allowing far greater ease in achieving and sustaining an erection. Basically, it improves circulation and blood flow to your penis. Out of all the ED drugs, it is by far my favorite as it has a very long half-life, and its' efficacy is not inhibited by taking it on a full stomach vs an empty stomach. Viagra has a much shorter half life and works far worse if you aren't on a totally empty stomach. So why would you take Cialis preworkout if it's an erectile dysfunction medication? Like I mentioned, it's a potent vasodilator, meaning it helps get a better pump in the gym too. Not to mention it also can lower blood pressure, which is likely a welcomed side benefit for Bilzerian. I know plenty of bodybuilders who take a small dose of Cialis every day simply for the blood pressure lowering effect. Bascially, Cialis = better pumps in the gym, way better erections, and lowered blood pressure. The worst side effect I've experienced from Cialis to date is an annoying stuffed nose (common side effect). Will Cialis provide any additional muscle gain in the gym? Likely no, at least directly, however, improved circulation means better recovery to an extent of the muscle, likely better nutrient partitioning, and the increase in pump will not only help with the mind muscle connection, but it will help stretch the fascia out. Fascial stretching is ultimately what induces hypertrophy, and the more you can stretch that fascia the better. How much of a difference do I think it really makes at the end of the day on overall fascial stretching and long-term hypertrophy potential? Not much, but if you workout harder because you're getting a better pump then by all means. I've definitely done it before.

Site Enhancement Oil (SEO) is rampant in bodybuilding. Anytime a top pro brings up a severely lagging body part that has been an issue for years, SEO is almost always the thing responsible, and not a sudden change in training technique. Granted, with that being said, it still isn’t a miracle worker. There are countless top IFBB pro bodybuilders notorious for lagging body parts, and I’d be shocked if they hadn’t tried everything in the book to try and bring them up. E.G. Ben Pakulski, who has many times claimed he has the most cutting edge and knowledgeable training techniques, and would hook himself up to all kinds of cutting edge machines to test muscle firing and execute “next level” techniques (which I’m sure also included site enhancement injections), and yet his arms still severely lagged behind the rest of his body for his entire career.  Now, to preface this article, let’s clarify what is generally regarded as “SEO” to bodybuilders. The acronym stands for Site Enhancement Oil as I mentioned, however, the term “SEO” has started to be used in a far more general context, and nowadays commonly is also used to describe products that aren’t oil based at all. One example being Hyaluronic Acid based “SEO”. For the sake of simplicity, I will be referring to all site enhancement products in this article as SEO, as that category is just widely referred to now as encompassing all products that are injected into a specific area to achieve a localized growth effect. BUT, be aware that it is NOT accurate whatsoever to refer to anything non-oil based as an SEO. This is just how the acronym has evolved as it made its way through underground bodybuilding circles over the years. What Does SEO Do And What Is The Mechanism Of Action Behind It’s Effect On Muscle Growth? There is a huge misconception that Synthol creates these weird looking freaks you see on the internet:  Most of these guys are just slamming themselves full of Liters (not millilitres) of random oil, not necessarily Synthol. All Synthol really is is sterilized oil with no hormone in it. E.G. the oil that could suspend the Steroids you may already inject, without the Steroids in them. The idea behind it is that if you inject enough of it, you will eventually need more room in the muscle to accommodate all of that oil, as there is only a finite space of muscle to accommodate it. Once you reach that tipping point where the muscle needs more room to accommodate the amount of oil being pushed into it, the fascia of the muscle would forcefully stretch to accommodate the contents being pushed into it. Once the body has metabolized that oil, you are left with newly stretched space that can be filled in with real muscle tissue. A lot of bodybuilders use it, but it is used in sane quantities (or at least less insane), so it goes without notice most of the time, although there are still times where shots go wrong and it becomes quite obvious on stage that something is up. What Exactly Is Synthol Made Of? Traditional “Synthol” is comprised of 85% oil, 7.5% of Lidocaine (numbing agent/painkiller) and 7.5% alcohol (to sterilize the solution).  All 3 of which are commonly included in medical grade injections for various drugs. The most relatable in this context being anabolic steroids. The oil your steroids are suspended in is just sterile oil with some alcohol added to sterilize the solution. That means that without the hormone in it (whatever steroid you are injecting whether that be Testosterone, Nandrolone, etc.), you are technically injecting Synthol. Even when you inject your weekly TRT shot you’re technically injecting small amounts of Synthol. Every one has this huge misconception that Synthol is some sort of foreign compound that blows up a muscle, but the reality is that it’s just the same sterile oil everything you already inject is suspended in, it’s just used in exorbitant beyond extreme quantities when it comes to forcefully inducing fascial stretching in a localized muscle group. Botched Synthol Injections Most of the time, the more disastrous cases of blown up looking body parts are caused by steroid shot infections where the guy just should’ve stayed home.  As mentioned previously as well, there are the guys you see all over the internet with horrible looking ballooned muscles, who are typically just guys with no foundation of muscle tissue to begin with who just shot obscene amounts (literally tens of thousands of millilitres) of oil into themselves and ruined their physiques.  Responsible use of Synthol (sterile oil used to manually stretch the fascia) is often completely unnoticed, especially when used in an intelligent way in a muscle group that is already well developed, but may just genetically lag behind the rest of the body. That is the true intention of Synthol, not to shove thousands of millilitres into a foundation-less physique, but rather to help bring up a lagging body part in an already well developed physique with muscle bellies that can accommodate that extra fascial stretching without looking distorted or unnatural. Hyaluronic Acid Vs Synthol For Site Enhancement Oil based Synthol use has been around for decades. However, only in more recent years has Hyaluronic Acid been utilized for the purposes of fascial stretching. Purported as a new science in many bodybuilding circles, most are completely oblivious to the fact that this “new science” is simply based upon new-age dermal fillers that are used for getting rid of visible wrinkles, face lifts, and even the volumization of certain muscle groups. For example, women commonly get Hyaluronic Acid shots in their butts for augmentation and shaping.   Which Is Better And Why? The reason why it is garnering so much attention is largely because it can replicate the same level of fascial stretching as traditional Synthol usage without the need to administer copious amounts of product. There are also some marketing claims made by underground sellers of the product that are less notable, but I will get into those later. Basically the main draw of it is it can suck up multiple times its’ weight in water, hence it can be used in much lower volumes with far fewer injections, and achieve a comparable, or even superior level of fascial stretching, with a greater margin of error as there are several clinical studies to back up its use as a well tolerated volumizing agent. Fewer injections also is just far more convenient and results in a lower chance of nicking something, jabbing through something you shouldn’t have, or otherwise causing some major health complication which would be far more likely with hundreds of milliliters of foreign sterile oil being shoved into your muscle on a daily basis. A standard Synthol loading protocol would typically have a user injecting 5-10x as much total volume as a Hyaluronic Acid based loading protocol. Determining which is better would ultimately be up to personal preference and one’s own individual response to a particular product, but I’d say just from a clinical data and efficiency standpoint, it’s safe to say that highly cross-linked and concentrated (mg/ml) cosmetic grade Hyaluronic Acid like Juvederm (or a formidable generic) is going to be the candidate of choice for intramuscular fascial stretching. History Of Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Fillers While Botox and other brands used for cosmetic enhancements are the most well known to the general public, more recent developments using Hyaluronic Acid based dermal fillers have started to take the limelight in cosmetic procedures. The reason being that Hyaluronic Acid based fillers are well tolerated by the body, and the skin already has Hyaluronic Acid present in it, it simply diminishes with age, and is partly what is responsible for the aging process of the skin. So not only is it a bioidentical substance already present in the body, but it is able to suck up multiple times its’ weight in water and plump up and/or smooth out specific areas of the face. It is most commonly used to fill wrinkles, and plump up/enlarge lips. It rarely causes allergic reactions, is generally well tolerated, and it lasts for a long time, making it an ideal candidate for several different applications in plastic surgery. How Are Hyaluronic Acid Fillers Created In order to make Hyaluronic Acid more durable, Hyaluronic Acid molecules are linked to one another. More cross-linking makes the Hyaluronic Acid molecules firmer in consistency, more water absorbent, and longer lasting. How Do You Know How Potent A Hyaluronic Acid Based Site Enhancement Product Is? An experienced clinician will choose the Hyaluronic Acid with right amount of cross-linking to meet your specific needs, based on the area(s) requiring treatment. If the cross linking is very minimal it makes it a thin liquid, which is typically ideally suited for under-eye or tear trough fillers, whereas if the cross linking is much higher, it makes it a very thick gel, which is typically suited for bony areas of the face to enhance bony prominences like cheek bones, or site specific muscles in the body (like the buttocks) where it is administered intramuscularly to achieve maximum volumization/enlargement as it plumps up the most (absorbs the most water). The more cross-linked and concentrated (mg/ml) the HA is, the thicker it will be, and the more water it will suck up/plump up whatever it is sitting in (skin, muscle, etc.). The more water it can suck up and the longer it can stay put without degradation, the more volumization/fascial stretching potential there would be.  This is an example of a highly cross-linked/concentrated cosmetic grade Hyaluronic Acid dermal filler.  Pay close attention to the viscosity of the syringe contents in particular, as well as the fact that it's preloaded due to how dense it is (fast forward to 1:30).  Cosmetic Grade Hyaluronic Acid Fillers Vs Underground Private Labeled Hyaluronic Acid Fillers For these underground products to be cost effective, they are typically sold in concentrations that are quite weak. As mentioned, the thinner and less concentrated a Hyaluronic Acid filler is, the quicker it will degrade, and the less water it will suck up. One preloaded syringe of Juvederm can cost upwards of $500-1000  Granted, these are cosmetic grade prices, meaning the FDA has looked at them and approved them for plastic surgery/cosmetic procedures, and with this approval comes a giant markup from the manufacturer. However, these are still the top of the line products in terms of potency, and while there are places to get generic brand-less dermal fillers formidable in concentration and cross-linking, it is not easy to come by, and the government will make sure of that. It would make zero sense to put a brand-less filler on the market for $40-50 when they can ensure there is no competition in the market legally allowed to sell a cosmetic grade filler at that concentration, slap a FDA approved label on the approved brands, and sell each preloaded syringe via plastic surgeons for $500-1000+ It’s highly unlikely an underground seller will be able to profit on marking up preloaded syringes of top notch Hyaluronic Acid if they kept pricing semi-reasonable, because the cost of just one syringe of this stuff is so exorbitant. E.G. if you’re buying them and trying to private label them, and you’re getting them in from China at $20-30 each, you would probably need to charge a minimum of $50+ just to make some money on each unit after you factor in shipping, labeling, credit card processor merchant fees, website hosting, marketing, hiring employees to ship the product and package it, etc. Would any bodybuilder pay $50-100 for one shot of Hyaluronic Acid? Probably not. This is why these underground products are coming in multi-dose vials with lower than satisfactory levels of potency. If a Hyaluronic Acid product even resembles liquid in any capacity and can be sucked up through a multi-dose vial with thinner than a 20 gauge needle, I would be extremely skeptical, and then I would be looking at how many mg/ml the product actually contains. These products come preloaded in ready to shoot syringes for a reason for plastic surgery. They are so viscous and thick, that they need to be preloaded in a syringe and ready to go during manufacturing; they can’t be sucked up through a multi-dose vial for administration. If you want to see how potent your product is, just compare it side by side with Juvederm, or a formidable cosmetic grade brand at a concentration used in plastic surgery for volumization.  Also, whatever product you are using should explicitly state how many milligrams per millilitre the product contains. If you are buying an underground product that just says “high potency” or something along those lines, you need to question further.   How Long Does Synthol Last Vs Hyaluronic Acid There is a huge misconception about how long these SEO products will sit in the muscle for. Because Synthol is literally just sterile oil, the body metabolizes it fairly quickly. Within a few days actually, it’s only once you start getting into the extreme quantities, pinning it every single day (loading phase), that it obviously will take your body longer to metabolize it all and get rid of it. Think about how long it takes for your body to get rid of the oil in your glute that you shoot once or twice per week with Testosterone. You’re probably pinning the same spot again a week later right? That’s because your body can metabolize the sterile oil the steroid is suspended in that quickly where the spot is ready to go again a week later. Granted, once you start pinning multiple compounds in higher dosages, or shorter esters, that’s when injection site rotation becomes far more of a necessity, but just for simplicity purposes, I’m laying out the fact that sterile oil is readily absorbed and metabolized by the human body fairly quickly. Highly cross-linked and concentrated Hyaluronic Acid fillers on the other hands have been proven in clinical studies to last up to 2 years before they are fully broken down. When it comes to being permanent, Hyaluronic Acid based site enhancement products will sit in your muscle the longest, BY FAR (at least compared to Synthol).    Is that a bad thing though? No, the whole point of using a dermal filler like that is for long lasting results, and to reap the benefits of it without the body just degrading it within days. Meaning you can get away with FAR less injection frequency, and reap the volumization rewards of it for a FAR longer span of time. The issue is that some individuals marketing it on the underground market are completely oblivious to how this stuff works in the first place, and are throwing around misinformation stating that Synthol is permanent and that Hyaluronic Acid is in and out of the body quickly. It’s quite the opposite. The only way a Hyaluronic Acid filler would be broken down quickly by the body would be if it was less cross-linked and less concentrated. But, then you would be defeating the purpose of it in a bodybuilding context anyways, as these products would be used to achieve maximum fascial stretching, and not to provide a negligible plumping effect (if any at all) and be broken down in the body within days. To achieve the true maximum benefits of volumization/water absorption/fascial stretching in a localized muscle group, enough Hyaluronic Acid would need to be shot into it with as highly concentrated (mg/ml) and cross-linked of a viscous product as possible. In Conclusion There are tons of studies to support Hyaluronic Acid usage in cosmetic procedures. Instead of listening to random “bodybuilding gurus” or guys perceived as authorities in the industry due to their good genetics and drug response, I compel you to read through the research yourself. There is so much misinformation in this industry, the only way you can be certain you aren’t getting biased, or completely misinformed information is by diving into it yourself head first. So, who can you trust then? Honestly, you need to become skilled at sifting through BS, consulting with those who have an abundance of personal experience and are intelligent, personal experimentation, and just soaking up every single source of credible information you can until you can arrive at an educated conclusion on your own.

    "content": "Vertical Diet Log | Week 2 & 3 Update      Vertical Diet Log | Week 2 & 3 Update  I’m now 3 weeks into The Vertical Diet by Stan Efferding.  Body Temperature And Thyroid Function I’ve been carefully monitoring my body temperature every day, multiple times per day. I did experience a minor elevation during week 1, but since then I have seen no additional improvements. Granted, I am coming off of long-term exogenous T3 and T4 usage, which will undoubtedly skew things, and with the half life of T4 being so long, it’s quite likely that I’m still experiencing the rebound phase of Thyroid upregulation. At least that’s what I’m hoping, as I’m going to be pretty disappointed if this is all I’m capable of with maxed out natural function. I’m still waking up with borderline Hypothermic body temperatures every morning (95 °F), and the highest I have seen my body temperature go is 97.3 °F in the evening after eating all of my meals. Granted, that isn’t the worst body temperature to have at the end of the day, but I still definitely should not be waking up as cold as I am. Is this tied directly to my Thyroid? I can’t say for certain, but it’s quite likely in my opinion. Obviously the ideal would be to get my body temperature up to 98.6 °F, but for now I am just being patient and trusting the recovery process. Energy Levels Interestingly enough, despite having a disappointing 2 weeks in regards to my body temperature, one very notable benefit I’ve started to experience is a blatant improvement in my waking energy. Waking up is far easier than it usually is, and I’m actually consistently waking up before my alarm goes off now. Typically, I’d be KO’d until my alarm went off, and at that point I would often hit snooze about 5-10 times before I would be able to muster up the energy to roll my ass out of bed. I’m not a morning person whatsoever. However, this boost in the mornings has been such an obvious difference that I can’t help but be optimistic for my Thyroid situation. If I had Hypothyroidism that was getting worse, or not improving at all after coming off of T3 and T4, it’s quite unlikely that I would be experiencing an improvement in my levels of fatigue and energy like I am. Blood Work And Cardiovascular Risk Assessment I went to my doctor to get the necessary requisition forms to go get updated blood work, as well as an EKG done to assess cardiovascular risk factor improvement, or negative exacerbation. I'll be going to get an Echocardiogram done as well in the near future. The main things I want to assess are my thyroid function, heart function, lipids and hematology, as these are the markers that have likely been hit the hardest (if there have been any changes at all) over the past few weeks. The consistent consumption of red meat and whole eggs in particular has me somewhat concerned for my lipid profile and cardiovascular risk, but I will be able to see once and for all if these foods have negative implications on my health or not via the pattern of my blood work and literal analysis of my cardiovascular health/heart function over the course of the next few months. I will be having these same tests repeated multiple times to accurately track exactly what changes are happening in my body, whether that be for the better or for the worse. Appetite… This is a double-edged sword, as many individuals will welcome this. For me though, it’s definitely not a positive thing for strict caloric adherence. Some of these foods I need to eat in my horizontal axis are quite calorie dense (whole fat Greek yogurt, cheddar cheese, almonds, whole eggs, etc.) and that’s not even accounting for the calorie dense pound of red meat I use in my vertical axis. My caloric allotment is 3100 calories, and I can just manage to maintain single digit body fat % at this intake. However, I’m literally hungry ALL DAY. I’ve NEVER been this hungry on a diet only consisting of “clean food” (what would be normally be perceived as traditional nutritious diet choices) as I would typically choose more satiating, lower fat versions of the foods I'm eating. Despite my body weight being stable eating this much food, I can’t help but wonder how I will make this work when it comes time to cut down more aggressively. The horizontal axis in itself takes up a huge amount of calories, and I’m eating what would probably be considered a low amount of red meat compared to most others on this diet. I’m eating one pound of grass fed 85/15 ground bison each day for the record. I’ve already tried a few of the strategies outlined in the Vertical Diet for increasing satiety, but I’m still hungry almost all day. From what I have gathered up to now, the Vertical Diet is excellent for getting in an adequate amount of nutrients to recover and grow with ease and minimal digestive stress. However, despite it being geared towards a maximization of overall health, it could be difficult to stick to one’s calorie requirements once they get into a steep deficit. Of course, I could always just cut out certain foods for lower fat options, swap some stuff out and throw in some fiber dense food, and lower certain quantities of the foods in the horizontal axis after cutting down the rice, but then at that point I don’t even know if you could constitute what you are eating as the Vertical Diet. It would at that point just become a healthier version of your standard high satiety bodybuilder-cutting regimen. I don’t know, just thinking out loud here. I’m doing this diet for the health benefits more so than anything, so it can be difficult to justify cutting certain foods down/out entirely when you know they account entirely for your daily micronutrient requirements of one thing or another. There must be a happy medium that can be reached while dieting without sacrificing too much of the micronutrient fulfilment, and I’ll work on that in the coming months once I’ve sorted out this Thyroid situation. In Conclusion For now, I’m satisfied maintaining my current body composition on 3100 calories, and frankly, the fact that I can eat this much and not gain any weight shocked me a bit. Normally my bulk phases start at 3000 calories, and I can steadily gain weight from there. Regardless, interesting things are occurring, I’m optimistic about the changes I’m seeing, and I will be keeping a close eye on everything and continuing to log it for your reference.

    "content": "Vertical Diet Log | Week 1 Update     Vertical Diet Log | Week 1 Update I’m now officially 1 week into The Vertical Diet by Stan Efferding.  I’ve been closely monitoring everything, and following the diet to a tee. It’s a bit more cooking than I prefer (I prefer none because I’m a lazy cook), but it’s not too bad. If you’re going to be doing the Vertical Diet, I highly recommend getting a rice cooker. This thing has made it a million times easier to have rice with steamed spinach and red peppers mixed into it ready to go at a moments notice on a daily basis with minimal mess/clean up. Just to quickly list out the goals I want to accomplish with the Vertical Diet if you haven’t read my introduction/overview post, they are as follows:  Upregulate thyroid function as much as possible and get off of exogenous T4 and T3. Enhanced cognitive function Optimize gut health Hit all micronutrient needs Increase HDL cholesterol (while maintaining healthy LDL cholesterol) Optimize sodium, potassium and water balance Decrease resting heart rate and blood pressure  Body Temperature My body temperature is up an average of 0.5 °F upon waking, midday, and pre-bed. This is a good sign, especially considering I have all exogenous Thyroid hormones working their way out of my system right now. I was expecting to have more of a crash than I am, as it can take several weeks for natural Thyroid production to return to baseline, and even then, I’m not certain that my natural production is optimal to begin with. If my body temperature goes up while also coming off of T3/T4 cold turkey, that’s a fantastic sign and very promising for what I anticipated would be a long lag-time in recovery. Granted, we are only at the 1 week mark, and T4 has a half life of 7 days, meaning I still have plenty of exogenous hormones in my system. But, the T3 is probably more or less all gone, and at least half of the T4 is gone, and I’m not crashing into a state of Hypothyroid yet, so I’m optimistic that the Iodine/diet in general is facilitating a more efficient recovery. I check my temperature at least 3-4 times per day, so I will have a more conclusive update on this in the next couple weeks once all exogenous Thyroid hormone has completely exited my bloodstream. Digestion I dropped my Psyllium Husk fiber supplement from my diet this week. I was a bit anxious about doing that, as it seemed to really help, but I’m going to be trying this diet to a tee, and I didn’t want to have any additional fiber sources skewing the results I will be interpreting once my body has adapted to this diet. I had one day where my digestion went to hell, but that was more likely than not my own fault from overdoing the salt. Other than that, it’s been decent. Perhaps slightly improved, but it’s still too early to say for certain. I had a couple spotless days (no pun intended), and a couple days that were pretty normal (what you would expect from a standard “clean” diet. I will need to give this more time before I make a full assessment. Body Weight (Fat Loss?) I somehow managed to lose 2 pounds despite keeping my caloric intake exactly the same. The only thing that changed in my diet was the foods I was eating. The macronutrients and daily caloric intake are exactly the same as they were prior to the Vertical Diet, where I had been consistently maintaining my weight for weeks. The fact that I suddenly dropped 2 pounds after starting this is a great sign. It could just be a coincidence, but if this weight loss continues through week 2, then I will be forced to increase my daily caloric allotment to accommodate this increase in energy expenditure I’m suddenly experiencing. I’ll have a better indication whether this was a coincidence or not in the next 7 days, as I’m pretty religious about monitoring my weight and overall body composition and can notice very minute changes very quickly. Mental Clarity This is unchanged so far. Frankly, I don’t expect a significant boost in this until my Thyroid issue is worked out and I’m back to full tilt natural function. Being hypothyroid can cause severe brain fog, so I won’t make a judgment on this yet until my body is completely free of all exogenous T4. Resting Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Resting heart rate is down about 4 beats per minute on average, although I attribute this mainly to dropping the T3/T4 cold turkey. I’ll have a better idea how low I can get these in the coming weeks as well. In Conclusion It’s too early to make any kind of definitive assessment of what’s going on in my body, but so far the changes I’ve seen have made me optimistic for the weeks to come. I’m going to go get my requisition forms for another set of blood work so I can get some updates on where my Thyroid levels are in a few weeks, as that is my primary concern right now. I’m nearing the point where nearly all of the exogenous hormones have worked their way out of my blood and I may experience a fairly substantial Thyroid crash in the coming few days. Hopefully not, but we will see what happens.

The biggest mistake I see when it comes to hair loss prevention is when individuals incorrectly categorize themselves as “genetically prone” or “not genetically prone” to hair loss in general. Here’s the thing when it comes to hair loss, every single person with androgenic hormones in their body is going to be prone to hair loss, the level of hair loss though will be dependent on a few very key factors:  How many androgens are in your system (dependent on age, genetics, diet, if you use exogenous sources of synthetic hormones, etc.) The types of androgens in your system (for those who don’t take steroids this will only be DHT from your natural Testosterone’s conversion, as well as the androgenic activity of Testosterone itself) Androgen receptor sensitivity and how prone you are to follicular miniaturization from endogenous or exogenous androgens  If you are male, your gender in itself has already very likely sealed your fate in regards to whether or not you will experience hair loss or not. This is simply due to the hormone profile of a man. The likelihood is overwhelmingly high that you are susceptible to some extent. There are very few men on this planet who can make it to elderly ages with Norwood 0 hair lines and adolescent levels of hair density.  The Role Testosterone And DHT Have On Hair Loss Progression The unfortunate trade off of being a man is that you have significantly more Testosterone than women, which is great for all male specific physiological functions, but the downside is that men have way more DHT circulating in their system as a byproduct of those greater levels of Testosterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), is an endogenous androgen sex steroid and hormone that is a by-product of one’s own Testosterone levels. Testosterone is the primary sex hormone in men, and is converted partially via the enzyme 5α-reductase into DHT, which is far more hazardous to your hair than Testosterone. Not only because it’s more androgenic, but also because it has a much higher affinity to bind and miniaturize hair follicles than Testosterone does. If you have ANY Testosterone or DHT in your body, you are going to experience hair follicle miniaturization to some extent. The extent to which it individually affects your hair though will be dependent on the things mentioned at the start of the article, how much Testosterone is in your body, how much of that is converting into DHT, your sensitivity to androgens at the hair follicle, and which hormones are circulating in your system. Those who use supraphyisological amounts of exogenous Steroids will be expediting their rate of hair follicle miniaturization, again, depending on how androgenic the compounds are, how much is used, personal sensitivity to that particular androgen, etc. According to The American Hair Loss Association: “Androgenetic Alopecia or common male pattern baldness (MPB) accounts for more than 95% of hair loss in men. By the age of thirty-five two-thirds of American men will experience some degree of appreciable hair loss, and by the age of fifty approximately 85% of men have significantly thinning hair.” Androgenetic Alopecia is caused by the miniaturization of hair follicles via androgens. Have you ever wondered why in old age women all have hair on their head still but most men have horrible thinning and receding hair lines? This is why. Androgens. DHT Levels In Men Vs Women As mentioned, the primary sex hormone in Men is Testosterone, while in Women it is Estrogen. As there is significantly less Testosterone in Women, they have significantly less androgens, and with significantly less androgens, they expectedly have minimal body hair growth, minimal hair loss, and minimal masculinity in general. Men on the other hand, have far greater levels of Testosterone, and that Testosterone either binds to androgen receptors (including at the hair follicle), or it is metabolized via 5α-reductase into DHT, which then can bind to the same receptors, but with a much greater affinity (meaning more miniaturization). Expectedly, men have far greater amounts of body hair growth, far more hair loss, and develop masculine characteristics. Even women can suffer from androgenic alopecia via androgen induced hair follicle miniaturization; their likelihood is just far lower as they simply (on average) have substantially lower levels of androgens in their body than men. Shedding Vs Permanent Hair Loss Androgenic Alopecia (Male Pattern Baldness) is more or less permanent. Once those hair follicles have been miniaturized to the extent of a scalp appearing slick bald, there is little you can do to revive them. With that being said, there are extreme interventions that can completely reverse hair loss, even in individuals with that level of aggressive Androgenic Alopecia. The likelihood that those individuals would follow through with those treatments is pretty unlikely though. For example, one of the most effective ways to reverse hair loss is castration via female hormone replacement. Is that a realistic option for the vast majority of balding men, no it is not. Technically, hair loss is never permanent, however, the hormonal environment necessary to completely reverse AGA on a slick bald head can lead one to the conclusion that it might as well be permanent. However, there are a minority of individuals who’s hair loss is triggered by nutritional deficiencies, underlying autoimmune diseases, allergies, under-active Thyroids, and many other triggers. The thing you need to know about these scenarios though, is it affects the minority of individuals, and those aren’t permanent. The main focus of this article will be on androgenic alopecia, as it will make things a lot easier to understand if we assume there are no lifestyle or dietary factors being neglected that could be causing temporary shedding, which would skew one’s perception of hair loss progression. You Won’t Notice Hair Loss Until You’ve Already Lost A Substantial Amount Of It This is the main point of the article that I am trying to drive home and goes totally overlooked by most who are researching this niche topic. You are born with about 100,000 scalp hair follicles on your head depending on your genetics and ethnicity. As androgens miniaturize hair follicles, the number of visible healthy hairs starts to decrease As time goes on, you will lose more and more hair via hair follicle miniaturization. The rate at which this occurs will depend on what I mentioned already:  How many androgens are in your system The types of androgens in your system and their inherent level of androgenicity Your genetic predispositions at the androgen receptor  Some men have more hair loss than others simply due to a genetically higher Testosterone level (and in turn, DHT level), while others can just have a greater sensitivity to those androgens than the average person. Some men even have a genome that results in a lower amount of 5-alpha reduction of Testosterone into DHT simply due to their unique metabolism of sex hormones. There are a variety of genetic factors that influence androgenic alopecia. This is why some men go bald by the time they’re in their early 20’s while others can go seemingly unscathed for 20-30+ years. The fact of the matter is that those individuals who go seemingly unscathed, are undergoing the EXACT SAME process of hair follicle miniaturization, they just have a lower hormonal profile and/or are less sensitive to those androgens, and/or have a significantly greater amount of hair follicles to work with. Blonde caucasian men for example purportedly have an average of 150,000 hair follicles, in contrast to the average caucasian man’s 100,000. This means they have 1.5x as many hairs to work with, AKA they can lose 50,000 hairs and still have the same hair density as another man who hasn’t lost even 1 hair his entire life (which is impossible unless you were castrated as a child as any level of androgens will exhibit some degree of miniaturization on hair follicles). You Have 100,000 Hair Follicles To Work With Just because you’re 30 and you haven’t experienced hair loss, and all of a sudden you are noticing it for the first time, the reality is NOT that you suddenly got hit years later now that you’re 30, the reality is that if you’re noticing hair loss, this has been a cumulative progression, likely over years and years prior where your hair follicles have been slowly miniaturizing. The rate at which they are miniaturizing is just slower than someone who is very prone to hair loss, due to them having less hair follicles to work with, having a more androgenic hormone profile, or having a higher sensitivity and affinity at the hair follicles to the androgens in their body than you have. You can lose thousands of hair follicles without noticing it. It isn’t until you’ve lost 20,000 – 30,000 hairs (rough estimate) that you can really start blatantly seeing some sort of hair loss progression. So, despite going through all these years “not genetically prone” to hair loss, the truth is you just haven’t lost enough hair on your head yet to notice it. I thought I was immune to hair loss from ages 18-22. I was convinced that I had perfect hair genetics, as I could take any drug I wanted (Testosterone, Tren, Dianabol, etc.) and still have perfect looking hair. Then, one day under harsh down lighting in a club bathroom I noticed in the mirror that I could see my scalp a bit through my hair line. It was faint, but it was my first time noticing it. I had to strategically move my hair around a bit at the front to cover it up, and then I forgot about it for a while and totally disregarded it (horrible idea). Fast forward a few months later and I was starting to notice it even more, with even more blatant diffuse thinning at the front, and then I actually started to consider the possibility that I was experiencing hair loss. Was it that I suddenly got hit with hair loss at 22 years old but I was immune up until that point? No, the reality was that I had probably lost about 30,000 hairs from ages 16-22, and it wasn’t until I had lost 20-30% density that I was able to confirm that without a doubt I was experiencing androgenic alopecia. An Ounce Of Prevention Is Worth A Pound Of Cure If there’s one overriding thing I want to drive home to as many readers, listeners and viewers as possible through my hair loss prevention articles and videos, it is that prevention BEFORE you start noticing hair loss is the most important thing you can do when it comes to hair loss prevention. I don’t care who you are, what you take or don’t take. If you are a male, and have 2 functioning balls that produce Testosterone, you are probably going to lose your hair, period. There is absolutely nothing you can do about it. If you have male sex hormones in your body, they will perform the physiological functions they are meant to carry out regardless if you want them to or not, and one of the unfortunate side effects of those hormones is the miniaturization of hair follicles on the scalp. Sure, you might not have horrible looking hair loss until you’re in your 30’s, 40’s (if you’re incredibly lucky), or even 50’s (if you’re a genetic freak with an incredibly low sensitivity to androgens), but you will experience hair loss to some extent. Now, you might not care, and that’s totally fine, there are plenty of guys who don’t mind hair loss and are not willing to take drugs or even bother attempting to prevent their body from progressing on their natural genetically predisposed path. But, if you are reading this article, it is quite likely that you do care about keeping your hair, and if you do, I STRONGLY urge you to start a hair loss prevention protocol right now if you haven’t already. Tackle Androgens First, Worry About Growth Stimulation Later The sooner you tackle androgen miniaturization via combatting Testosterone and DHT in the body, the more hair follicles you can save from permanent miniaturization, and eventual calcification and fibrosis at the hair follicles. What will miniaturize your hair follicles and progress your hair loss are the androgens in your body. A huge mistake I see quite often are guys who think they are protected because they are on Minoxidil. Minoxidil does nothing to protect you from androgens, so despite Minoxidil having a great growth stimulation effect that will improve hair density, you will still be losing hair to androgen miniaturization if you are not using something to combat the DHT in your system, and perhaps even your endogenous Testosterone as well. The thing I always advise would be getting a hair catcher for the shower so you have a baseline reading of how much hair you lose in the shower on a daily basis, so then you can assess exactly how significant of an effect adding in individual things to your prevention protocol impacts your hair loss. Ideally you want to use as little as you can get away with to totally prevent hair loss. We don’t want to be slamming a cocktail of drugs off the bat if we could get the same benefit from just 1 thing. After getting a hair catcher, and ideally baseline blood work, getting a Ketoconazole shampoo would be the first line of defense, as it is the most mild. Microneedling your scalp would also be wise to start doing on a weekly basis. If this is all you need to bring your hair loss to a halt, consider yourself lucky. The likelihood though is that you will probably need to either introduce a 5α-Reductase Inhibitor and/or a topical anti-androgen like RU58841 or CB-03-01 into your regimen fairly soon to start combatting androgens more aggressively. Minoxidil, MK-677, PGE2, Castor Oil, and other growth agonists I prefer to reserve for down the line additions to promote greater hair density once a foundation of protection from androgens has been established. In Conclusion It is WAY more difficult to reverse hair loss than it is to prevent it. I still highly recommend you thoroughly research all of these options before you start using any of them, as they all carry an array of potential negative side effects. It will be up to you to weigh out exactly how important your hair is to you, and what you are willing to do to keep it. With that being said, prevention is a major key, and anyone who is serious about keeping the hair on their head would be wise to act early, rather than after it’s too late and you’re playing catch up.

    "content": "Paco Rabanne Invictus Aqua Reformulation Review – Still Worth Buying? (2018)     Paco Rabanne Invictus Aqua Reformulation Review – Still Worth Buying? (2018)  Invictus And Invictus Aqua General Response From The Public: I’ve wanted to buy Paco Rabanne’s Invictus Aqua for some time. The original Invictus was well received by the general public (and women most importantly). The fragrance community was not a big fan of it expectedly as it smells pretty synthetic, can be cloying, and just screams mass produced run of the mill men’s fragrance. P.S. many times these are the ones that women like most, regardless of how many guys in the fragrance community want to hate on it, Invictus was a compliment monster. How Does Invictus Aqua Smell? Invictus Aqua shares a lot of the same DNA as the original Invictus. It opens with grapefruit, yuzu and pink pepper. Aquatic notes start to become apparent as the fragrance settles and deepens, with violet leaf accompanying it. At the base of it at are guaiac wood coupled with woody amber and ambergris. Essentially, it smells like a toned down version of Invictus, with the apparent candy like bubble gum sweetness, with a splash of Aquatic in there. This makes it far less offensive, and also increases the scope of the audience it pleases. Who doesn’t like a good aquatic right? A solid inoffensive aquatic fragrance (or fresh one in general) is a must have for the summer time, gym, errands, school, and everyday activities where something heavier would be overkill. Invictus Aqua quickly became a lady killer and was a top men’s fragrance for warmer days, and it excelled in the Spring and Summer as a very strong go-to. If I were to make a list of the top summer-time/fresh fragrance panty droppers, this would be one of them. However, it was reformulated in 2018. Invictus Aqua Reformulation In 2018 The reformulation doesn’t smell significantly different, and if you ask for opinions up close on a test strip or your wrist you will likely get great reactions. The issue with the reformulation isn’t that the scent was drastically changed from the 2016 original; the issue is the performance has been completely neutered. The projection is decent… for the first hour. The 2018 Invictus Aqua reformulation becomes a skin scent very quickly, and I would not waste my time with it. I regret blind buying it. There are far more strong Aquatic alternatives that are not only far better in performance with just as great ladies’ reactions to the scent, but they are cheaper too. The Best Men’s Aquatic Fragrance Alternatives To Invictus Aqua: Some Aquatics I would highly recommend over the Invictus Aqua reformulation are: Nautica Voyage  This is not only the best cheap Aquatic on the market, it is probably one of the best Aquatics in general regardless of price. This is a low-risk people pleaser. Men, women, every one likes Nautica Voyage. Inoffensive, smells great, performs well, and is insanely cost effective. Some other amazing Aquatics that I would recommend: Versace Man Eau Fraiche  The freshest of all the aquatics on this list. This fragrance smells exactly how women describe an attractive man should smell after coming out of the shower. Mass pleasing and can’t go wrong with this one. Versace Dylan Blue  Strong compliment getter. Great performance, safe for use in almost any situation, and deeper/darker than your standard “freshy” out of the shower smelling Aquatic. Has vibes of Sauvage and Bleu De Chanel DNA. It doesn’t feel like a clone though, it opens sweet, citrusy and aquatic, and then deepens with a big hit of Ambroxan. Very masculine and strong lady-killer. Bvlgari Aqva Amara  This is for the edgy guys out there. This aquatic is STRONG and will be more polarizing. You love it, or you hate it. But when you love it, you LOVE it. This fragrance is in a totally different category than most fresh aquatics. You get a strong hit of orange infused with aquatic notes. You will typically hear reviewers refer to this fragrance as “ocean like”. And it definitely is. It smells like an orange ocean. Charismatic, summery, fun, fresh, strong and edgy. Like I said, you either love or hate this one, it definitely isn’t a blind buy, so proceed with caution on this one. Should You Buy The Old Invictus Aqua Before The Reformulation? I wouldn’t advise going out of your way to find an old batch of Invictus Aqua. They are getting harder and harder to find, and they are all absurdly marked up as sellers are well aware that the reformulation isn’t as good as the original. It isn’t worth the marked up price tag in my opinion. Differences In Appearance Between Invictus Aqua (2016) and the Invictus Aqua reformulation (2018) This is easy to identify fortunately, so if you are dead set on getting an old batch of Invictus Aqua, just look at the bottle. The old batch is in a frosted looking bottle, whereas the reformulation is in a clear bottle. The difference is quite obvious so there won’t be a hassle having to email sellers asking to cross reference batch numbers with manufacturing dates.     \n \n \n Paco Rabanne Invictus Aqua 2018 Reformulation Review More Plates More Dates Paco Rabanne Invictus Aqua  3 / 5     Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

I started watching some of them and I liked how the diet was essentially a cross between Carnivore, and what an ideal healthy micronutrient dense diet would be. I have no known autoimmune conditions (as of now), so going full blown carnivore seemed out of the question, and I have greater piece of mind knowing I’m hitting micronutrient demands, alongside my macros each day for performance and muscular recovery. That isn’t to write off the Carnivore Diet though, as that is something I may explore later this year, or in 2019 once I’ve given this diet a fair shake. Honestly, I haven’t included red meat for years in my diet, and it was largely due to how calorie dense they are (I can eat more food and achieve greater satiety via chicken and egg whites), as well as a misconception behind how clogged arteries and cardiovascular disease really occur, and a lack of connecting the dots between the fact that (anecdotally) cases of heart disease “caused by red meat” are typically coupled with insane amounts of inflammation and poor gut health caused by the ingestion of processed foods and other garbage. Gut health has become a focus of mine, and that was also what drew me in, as that is one of the things this diet seemed to focus heavily on. The thing that pushed me over the edge and had me decide I need to try this for myself was the mental clarity that has been reported by those on the diet, as well as an upregulation in Thyroid hormone production. I have essentially abused T3 and T4 for years intermittently to artificially maintain a high-normal borderline hyperthyroid level, but it hadn’t occurred to me that this could be interfering with several other incredibly important physiological functions my body is not able to carry out without that natural secretion and conversion from TSH > T4 > T3 occurring in my system. There are other functions these hormones serve outside the realm of purely maintaining your metabolism, and I didn’t take that into account. Despite my reliance on exogenous thyroid hormones, my body temperature has been running fairly low for quite some time. Granted, I walk around at sub 10% body fat year round, but for someone who is eating 3000 calories per day, I shouldn’t be waking up with borderline Hypothermic body temperatures. I need to try getting off of Thyroid hormones and see what my body can do naturally when it’s completely maxed out. Iodine, sodium, and proper overall electrolyte balance have been neglected areas of my diet, and this Vertical Diet seemed to focus strongly on ensuring those are completely maxed out on a daily basis. My diet has never been bad; honestly to the average person they would think I’m the walking embodiment of health. I have a solid body composition (6 foot 1 · 210 pounds · ~ 9% body fat), I limit my sugar intake, I hardly ever touch junk food, I eat lean protein sources, I workout 4-5x per week, I regularly do cardio. While this is all good, if you aren’t hitting some basic dietary necessities, you will not be able to maintain a high quality of health in all aspects. After watching about 10 hours of content strictly on the Vertical Diet, I decided to buy it and give it a try.  My Main Goals During The Vertical Diet:  Upregulate thyroid function as much as possible  Monitored via regular waking and midday body temperature readings, blood work, hair shedding (I can tell when there is even a slight shift in regards to this), and overall energy levels.   Enhanced cognitive function  Avoiding intense blood sugar fluctuation induced mental comas and hitting micronutrient needs should take care of this, but this remains to be seen   Optimize gut health  Pretty easy to monitor how well my body is processing foods. I will be also looking at inflammation levels in lab work to see how I respond internally to these foods   Hit all micronutrient needs  Secondary Goals:  Increase HDL cholesterol  I have low HDL levels. I’ve had low levels for a couple years now actually, and I’ve just left it completely unaddressed. Adding in Citrus Bergamot and Cardio only helps so much when you’re on TRT and genetically predisposed to crap HDL levels. I’m hoping the diet can fix this. I will determine this by comparing mid-diet blood work to my baseline blood work.   See how optimal sodium, potassium and water levels will impact body composition, performance and overall recovery.  Sodium and Potassium are two parts of diet that I’ve never measured. I also never knew how misguided some of the information is on sodium. Much of it coming right from our own Government. I will be consuming 8 grams of sodium a day alongside my regular 1+ gallon of water I drink per day and monitoring changes closely   Decrease resting heart rate and blood pressure  My resting heart rate is about 65-70 right now. I would be a lot happier if it was closer to the high 50’s. My blood pressure averages about 125/75, although sometimes it goes as high as 129/80 at rest. I want to try and bring this down, and am hoping that proper mineral/electrolyte balance, HITT cardio, and the other parts of the diet will help accomplish this.    I am hoping that these secondary goals will be accomplished as a byproduct of accomplishing the main goals. I have already taken baseline blood work, grocery shopped, and have started the diet. I will be making regular updates here, and will keep you all posted on my thoughts as this diet progresses, and eventually post an overall review of my thoughts and if I was able to accomplish my goals I set in this introduction post.

    "content": "Finasteride Gynecomastia – How To Prevent Yourself From Getting Gyno On Finasteride     A huge concern for many individuals before getting on Finasteride, and while they are actually on it, is the possibility of getting Gynecomastia (gyno).   Table of Contents ToggleWhat Is GynecomastiaWhat Causes GynecomastiaHow Does Finasteride Cause GynecomastiaHow To Know If Your Estrogen Levels Are Elevated Enough To Induce GynecomastiaWhat Are Aromatase InhibitorsWhich Aromatase Inhibitor Should I Use For Estrogen ManagementWhich Aromatase Inhibitor Is Weakest And Which Is The Strongest:Getting Gynecomastia Even With Low Estrogen Levels On FinasterideRelated What Is Gynecomastia Gynecomastia is swollen male breast tissue that develops in boys or men. Gynecomastia is also commonly referred to as “man boobs”, or “bitch tits”. What Causes Gynecomastia Gynecomastia is typically the result of chronically elevated Estrogen levels. Gynecomastia can also develop in men when there is a decrease in Free Testosterone, causing a hormonal imbalance via a state of Estrogen dominance. There is a certain amount of Estrogen a man needs to function optimally, and despite what many believe, having 0 Estrogen would actually screw you up and lead to a huge array of negative side effects, so don’t go Gung Ho popping Letrozole like candy thinking it is the solution here. The longer someone’s Estrogen is left out of range on the high end, the more breast tissue development will occur, and the amount that occurs is relative to how high those Estrogen levels are above the normal range. How Does Finasteride Cause Gynecomastia I get really annoyed when I hear people talking about how Finasteride causes Gyno and to stay away because it will give you bitch tits, and so on and so forth. If you get Gyno from Propecia/Finasteride, it is literally the result of poor hormone management, and nothing else. This is what you need to understand. Read this carefully. This is exactly what happens when you take Finasteride in steps:  Finasteride inhibits the enzyme 5-alpha reductase, which is the enzyme that regulates the conversion of Testosterone into the far more androgenic hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Dihydrotestosterone(DHT), or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) is far more potent of an androgen than Testosterone, and when it binds to the hair follicles it can cause severe miniaturization of those hair follicles, which is the primary mechanism behind what causes permanent hair loss. When you inhibit the conversion of Testosterone to DHT with Finasteride (the point of using it for hair loss prevention purposes), you are left with more circulating Testosterone because it has been inhibited from converting into DHT to a significant extent (by Finasteride). Testosterone doesn’t just convert to DHT, it also aromatizes into Estrogen, and when you have more Testosterone circulating in the body that means there is more Testosterone aromatizing into Estrogen as well. The official brochure from the manufacturer of Propecia, Merck, states that “mean circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol were increased by approximately 15%“. Estradiol is another word for Estrogen.  So, you have less DHT in your body, but you now have a bit more Testosterone and Estrogen. And remember at the start of the article, chronically elevated Estrogen will lead to the development of breast tissue. How To Know If Your Estrogen Levels Are Elevated Enough To Induce Gynecomastia If you don’t have baseline blood work before taking a drug that affects your hormonal profile significantly, your doctor has already failed you, and this is why you need to know WTF you are doing before you just trust that every doctor knows how hormones work. To be frank, the vast majority of doctors have zero clue what they are doing when it comes to hormone management, so you need to understand how to read your blood work yourself inside out. For your Estrogen levels in particular, the standard reference range (what is considered “normal”) in men is 15-40 pg/mL. The reference range on your blood work will very likely differ slightly, and may even be in a different unit of measurement, as every country has their own guidelines dictating what a “normal male” should be at. This is what you need to know and remember: The golden sweet spot for Estrogen levels in men is between 20-30 pg/mL. If you keep your Estrogen in that range forever, you will never get Gyno from Finasteride. If you prevent your Estrogen from getting out of range, it is physically impossible to start developing breast tissue from Finasteride usage. This is assuming that other endogenous hormones are also at healthy levels in the body, but I will delve into that later in the article as that is a less common occurrence. So, the first thing you need to do is go get a blood test. See what your Estrogen levels are, and make sure you get a copy of the test for you to analyze yourself, don’t let a doctor relay it back to you and just tell you “it’s fine,” because half the time they haven’t the faintest idea what “fine” really is. They’ll tell you your Testosterone levels are “fine” even if they are on the very lowest end of “normal”, when in reality that would only be “normal” for someone who is on the brink of dying in old age. Anyways, rant over. Get your blood work done. Get a Sensitive Estradiol Assay, and if the results aren't in pg/mL, use this Estradiol conversion calculator to convert it into pg/mL. If your levels are above 40 pg/mL, I would advise using an Aromatase Inhibitor to lower those levels. What Are Aromatase Inhibitors Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) are drugs that were designed to treat of breast cancer in postmenopausal women and Gynecomastia in men. Aromatase Inhibitors inhibit the action of the enzyme aromatase. As mentioned, the Testosterone in your body aromatizes into Estrogen, and it is accomplished via the enzyme aromatase. When you use an Aromatase Inhibitor, you quite literally, inhibit the enzyme aromatase from doing its’ job, thereby allowing you to reduce the amount of aromatization occurring in your body, and lowering circulating Estrogen levels. So, if you are already out of range, you should be on an AI. If you are on the cusp of being out of range and you hop on Finasteride which raises your Estrogen levels a decent amount, you will likely need an AI. If your Estrogen levels are already in range while you are on Finasteride, then you DO NOT need to worry about getting Gyno. The goal is to keep Estrogen in the sweet spot forever. If it never gets elevated, you cannot get Finasteride induced Gyno, end of story. I believe the sweet spot is 20-30 pg/mL and that is where I keep my levels year round to not only feel amazing, but prevent any unwanted side effects or impairment to my physiological functions and quality of life that could occur from Estrogen levels that are too low, or too high. Which Aromatase Inhibitor Should I Use For Estrogen Management To save you a bunch of time researching these, and this is something you will only learn from personal experience, this is the breakdown of all of the most relevant AI’s you will need to know about. Which Aromatase Inhibitor Is Weakest And Which Is The Strongest:  Arimistane (greatest margin of error, weakest aromatase inhibitor) Aromasin (high margin of error, fairly strong aromatase inhibitor) Arimidex (low margin of error, fairly easy to crash Estrogen unless on a high dose of aromatizing compounds, very strong aromatase inhibitor) Letrozole (minimal margin of error, VERY easy to crash Estrogen by accident, even on tons of aromatizing compounds, the strongest aromatase inhibitor)  If you aren’t on a bunch of aromatizing drugs (like using exogenous Testosterone or other aromatizing Steroids), you will more than likely only need Arimistane or Aromasin. I’d recommend a low dose of Aromasin. Note, a LOW dose of Aromasin. If you’re not taking a bunch of drugs that aromatize, and you’re just dealing with slight systemic elevation of Estrogen from Finasteride usage, you DO NOT need a crazy dosage. The dosage will depend entirely on your blood work, and there is no set in stone “use this dose and you will get to 20-30 pg/mL Estrogen”. No, it doesn’t work like that. You need to experiment, start low, and taper up slowly as necessary with constant blood work evaluation. If you are only a few pg/mL above 40, you don’t need to be hitting yourself with 12.5 mg everyday. If your Estrogen levels are closer to 100 though, then that may not be the case and you may need a dose like that. It’s all going to be individually dependent. But what I would do, in general, as you likely don’t have severely elevated Estrogen if you aren’t on additional steroids, is to start with 12.5 mg Aromasin (also called Exemestane) once on Monday, and once on Thursday. This is conservative, and likely won’t crash your levels. Get bloods done afterwards, and see where your Estrogen levels lie. If they are out of range still, gauge how much they have decreased, and then make a judgment call on how many more days of dosing to add. If your levels were 60 pg/mL and you took 12.5 mg Aromasin twice per week and it brought them down to 43 for example, then you might want to try 12.5 mg Aromasin once every other day. These are all hypothetical examples of course, but that is the approach I’d take. Once your Estrogen levels are brought down into range, you will never have to worry about Gynecomastia from Finasteride again. Getting Gynecomastia Even With Low Estrogen Levels On Finasteride This is a rarer occurrence, but there is evidence to support that some individuals experience a reduction in Free Testosterone while on Finasteride, despite Total Testosterone increasing by roughly 15%. Free Testosterone is actually the marker we care about, as that is unbound Testosterone that we can utilize, as opposed to Total Testosterone which is simply the total amount of Testosterone in the body, including the majority of it which is bound by Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) and Albumin. Free Testosterone is the only biologically active Testosterone in the body we can actually make use of. Even if Total Testosterone goes up, if Free Testosterone doesn't go up in parallel to it, you just have a higher level of present Testosterone in the body, but none of that is actually biologically active. In the majority of Finasteride's clinical studies, there was no effect on SHBG, and Total Testosterone and Estrogen increased by approximately 15% [R, R]. However, in some studies there was a noted drop of Free Testosterone, despite the increase in Total Testosterone [R, R]. A drop in biologically active Free Testosterone with a concurrent 15% increase in Estrogen levels in the body can lead to a hormonal imbalance. Anytime the tightly regulated balance of Testosterone:Estrogen is disrupted and Estrogen is too high relative to Testosterone than it should be, a man becomes more prone to developing Gynecomastia. It doesn't matter if that imbalance occurs via an increase in Estrogen (the most common way gyno occurs), or a decrease in Free Testosterone relative to Estrogen. If the body is in a state of Estrogen dominance, gyno can develop. DHT antagonizes SHBG and lowers it, which is partially why men will use DHT derivatives like Proviron to improve their Free Testosterone levels alongside their Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), and the data supports that lowering systemic DHT (what Finasteride does) would theoretically increase SHBG [R]. When SHBG increases, that increases the amount of Total Testosterone that becomes bound and is no longer bioactive or usable, consequently lowering Free Testosterone. If you fall into the unfortunate predicament of still experiencing Gyno development even with Estradiol levels at 20-30 pg/mL, you will still likely be able to prevent Gyno with an AI, as AI's will decrease SHBG and Estrogen in the body, while increasing Total Testosterone and Free Testosterone [R]. You just have to be careful about potentially creating low Estrogen side effects, as Estrogen is still a necessary hormone in the male body to mediate other physiological functions. Long term AI usage also has its own potential implications in regards to how it affects lipid levels in the body. Frankly, an AI is only a quick first line of defense to get your gyno under control immediately. You should seriously evaluate your diet and lifestyle choices as there are ways to inhibit aromatase naturally that are sustainable long term without the deleterious outcomes long-term AI use could have. AI's aren't healthy to use, so ideally you would want to transition off of it once you get your diet, lifestyle, and/or body composition in check to prevent Estrogen dominance from being an issue. If for some reason you cannot prevent Gyno onset with an AI by manually keeping your levels close to 20 pg/mL (rare, but I've heard of some anecdotal cases of this), you will have to consider incorporating SERMs like Nolvadex or Raloxifene to prevent Estrogen from binding to the receptors in breast tissue, which would then make it physically impossible to exacerbate Gynecomastia. Raloxifene is superior to Nolvadex in my personal opinion, and should be the SERM of choice for those who fall into that scenario.

    "content": "Bathmate Hydromax Review And Results – 8 Year Update     Bathmate Review  I’m sure you’ve seen ads on porn websites for random “sexual aid” products for sale, as well as in magazines, on infomercials, and in internet pop ups. All of those products being shoved down your throat are completely useless, and that is what has essentially tainted the male enhancement industry. There are so many products for sale that are just blatant rip offs that do nothing that the entire industry as a whole has been written off by many individuals. However, there are a few products that DO in fact work, and they work VERY well. In fact, they can add several inches in overall penis size (length + girth) if used correctly.  One of those (if not the best one) is the Bathmate. Read This Before You Buy A Bathmate If you are interested in learning more about this device first (highly recommended), the following guest post written by my good friend Chris Deoudes from Good Looking Loser contains legitimate, provable information, with several unbiased Bathmate reviews describing in great detail EXACTLY what to expect. He literally has almost a decade of PE under his belt now (no pun intended), and his Bathmate review will be the most accurate one you will find on the internet by far. He details:    Manual exercises vs Bathmate (as well as coupled together) The best PE routine for length and/or girth How to approach PE in general How to get a bigger Penis without devices or pumps (if you're strapped for cash you can still get amazing gains without any devices at all) Several extremely detailed Bathmate reviews and Bathmate results stories, along with links to where you can find plenty of other unbiased Bathmate before and after user testimonials Pictures and videos of his Bathmate results and helpful tips linked from here for you to see for reference (NSFW)    Without further ado – How to Increase Your Penis Size  (All About Male Enhancement that ACTUALLY Works) Welcome to Good Looking Loser. I'm going to give you a quick rundown of ‘Male Enhancement' (What Actually Works to Make Your Dick Bigger), what is realistic, what works, what doesn't and a simple way to do it and keep your gains without committing huge blocks of time. Does “Penis Enhancement” (PE) Actually Work? Yes. Some of it does. Despite the reputation of this scam-infested industry a handful of things that DO WORK. The rest of the industry is largely a scam however. Case in point –      “Do ‘Penis Pills' Actually Work?”      We'll cover what DOES WORK and what you can reasonably expect if you commit to a routine. *source: Journal of Urology What Are Realistic Expectations?  (How Much Can I Really Increase My Penis Size If I Do This?) Realistically – If you use my suggestions, you can gain expect to naturally gain 1 or 2 inches (and .5 – 1.5 inches in girth). Most guys who take the exercises fairly seriously for 12 to 18 months can gain 1 to 1.5 inches – regardless of starting size. About .05 to .10 inches a month. Those who go the extra mile can gain 1.5-2 inches. If you are starting with a well-grown 8 inch cock, you can gain upwards of 2 inches since their is so much untrained tissue to work with. But ignore the sleazy exaggerated marketing claims – Gain 4 inches on your penis in 4 weeks! IT TAKES TIME and 4 or 5 inches of growth is absolutely not realistic. But you can gain 1 or 2 inches. Newbies will gain quickly. The first inch is fairly easy, the second is harder. But it definitely DOES WORK if you are serious about it. related –      “Does Penis Enhancement Really Work? (Keeping Perspective on Male Enhancement)”      *source: Journal of Urology Are Bathmate Size Gains Permanent Or Is It Temporary (Or PE Gains In General)? (Will My Results Go Away If I Stop Doing the Exercises?) Good question. The answer is yes and no. If you COMPLETELY stop training, you will lose about 50% of your gains. (mainly progress beyond 1″ inches) You will NOT all lose your gains. Maintaining your size gains isn't very hard though – If you train just 1 time week for 10 or 12 minutes, you will keep about 70% of your gains. If you train 1 or 2 times a week for 10 or 12 minutes, you will keep about 95% of your gains. It's somewhat like weightlifting – you need to make an effort get bigger and stronger, but maintaining your gains requires far less effort. I will discuss that that “bare minimum” maintenance effort later. If your question is – Is male enhancement worth it? I think so. I started at 5.25″ and broke 7.2″ with very significant girth. These days, I only train 1 or 2 times for 10 minutes every 10 days and I'm still 7″ and have kept most of the girth too. What is the Average Penis Size? (Lifestyles Condom Non-Self Report Study) Source: LifeStyles Condoms Average Penis Size Survey Results So What Really Works to Increase Penis Size? Newbies should become familiar with the “Big 3” –      Basic Jelqing Exercises (Demo Videos Within) Basic Stretching Exercises (Demo Videos Within) Bathmate Hydropump (Male Enhancement Device) *Optional* Phallosan Forte (The Best Penis Extender – This Is Something To Look At If You Are Very Serious About This)      There's some more advanced exercises and devices (like the Phallosan Forte), but jelqing, stretching, and the Bathmate Hydropump are all you need to hear about right now. Combining these 3, you can almost certainly gain over 1 inch in a year (or sooner) if you train 4 or 5 days a week. Jelqing (Girth & Length Exercise) Jelqing is a largely considered a girth exercise, but will help with length exercise until you gain your first inch. Jelqing alone basically got me close to my first inch. Stretching (Length Exercise) Stretching is solely a length exercise and is a mandatory part if you want to gain length quickly or gain in excess of 1 inch. If length is your goal, you should be doing these stretches. Bathmate Hydropump (Girth & Length) This one is great. The Bathmate Hydropump is the world's most effective (and fun) PE device that will add both length and girth to your penis. Bathmate was the very first product I ever recommended to our community and is much apart of Good Looking Loser as I am. Have a look at the independent user progress in our Bathmate forum. There are tons of Bathmate reviews in that forum, and none of them have financial incentive behind them (important). Don't just take my word for it, I encourage you to go checkout our forum and read through all of the positive, neutral, and negative reviews you can find. The thing actually works, but you need to see that there are others actually getting results from this thing too. There's nothing worse than buying something and then wondering if you've just been scammed by a smooth talking internet marketer. Bathmate keeps the process fun, immediately pumps up your penis for sex (partner will absolutely notice and appreciate your added size) and slowly but surely – adds permanent size over many months. After the first 30 days, use the Bathmate 5 days a week with a full erection for 12-15 minutes. Just stick the thing on anytime you shower and you dick will look significantly fuller temporary and permanently after 3 or 4 months.  What If I Don't Have the Time or Desire to Do the Exercises? (Can I Just Use the Bathmate and Gain 1 to 2 Inches?) Yes, you can skip the manual exercises and just use the Bathmate. The combination of jelqing, manual stretching and Bathmate is just the fastest way to gain size. You can use Bathmate as a standalone and get solid results. I can't make any guarantees, but gaining .5″+ in your first 6 months and over 1″ in 12 months is days a week is realistic if you are new to PE and only use the Bathmate. (you will also gain .5-1″ in permanent girth during this time) No jelqing or stretching required. Gaining 2 inches or more, however, generally requires a commitment to stretching or length devices. Most of these reviews are from guys only using the Bathmate –      “This is Without a Doubt – The Best Thing I've Ever Bought in My Life” (thehappynomad) “More than a Believer, I Want to Tell Everyone!” (Bawssbo) “All Hail the Bathmate!” (ReyBetancourt) “I Love Bathmate – Girls Pussy is Tight to Get Into!” (Billy11) “1 Inch in 1 Year!” (DukeXXX) “I Can't Believe It! I Gained My First Inch From the Bathmate!!!” (Maverick69)      In 2010, as a manual PE veteran, I wore the Bathmate for 10-12 minutes, 3-4 days a week and grew about .5″ in length (I had already grown .5-.75″ from manual exercises) and nearly 1 inch in girth. You don't need the Bathmate to gain size. If you don't have the money, don't buy it. At the same time – You don't need to do the manual exercises to gain considerable size if you use the Bathmate. If I had to pick between manual exercises or the Bathmate, I would pick Bathmate because it does the same thing, only faster. The immediate post-Bathmate pump will can do big things for you sex life too. These days, I only use the Bathmate a few days a week for maintenance and before intercourse. Bathmate is my #1 recommendation for Male Enhancement because it only requires a very small time commitment, it's super fun to use and it works long-term if you actually commit to using it. But again – You can gain 1 or 2 inches. Probably somewhere in-between. But not 5 inches like others will tell you. Here's a routine if you are only using the Bathmate –      “A Bathmate Only Newbie Routine (Day by Day for 30 Days)”       How to Combine Jelqing, Stretching and the Bathmate Hydropump (Big 3) I'm going to keep this as simple as possible. Male Enhancement is not rocket science. If you safely train and fatigue your penile tissue (and let it recover) on a daily basis, it will become bigger and stronger. Although the composition of penile tissue isn't completely identical to smooth muscle tissue – it's just like going to the gym. Train and get adequate rest – you will grow. As a rule of thumb – If you can't get a good erection (~90%), take the day off. Remember – Like the gym, your gains come when you RECOVER, not when you are training. If you are a total newbie to Male Enhancement, you'll want to use the first 30 days to get your penile tissue used to the training. Focus on that. If you plan to combine Bathmate and manual exercise, follow this routine –      “Ultimate Newbie Male Enhancement Routine”      Notice that you are not Jelqing/Stretching and Bathmate on the same day. After 30 days, you can combine the 3 on the same day. Just do a little more each week or take it to the next level by Jelqing just prior to your Bathmate workouts. (6+ month experience only)  In this Bathmate Review, the guy gained almost a full inch in 3 months only using a Bathmate. It's possible. I choose to give a more conservative estimate (1 inch in 6-12 months). What Is the Most Important Thing to Remember? PE is a marathon, not a sprint. Daily consistency is the key to getting bigger. IT ALL ADDS UP. Every Jelq. Every Stretch. Every minute in the Bathmate. You'll grow if you train consistently (3-5 days/week) and allow adequate recovery. You won't if you don't. On a final note – Losing weight can help you gain size as well. For every inch you lose off your waist, your dick will measure .05″ to .10″ longer. That's why virtually all the super hung guys you see in porn have beanpole physiques. If you have 20 or 30 pounds to lose, you will probably gain about .25″ to .5″ length.  This guy's Bathmate results are a bit more representative in my opinion. 1/4″ in 2 months. He is well on his way to 1″ in 6-12 months. Pour Conclure Male enhancement actually works. The exercises and the product I mentioned. The industry has a rotten reputation because the vast majority of marketing over-promises and the products (especially “pills”) do absolutely nothing. It's important to have realistic expectations though. You can gain 1 to 2 inches if you make a year-long commitment. If you have weight to lose or are already natural hung, you can possibly exceed 1 or 2 inches. (likely after a year) Like natural bodybuilding, genetic ceilings exist. A small dick can become an average dick. An average dick can become a big dick. A big dick can become a huge dick. A huge dick probably doesn't need to be doing this. Enjoy.

    "content": "How Much Time Should You Take Off Between Steroid Cycles After PCT     Does time on = time off? How much time should I take off after a steroid cycle after PCT? I get these kind of questions all the time. Regardless of what suppressive anabolics you were on (SARMs, AAS, Prohormones, etc.) a PCT phase may be warranted. However, there is a lot of ambiguity around the ideal amount of time you should off after PCT. There is a common rule of thumb that goes around the bodybuilding community, and that rule is that “time on = time off.” What you have to consider first is that this rule was designed to be a general overarching guideline to follow that will be satisfactory the majority of the time, however, this does not mean that this is always the best course of action. For those who are oblivious to how to read blood work or assess their state of health, it's a fairly safe rule in general. Even though it is generally applicable, you do not want to fall into the category of individuals who make broad uneducated assumptions about their health markers. You want to know what is going on in your body, and if you don't know how to evaluate your general health markers, get a blood test and learn how, as you will need baseline blood work before starting a cycle anyways. The ideal way to figure out how much time to take off after PCT lies in your current state of health after PCT. If you PCT properly, there are a couple things you need to initially look at.  Endocrine System Recovery Have your Testosterone levels returned to where they were pre-cycle (baseline)? Is your libido feeling normal, do you have any erectile dysfunction, do you have any signs or symptoms of lack of proper recovery? What does your blood work show? Does your hormonal profile look exactly like it did pre-cycle? Or are you still not quite there? This is the main thing you want to know first and foremost, as if you haven't had full endocrine recovery yet, then starting up a new cycle of heavily suppressive drugs is not in your best interests. Some guys take longer than others to bounce back. As you get older, it will take longer to bounce back as well. Just because you took your Nolvadex and Clomid for 4 weeks it doesn't mean that everything is just guaranteed to be back up to par. You need to have pre-cycle baseline bloods to cross reference with your post-cycle bloods to make a true and accurate assessment if you have truly recovered after PCT. Are your Total Testosterone (via LC/MS/MS), Free Testosterone, sensitive assay Estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels where they should be? Are your endogenous sex hormones back to where they were pre-cycle? Were your pre-cycle bloods healthy in the first place? Did you take T3 during a cut cycle? Get your TSH, T4, and T3 levels checked too. Were you pounding tons of high-glycemic carbs during a manic dirty bulk phase? Have you been using GH for a long span of time? What do your fasting blood glucose levels look like now? What's your Hemoglobin A1C look like? Are you insulin sensitive? Or are you pre-diabetic now and about to hop into another mega-dosed cycle with GH in it? There are many things that need to be accounted for before you just put your head down and go full tilt again on the good ol' sauzule my friend, and many of these things go totally disregarded. Don't be that guy, get your sh*t sorted and know for a fact after PCT you are in a primed level of recovery before going into your next heavy duty run. You want to get back to an ideal natural state that looks like this:  High-normal total and free Testosterone levels Non-elevated Estrogen in the 20-30 pg/ml range (not set in stone, but generally most guys feel best here) In range TSH, T4 and T3 levels Healthy fasting blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity  ^ If any of these are unattainable, then you should be looking into getting those addressed and fixed before starting a new cycle of supraphysiological PED's. Blood Work And Health Markers After PCT Even if you have fully recovered endocrine function, your Testosterone levels are back up and everything is firing on all cylinders, the other equally important factor you need to consider is an assessment of your state of health. How's your blood pressure? What is your red blood cell count and what are your hematocrit levels? What does your lipid profile look like (LDL and HDL cholesterol levels)? Do you have elevated liver enzymes? How are your kidneys doing? Do you have unaddressed sleep apnea? Do you have any ventricular enlargement or signs of cardiovascular stress? These are just some of the main things you should be looking at extensively prior to starting any performance enhancing drugs. A lot of guys will assume “my testosterone levels have come back and my balls look full again so I'm good to go to hop back on again”. This is not always the case. E.G. if you have borderline stage 2 hypertension, and then you hop on a cycle of Testosterone with some Deca and Dbol and your systolic and diastolic jumps up 30 points a piece, now you've taken yourself from the cautionary/borderline dangerous zone to holy Jesus get your blood pressure fixed immediately or else you will end up with renal failure, a stroke, a heart attack, or a myriad of other possibilities. The point is, if you have a pre-existing medical issue, and you don't have perfect bloods or health in general prior to starting a cycle you need to get that fixed before you even consider starting something new. And when you're on cycle ideally you want to only use compounds that your body responds favourably to from a health perspective as well. If you can't take Dbol without getting nosebleeds several times a day and your blood pressure jumping up 30 points, don't use Dbol! Use something else that doesn't make you a ticking time bomb. So, time on DOES NOT = time off Time off = however much time it takes after PCT for your natural endocrine function to return to baseline AND for you to get back to perfect blood work and an overall state of good health.

    "title": "SARMs Liquid Vs Capsules – Which Is More Potent? (Myth Busted)",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/sarms-liquid-vs-capsules/",
    "date": "2018-01-27T02:30:05+00:00",
    "content": "SARMs Liquid Vs Capsules – Which Is More Potent? (Myth Busted)     SARMs Liquid Vs Capsules There is a lot of confusion regarding which is more effective, SARMs Liquid Vs Capsules. There are several ridiculous theories and false statements thrown around the community purporting that liquid SARMs are more effective than capsules/pills, and most of the time these statements are simply deriving from misinformed individuals, or those who have vested interest in the profitability of liquid SARMs (AKA they own/work for/are paid by a company who sells liquid SARMs). At the end of the day, this is what you need to know.  ALL SARMs start as raw powder. No matter what. When these raw ingredients are shipped out from their origin, they are in raw powder form to begin with before being put into any kind of delivery system for administration to a research subject. Now, once that raw powder arrives, the decision must be made regarding which delivery system to use for administration to the research subject(s). Here’s the deal. When it comes to research chemicals, putting a raw powder into a capsule may imply it is for human consumption, hence from a legal perspective it isn’t as appealing for many companies to choose capsules. This is why companies who sell liquids sell liquids, not because sublingual administration of a SARM suspended in grain alcohol yields a higher level of bioavailability or other nonsensical theories. They are simply trying to be more careful legally. That or they get pre-made solutions from their supplier who already have their research chemicals mixed in liquid form, but typically if legal concerns were non-existent then I surmise every single company would be using capsules for the most part, except for a few particular instances where dosing in smaller increments proves beneficial (e.g. titrating up S4 dosages in research where small increments would be wise to utilize). Now, companies who are using capsules/pills aren’t using capsules or pills because they are any more effective than liquids, it is because capsules are more appealing to the end user typically (greater demand), have a longer shelf-life, and are easier to ship. All SARMs start as raw powder, no matter what, the compounds show up as raw powder from their point of origin. What you do with it then for method of delivery is up to you. Whether you suspend that powder in grain alcohol in a liquid solution, or cap the powder, the powder is still powder and works the same at the end of the day. Think of essentially every single drug, vitamin, etc. at the pharmacy and what form it is sold in. It is 99% of the time pill form. If bioavailability of pills was so concerning, would drugs ever be sold in pill form at the pharmacy if they were rendered ineffective by not absorbing them sublingually suspended in grain alcohol? No, every drug would be suspended in a liquid and sold like these liquid SARMs are, but they are not.

    "title": "How Long Should A Steroid Cycle Be?",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/how-long-should-a-steroid-cycle-be/",
    "date": "2018-01-21T09:47:38+00:00",
    "content": "How Long Should A Steroid Cycle Be?     How Long Should A Steroid Cycle Be? One of the most common questions I get asked is “Derek, how long should your steroid cycle be?” or “Derek how long should I run a cycle of _____ for” or “How long should my cut cycle be?” How Long Should Your Bulk Cycle Be (or your bulk in general even if you’re a natural athlete) One thing that needs to be understood about muscle building is it is a slow process. You cannot build an appreciable amount of muscle in 4-6 weeks, so even if you are on boatloads of anabolic assistance, doing a 4-6 week cycle in hopes of gaining a substantial amount of muscle is wishful thinking. A productive bulk (in my opinion) should be around 12 weeks, and should be longer for some. But for the sake of this article likely being read mostly by newbies doing their first cycle, 10-12 weeks would be more than a sufficient enough time frame to notice a substantial amount of progress. For more advanced guys, embarking on 3-4+ month off-seasons will likely be necessary at some point to be able to pack on an appreciable amount of new lean muscle mass. Doing mini-blasts of anabolics for 3-4 weeks like some guys are doing is almost pointless. All you are doing is getting some glycogen and nitrogen retention benefits, increased blood volume, and a minor amount of muscle gain. The compound(s) will have hardly saturated in your system yet, and barely any hypertrophy will occur by the time you are going off cycle. If you are bulking, your cycle length should be an appropriate amount of time for your body to actually accrue a decent amount of new muscle mass, and to build on your strength levels while you slowly taper up your calorie intake. How Long Should Your Cut Cycle Be (or your cut in general even if you’re a natural athlete) The cycle length for cutting on the other hand should be however long it takes you to get to your desired body fat percentage. The point of anabolic assistance during a cut is to retain the lean muscle you have, so it only makes sense that the duration of your cut cycle should be as long as it takes to reach your desired level of body fat. For me nowadays that is typically around 8-12 weeks, but I stay fairly lean year round. For you, that may differ substantially. 16 week contest preps are quite common place nowadays. When I was younger and did full blown unhealthy “bulk” phases where I'd gain upwards of 40-50+ pounds, my cut phases were always around 12-16 weeks to get shredded again. Now, keep in mind, if you are needing over 16 weeks to get shredded, your first major mistake was letting your body fat get so out of control during your bulk that you need over 4 months to get shredded again, OR you have something severely wrong with your diet/training regimen that is hindering you from making consistent progress. Assuming you don’t have a hormonal deficiency, it should not take anybody longer than 16 weeks to get shredded in my opinion. Running a 20 week cycle for example means you would be blasting anabolic compounds for 5 months straight just to have the assistance you need to retain your tissue all the way to the end of the cut. This is putting your body in a potentially unfavourable position from a health perspective for far longer than should be necessary to get in shape. In Conclusion Your cycle duration should be based upon your own individual goals and needs (as well as state of health) as opposed to having some arbitrary number of weeks predetermined by someone else on the internet who you may see as a credible source of information.

I stand so strongly behind this brand because I am entrusted to formulate the products myself, and use efficacious dosages of whatever I feel is necessary to max out the benefits of each product. There are no short cuts taken during formulation with half-assed dosages being used, I literally max out every single product that I create, so I stand behind them all 100%. The main problems in the supplement industry that I see are:  Companies cutting corners with under dosing products to get a better profit margin Companies leaving product formulation up to a “supplement expert” who doesn’t actually use these products themselves  One thing I’ve come to realize is that no matter how much you read online, you will NEVER know how a product really works until you have trialed it extensively yourself. Instead of regurgitating facts read online justifying the use of such and such ingredients, our products are based on science AND personal experience, and are literally comprised of exactly what we personally use that has drastically improved the quality of our lives. Our flagship products are “Gorilla Mind” and “Gorilla Mode” which are based upon years of Nootropic and pre-workout self-experimentation and research.

    "content": "The Best Anti-Aging Serum For Men – Gorilla Restorative Youth Serum     Gorilla Restorative Youth Serum is our premium anti-aging Hyaluronic Acid formula that I helped develop for Gorilla Mind. This is exactly what you can expect:  Hydrates your skin Firms and tightens your skin’s appearance Noticeably reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Fades age and sun spots Shrinks pores Helps clear up acne and prevent future breakouts Improves Rosacea and Melasma Boosts Collagen Scent free, and dries quickly  This is truly the most LOADED Hyaluronic Acid formula available over the counter. You will not find an anti-aging serum like this anywhere for an affordable price, and if you have yet to a try a fully loaded cosmetic like this on a daily basis, you are in for a nice surprise. (You would pay $100+ if you purchased this at a Spa)  I truly believe that Gorilla Youth Serum is so effective (as well as cost effective) that it is the best anti-aging serum on the market. While the cosmetic industry is full of scam products that promise the world and 99% of the time can’t capitalize, Gorilla Youth Serum contains the only truly effective ingredients that work. The ingredients in Gorilla Youth Serum are Chris Deoudes’ (from GoodLookingLoser.com) secret for looking younger now at 35 years old than he did in his mid-late twenties.    Some Reviews    Product Label/Directions Of Use After cleansing skin, apply desired amount of Gorilla Youth Serum to your entire face and neck using gentle patting motions. Gorilla Youth Serum can be used alone, or with a moisturizer. Apply daily. Once in the morning and once at night, or as directed by a Dermatologist. Ingredients  ​Gorilla Youth Serum is made in a FDA and EPA registered facility in the United States and features certified organic ingredients. Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Aloe Vera), Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Soluble Collagen, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Algae (Seaweed) Extract, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Allantoin Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Aloe Vera): Aloe contains many different antioxidants that keep the skin hydrated and firm. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that reduce skin inflammation, and expedite the healing process. It is commonly used to effectively heal eczema, acne and psoriasis. Aloe also helps treat sunburns, and acts as a fantastic moisturizer without giving a greasy feel to the skin, or contributing to an oily complexion [1,2,3]. Hyaluronic Acid: Hyaluronic Acid is naturally occurring in the body, and it is present between the skin cells. This is what is largely responsible for providing most of your skin’s moisture and firmness, as well as keeping it plump, smooth, and wrinkle free. As you age, your Hyaluronic Acid levels in the skin start to diminish. This is very significant after the age of 40, and it is largely way skin ages the way it does. By using Hyaluronic Acid on a regular basis in your skin care routine, you can greatly slow down the aging process of your skin, and even take several years off of it in many cases. Every skin type benefits from Hyaluronic Acid application, as it increases hydration and skin elasticity, as well as reversing free radical damage. It quite literally draws water/moisture directly into the skin, and plumps it up, effectively reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles upon the first use for many individuals. All of these benefits contribute to the end result of an overall younger appearance to the skin [4,5,6,7,8]. Soluble Collagen: Collagen is an ingredient in many cosmetic products, as collagen is a mesh of fibers in the skin that greatly determine how young your skin looks. Much like Hyaluronic Acid, the amount of collagen in your skin diminishes as you age. Traditional collagen products on the market feature standard collagen, which is essentially useless as the molecules are too big to pass through the skin’s pores, consequently preventing it from penetrating the surface of the skin. Soluble collagen’s molecules on the other hand have been broken down into much smaller fragments than standard collagen, allowing it to penetrate the skin’s surface. Once soluble collagen has penetrated the skin’s surface, it has a firming and moisturizing effect on the skin by slowing down the rate of water loss from the skin. This keeps the skin looking more supple, and younger [9,10,11]. Algae (Seaweed) Extract: Algae Extract not only moisturizes and softens the skin, but it provides instant hydration and protects your skin from free radicals that cause skin aging. This is accomplished through a variety of antioxidants present in Algae Extract, as well as via a variety of vitamins that it is packed with (Vitamins A, B, C and E are the most notable) [12,13,14].  Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5): Panthenol is converted into Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5) once it penetrates the lower skin layers. After topical application, Panthenol works by improving skin hydration, reducing inflammation, expediting wound healing, treating sunburns, and adding a heightened level of moisture. It infuses water into the skin cells, retaining its’ moisture deep in the tissue itself [15,16,17]. Tocopherol (Vitamin E): Tocopherol is another name for Vitamin E. It works by hydrating and moisturizing the skin, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, tightening and firming the skin, and protecting the skin from environmental stressors [18,19,20]. Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil: Avocado Oil has a unique ability to penetrate the skin deeper than other oils, making it a great option for softening and moisturizing sensitive and dry skin. It has an abundance of Vitamin A, B1, B2, D and E and works by regenerating skin, protecting it from the aging effects of ultraviolet light and environmental toxins, and promoting an accelerated rate of healing [21,22,23].  Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM): MSM enhances collagen bundles and keratin, both of which are essential for healthy, youthful looking skin. It also improves skin elasticity, skin tone, and keeps the skin firmer. MSM also increases the bioavailability and absorption of the other ingredients in this formula [24,25].  Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract: Grean Tea Leaf Extract contains Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG), which not only has potent antioxidant effects, but also anti-carcinogenic effects. EGCG actually reduces the chance of skin cancer caused by UVB exposure, and has a positive effect on the body’s immune system. Green Tea Leaf Extract is also a potent anti-inflammatory, especially for UV related inflammation, and it has even proven be extremely effective in reducing redness and itchiness caused by Rosacea. It also supports anti-aging by drastically improving the elastic tissue content of the skin, which may support the reversal of even substantial amounts of photoaging [26,27,28]. Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C): Vitamin C works as a very potent antioxidant and anti-aging agent. Vitamin C improves skin hydration, evens out uneven skin tone, firms the skin, and protects the skin from environmental toxins [29,30,31]. Allantoin: Allantoin stimulates the growth of healthy skin and cell regeneration. It also soothes and softens the skin, all of which contribute to much younger looking skin [32,33,34].

Consider this product if you are over 28 years old, or if you look older than you are. For a guy who doesn't fall into either of those categories, I would just recommend taking measures to prevent acne, keeping your skin moisturized, and using sunscreen when you are in the sun for extended periods of time in order to delay the aging process. An anti-aging serum for a 20 year old for example would be a waste of their time/money. For someone who DOES fall into one of those two categories though, having an awesome anti-aging serum that you use daily can make a VERY significant difference on how old you look, and greatly improve your overall complexion.

    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/acp-105-sarm-overview/",
    "date": "2017-12-22T12:09:18+00:00",
    "content": "ACP-105 SARM Overview – What To Expect (Based On Clinical Studies)     What Is ACP-105? ACP-105 is another non-steroidal Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM). Acadia (the company that produced this SARM) proposes that ACP-105 is as potent as Testosterone in in vitro assays without interaction at other hormone receptors. In addition, ACP-105 demonstrates potent anabolic effects on muscle and bone with minimal effect on prostate in preclinical models (hence it being a genuine SARM). While the research (albeit limited) is promising, there are no clinical studies on human subjects; consequently any conclusions or theories we develop around the compound have to be taken with a grain of salt. How Strong Is ACP-105? To get a clear representation of just how strong of an effect this SARM has, each research subject undergoes ORX-induced atrophy (an orchiectomy), which is a surgical procedure in which one or both testicles are removed. This is the surgical form of castration. The point of this is that once the ACP-105 is administered to the research subjects, you can calculate an exact figure that defines how anabolic and androgenic a compound is, based on the fact that there are no longer endogenous hormones skewing the results, and the research subject is essentially functioning from a baseline reading of 0 on all accounts. 1mg/kg per day was given to the research subjects, and that resulted in a very blatant anabolic effect. The extent of this anabolic effect is measured in what % of hypertrophy occurs relative to the baseline that DHT would otherwise achieve had the research subject not undergone ORX-induced atrophy. The % of anabolic activity was determined to be 67%, with only 21% reversal of the prostate gland (which is used to measure androgenic activity). From this we can conclude that this SARM has an anabolic:androgenic rating/ratio of 3.19:1 There are several SARMs that have anabolic:androgenic ratios of 3:1 and up though, so this is fairly typical. While we can vaguely gather what we can expect from this compound (the comparisons that come to mind are Ostarine and S4), without knowing the binding affinity of the compound we can essentially only make shot in the dark guesses. We do know what kind of interaction ACP-105 has with the androgen receptor though, which helps shed light on things a bit more. Based on the information that was available, we know that ACP-105 is a partial agonist. Full agonists induce greater levels of suppression, but are more potent (based on the information presented). Partial agonists on the other hand, are less suppressive, but are typically weaker relative to Testosterone and DHT, which is the case with ACP-105. A fairly low concentration of ACP-105 attaches to the androgen receptor better than DHT does, and is blatantly weaker than Testosterone and DHT in general. In one sense, this is a disappointment as we are all awaiting the release of the end all be all SARM that is only exerts minor suppression, has minimal/zero androgenic side effects, and can rival or beat Testosterone in overall anabolic activity. This is asking a lot though, and it would be more useful to simply compare ACP-105 to the other most promising mainstream SARMs to determine if it has a place in a researchers up and coming test protocols. ACP-105 Effect On Speed, Endurance, Balance, Strength, And Motor Coordination One study in particular assessed the effects of the SARM ACP-105 on rotorod performance, which is essentially a performance test used to assess speed, endurance, balance, strength and motor coordination. Now, the study also involved exposure to radiation and was actually intended to see if mice that were administered ACP-105 would undergo the same degradation of rotorod performance as mice that weren’t on the SARM. The findings revealed that ACP-105 may offer protection against the effects of radiation, which is great and all, but the key thing to pull from this study is that ACP-105 was the main factor that offset the degradation of rotorod performance, hence we can assume that ACP-105 treatment might contribute to overall increased speed, endurance, balance, strength and/or motor coordination. How Suppressive Is ACP-105? ACP-105 is a partial agonist; meanwhile LGD-4033 is a full agonist (using this comparison as LGD-4033 has a lot of supporting data to compare to). Full agonists induce greater levels of suppression, but are more potent (based on the information presented). With ACP-105 in particular, being a partial agonist it would result in less suppression, although it will also likely be weaker than LGD-4033 on a mg:mg comparison. Raising the dose could make it formidable to heavy hitters like LGD-4033, but referring back to the anabolic:androgenic rating of ACP-105 (3.19:1), we can assume that the higher the dose, the greater the chance of suppression and androgenic side effects. This may still be minimal though, even at higher dosages, as ACP-105 appears to have a much less significant effect on prostate size than Testosterone and DHT. Based on the data provided, we can assume that a higher dose of ACP-105 may yield effects formidable to that of Testosterone, with a very minimal presence of negative androgenic side effects. So, perhaps there is a threshold dosage where one could achieve a stronger anabolic effect than something like S4 or maybe even LGD-4033 but with less suppression, but this remains to be seen as more data emerges. Dosage The studies done on ACP-105 suggest that the human equivalent for the study using 1 mg/kg per day for a man weighing about 175 pounds would be about 11 mg per day. Obviously equating this to some efficacious dosage where there would be minimal/no side effects for human use is impossible to do without some sort of experimentation being done, and as of now there are no clinical trials done on humans. The consensus seems to suggest that a reasonable starting dosage is around 11-12mg per day for human research trials. Does ACP-105 Require PCT? Anything that suppresses your natural endocrine function may warrant PCT. Conclusion This SARM seems like it may be formidable to some of the less suppressive/still effective mainstream SARMs (like Ostarine) from the data we have gathered, but the main appeal of it is that there should be significantly less androgenic activity than several of the stronger SARMs, hence less undesirable side effects.

If you don't already know what Nootropics are, they are a category of compounds that can improve cognitive function. This can extend into many different specific benefits, but the main draw of Nootropics is their impact on productivity, concentration, creativity and information retention. Gorilla Mind Smooth is our stimulant-free version of Gorilla Mind that provides a smoother, much less extreme level of energy, but still maximizes mental clarity, memory, creativity and focus. Regardless if you're currently using stimulant-based products (coffee, energy drinks, pre-workouts, etc.), cycling off of stimulants, or just never use stimulants, Gorilla Mind Smooth is the most potent Nootropic formula you can add into your life to enhance cognitive function.

Originally, I was trying to chase a stimulant-free energy boost in Smooth, which is why I had those ingredients in it. However, over the past year I've started to really lean towards reformulating Smooth to create an entirely Nootropic comprised formula that is 100% geared towards maxing out cognitive function, rather than chase a relatively weak level of energy that we already destroy with Gorilla Mind Rush. Anyone buying Gorilla Mind that is using it for the laser focus and massive boost in energy and productivity is buying RUSH anyways, not SMOOTH. Instead of wasting precious capsule space with things that achieve a subpar level of energy, I decided that space would be far better utilized with other Nootropics. This is what led to me creating the current Gorilla Mind Smooth formula, which now has 1000 mg of Lion's Mane mushroom and 500 mg of Kanna in it. These compounds are far more conducive to enhancing the SMOOTH formula by supporting actual brain health, creativity, mental clarity and memory formation. If you want ridiculous amounts of energy and drive, get RUSH. For those who want a true stimulant-free Nootropic formula, SMOOTH is even better now and I highly recommend you give it a try.  Gorilla Mind Smooth Vs. Other Nootropics On The Market This is the most maxed out stim-free Nootropic formula on the market. The full daily dose is 6 capsules. Even a half dose (3 capsules) is still far more potent than the majority of other Nootropic formulas out there at their max dosages. I formulated Gorilla Mind Smooth the exact same way I formulate any other product. I put in exactly what I would buy myself if I were shopping for each Nootropic separately. If you thought the pre-workout market was bad for underdosed products, your jaw will drop when you see some of the top selling Nootropic formulas. This industry is even worse because it is so niche and new. Preying on unsuspecting customers with garbage formulas sprinkled with vitamins and completely useless dosages of Nootropics is even more common in this industry. Because Nootropics are relatively new and uncharted waters for many, the prices get pretty aggressive on these watered down formulas as well that promise the world, and deliver nothing more than placebo. What's baffling to me is how many people eat up the marketing and blindly buy products priced at $60, $70, even $100 that probably cost $4-5 max to make. When the cost of bottles, lids, and labels costs more than the Nootropics in your formula, there's a f*cking problem. Fortunately, my audience is comprised of intelligent individuals who actually know how to spot value. It would be so easy to make a formula with a couple hundred milligrams of cheap choline that doesn't even cross the blood brain barrier, 100-200 mg of Bacopa Monnieri, throw a bit of caffeine in there for a kick, put some exotic sounding ayurvedic herbs in there, maybe sprinkle a couple low dosed Adaptogens in there, add a useless pinch of vitamins to make my label look more impressive and confusing, and then slap a label on it like every other company and then aggressively smash people with ads and market a high priced subscription model to the masses, or put it up on Amazon to compete with all the other loss leader cheap and ineffective Nootropics on there. The fact that the hypothetical piece of sh*t formula I just made up as an example of what not to do is actually still better than most of the Nootropic formulas on the market just goes to show how much some companies are deceiving their customers. If the majority of a company's budget goes into ads and sponsorships instead of product formulation, or they have a high ranking product on amazon, you can almost guarantee without even looking at the product that it sucks. Unlike what most companies will lead you to believe, there is no Nootropic formula that will lock you in like Bradley Cooper from Limitless (great movie by the way).  Just like our other products, it is me making the formula, and I put in what I would want to use as a customer. I used to spend time every day in University measuring out all my different Nootropics that were in my “stack”, and toss and washing random powders. Obviously it makes things much easier to just have it in ready to go capsules that are actually dosed properly. With my products, everything is turnkey. How To Dose Gorilla Mind Smooth Take 3-6 capsules in the morning, or spread throughout the day. Start with 3 capsules to evaluate your tolerance. While Gorilla Mind Rush requires more of a tolerance assessment and slow dosage titration over time due to the heavy hitting stimulants, you will more than likely be fine jumping head first into Gorilla Mind Smooth and tapering up to the maximum recommended dose relatively quickly. Gorilla Mind Smooth Vs. Gorilla Mind Rush While the foundation of Nootropics in both Gorilla Mind products are mostly the same, there are some key differences between the two formulas. The main difference is that RUSH has a handful of potent stimulants that completely change how the product feels. RUSH is the best stimulant-based Nootropic formula on the market for really waking you up and giving you tunnel vision focus and productivity. The strong backbone of Nootropics in RUSH are the portion that can actually enhance information recall, creativity, etc. But, the stimulants in RUSH are the driving force of the product, and can really be a game changer in productivity. SMOOTH on the other hand is stimulant-free and has the same Nootropics as RUSH, but also has 1000 mg of Lion's Mane mushroom and 500 mg of Kanna. Lion's Mane is amazing for supporting cognitive health, memory formation and mental clarity, while Kanna is a potent mood booster and can also support improved focus and energy levels. Gorilla Mind Smooth is significantly toned down in the energy department, so if you have too high of a sensitivity to stimulants or simply want a smoother level of focus, this would be more ideal for you. How To Combine Gorilla Mind Rush And Gorilla Mind Smooth If you don’t want to pick between either having the giant burst of energy and laser focus that RUSH provides, or the cognitive enhancing benefits of the Lion's Mane and Kanna in SMOOTH, you can combine the products. By taking 6 capsules of either, you will be getting a top end dose of Nootropics. Even with 3 capsules of either product you will still get an effective dose of Nootropics, and with RUSH, many won't even be able to exceed 3 capsules because the stimulant blend is extremely strong. If you are not a stim junkie who needs 6 capsules of RUSH I would recommend getting both so you can strategically tweak how much energy you want to get from the Rush to not over-stimulate yourself, but also reach the maxed out mental benefit you would get out of the Nootropics in each respective version of the product. Rotating Gorilla Mind Smooth and Gorilla Mind Rush Use Gorilla Mind Rush on days that require the most focus, productivity and energy. By rotating RUSH and SMOOTH, you can keep yourself sensitive to the stimulants in Gorilla Mind Rush, and reap the maximum benefit from each product during each use. Do You Need To Cycle Off Of Gorilla Mind Smooth? While SMOOTH will not cause tolerance build up like RUSH, I would still advise cycling off of everything for a week every month or so. Alternatively, allocate a couple days each week to days you do not take anything, including RUSH. Gorilla Mind Smooth Ingredients Breakdown L-Tyrosine – 1000 mg L-Tyrosine is an amazing cognitive enhancing amino acid that acts by balancing neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Its primary role is as the direct precursor to thyroxine and to the neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. L-Tyrosine shines in its ability to improve mental sharpness, focus, energy levels, and cause mood elevation [R, R]. L-Tyrosine Vs N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine L-Tyrosine is the most bioavailable form of Tyrosine. In short, N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is very inefficiently converted by the body to Tyrosine [R]. Even IV’ing N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine can’t elevate plasma Tyrosine levels to a significant degree, let alone via oral ingestion. Claims of increased water solubility and bioavailability are all marketing hype and were disproved easily by showing just how poorly N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine is at converting to Tyrosine in the body.  The graph above depicts arterial concentrations of N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine (NAT) and Tyrosine (Tyr) during intravenous infusion of N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine. As you can see, Tyrosine levels barely even budge. This is the same kind of tactic used to try and market new and “improved” forms of creatine that at the end of the day do not yield any additional benefit, and just feature an inflated price tag. In our first batch of Gorilla Mind, we actually had N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine in the formulas based on these claims of improved water solubility and bioavailability by our manufacturer at the time. After delving into the data further, I realized the massive difference in bioavailability and swapped out the N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine for straight L-Tyrosine, found a better manufacturing facility, and all batches of Gorilla Mind products since then have featured L-Tyrosine instead. Organic Lion's Mane Mushroom (Hericium Erinaceus) (standardized to 25% β-glucans) – 1000 mg Lion’s Mane is a Nootropic and cognitive-enhancing mushroom that has been used for thousands of years by Buddhist Monks who believed that it enhanced brain power and improved their focus. The main reason it is so promising as a Nootropic is the effect it has shown to have on the synthesis of nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurogenesis. By enhancing neurogenesis and potentially even attenuating the negative effects of cognitive decline, Lion’s Mane may significantly improve mental acuity, information retention, and decrease mental fatigue. Most products on the market contain 250 – 500 mg of Lion’s Mane. We have a full gram (1000 mg) in Gorilla Mind Smooth to ensure you are actually getting an efficacious dose of Lion’s Mane in when you use it. Effect On Cognitive Function A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 50-80 year old adults with mild cognitive impairment to evaluate the efficacy of Lion's Mane as a cognitive aid. The Lion's Mane treated group showed significantly increased scores on the cognitive function scale compared with the placebo group [R].  Enhanced Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) Synthesis Results from animal studies support that Lion's Mane can enhance the synthesis of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) [R, R].  NGF is required by neurons in order to survive and appears to play a major role in cognitive function. When NGF decreases in the brain, memory formation and information recall becomes greatly impaired. By maintaining optimal levels of NGF one may be able to support brain plasticity for improved information retention, memorization, as well as general cognitive health. Effect On Beta Amyloid Levels And Cognitive Decline In a rodent model, Lion's Mane was shown to attenuate the negative cognitive effects of beta amyloid in the brain (what is believed to be the main cause of Alzheimer's) [R]. It was also shown to ameliorate Alzheimer’s disease-related pathologies in several other rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease [R, R]. Mood Elevation And Stress Reduction Lion’s Mane also contains erinacine and other bioactive compounds that may increase dopamine production and improve state of well-being. One study showed that Lion's Mane supplementation reduced depression and anxiety after 4 weeks of use [R]. DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol) – 750 mg DMAE's mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it appears to work primarily by stimulating cholinergic receptors and has shown to improve cognitive function, energy levels, focus, and act as a neuroprotectant [R]. DMAE users consistently report improved memory, attention to detail, focus and mental clarity. DMAE Vs. Ritalin Study One double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted on 74 children with learning problems compared the efficacy of DMAE to Ritalin for treating ADHD [R]. The children were either given 40 mg of Ritalin, 500 mg of DMAE, or a placebo every day for 3 months. Behavior rating forms, reaction time, and an array of other psychometric tests were given before and after treatment. DMAE showed improvements in these metrics of approximately the same magnitude as Ritalin.  No major side effects were noted with either treatment with exception of 6 of the children on Ritalin noting appetite suppression. Alpha GPC 50% (L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine) – 600 mg Alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (Alpha-GPC) is the highest quality and most bioavailable form of Choline. Taking massive dosages of straight Choline has shown to have no cognitive effect in humans [R]. Alpha-GPC on the other hand has shown to cross the blood brain barrier and provide the brain with a rapidly absorbed form of choline. This then supports the synthesis and release of acetylcholine. The surge of quickly absorbed choline in conjunction with the release of acetylcholine helps support an array of cognitive functions including but not limited to memory, HGH production, physical performance, concentration, focus, and information absorption/recall [R, R, R]. Alpha-GPC has also shown to significantly increase strength and may be an effective ergogenic aid [R]. How Much Choline Do You Need Per Day? The Adequate Intake (AI), as established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Institute of Medicine, for adults is 550 mg per day for men and 425 mg per day for women. We all know how brutally underestimated some of the AI's have proved to be in the past couple decades, and there is evidence suggesting that the AI for Choline is also far too low. One study showed that 2200 mg per day of Choline protected against the DNA damage that otherwise occurred in people consuming only 550 mg [R]. There are not enough studies on Choline, and it is a severely lacking area of research considering how important it is for brain health. I would shoot for at least 900-1200 mg of Choline per day. A big chunk of that can be achieved through regular liver and egg yolk consumption, but supplementation will help you hit that number with much greater ease.  I eat 1 ounce of beef liver, 4 large eggs, and supplement with 600 mg of Alpha-GPC every day via Gorilla Mind. I also take extra precautions to support methylation, which I will delve into later in the methylation subsection. Alpha-GPC's Effect On Alzheimer's Dementia In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with Alzheimer's dementia were treated with Alpha-GPC (400-mg capsules) or placebo capsules, 3 times daily, for 180 days [R]. In the Alpha-GPC group, assessed parameters consistently improved after 90 and 180 days versus baseline, whereas in the placebo group those same parameters remained unchanged or worsened. The results suggest that Alpha-GPC is a promising intervention for attenuating the cognitive decline that occurs from neurodegenerative disease. Alpha-GPC's Effect On Methylation And Health Status The MTHFR gene codes for an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, or MTHFR. This enzyme is needed for the production of DNA and supporting methylation pathways that are essential for all bodily functions. Genetic variations in this gene results in reduced activity of the enzyme and has been associated with cardiovascular disease, neurological defects, some forms of cancer, and a myriad of other diseases and disorders [R, R]. Personally, I am homozygous for C677T of MTHFR, which results in a 80-90% decrease in my efficiency in processing folic acid.  The direct reflection of that in blood biomarkers can be high homocysteine and low B12 and folate levels. I determined this via a simple 23andMe genetics test.  Normally your body creates methyl groups by recycling Homocysteine to Methionine, as well as by converting Choline to Betaine.  When nutrient intake needs are sufficiently met, the body depends on these two mechanisms equally. However, if you are deprived of methyl groups or have poor MTHFR activity because of a polymorphism, you can change that and start to create a disproportional ratio of dependency on the Choline to Betaine pathway. If you can't create enough Methylfolate, your body will ramp up the use of Betaine and Choline for methyl groups. By ramping up Choline to Betaine conversion to support methylation, your body can become depleted of the Choline it needs to create Acetylcholine. Downstream, the depletion of Choline can eventually lead to impaired cognitive function, DNA damage, and can be deleterious to overall health. The prevalence of MTHFR polymorphisms and micronutrient deficient diets is so common nowadays that almost everyone could benefit from Alpha-GPC supplementation to maintain higher levels of Choline. I take 600 mg of Alpha-GPC every day on top of the Betaine and Creatine I get from Gorilla Mode (or Gorilla Mode Nitric when I am not taking stimulants) to support methylation, improve my health, and optimize my performance. Alpha-GPC Vs. CDP Choline Alpha-GPC raises choline blood levels much more than CDP-Choline. While there is some speculation around the fringe benefits that may come with the Cytidine component of CDP-Choline, in general, the main reason we would use either Alpha-GPC or CDP-Choline is to supplement our diet and raise our Choline levels. Alpha-GPC accomplishes this better than CDP-Choline. Our Alpha-GPC is 50% Choline by weight, whereas CDP-Choline is only about 18% Choline by weight. That means that you would need to use almost three times as much CDP-Choline to get the same amount of Choline as Alpha-GPC. Are any of the companies out there with CDP-Choline in their formulas putting 1600-1700 mg of CDP-Choline per daily dose in their products? Not even close. Many companies still use Citicoline (CDP Choline) in their Nootropic formulas, despite the fact that Alpha-GPC has shown time and time again to be more effective both anecdotally, as well as clinically [R]. From what I've seen, the most reputable anti-aging “biohackers” in the industry also prefer Alpha-GPC over CDP-Choline. https://moreplatesmoredates.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Rhonda-Patrick-Alpha-GPC-CDP-Choline-comparison.mp3 I have personally tried CDP-Choline and never really noticed any enhancing effect like I seemed to with Alpha GPC. – Rhonda Patrick (Ph.D in biomedical science/expert on nutritional health, brain & aging) Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum) – 500 mg Kanna supplementation has been found to effectively lower stress, elevate mood and increase focus. Personally, I notice a huge boost in my mood and I lock in a little bit more on whatever I am trying to concentrate on when I supplement with Kanna. Kanna was a huge success in our pre-workout formula because it also complements stimulants very well, which you have probably found out first hand if you have tried Gorilla Mode. Kanna works mainly via increasing the amount of serotonin available in the brain, and is typically utilized for its anti-anxiety and mood elevating effects [R]. This is an ingredient you will really feel, and can be especially useful for those days you need something effective that isn’t stimulant based. Anecdotally, a dose between 200-500 mg of Kanna has shown to be ideal for oral ingestion. Higher dosages between 1-2 grams have been associated with unwanted side effects like dizziness. Kanna has no addictive properties, and it is not hallucinogenic [R, R]. One thing to keep in mind with Kanna use is that it has a high affinity for the serotonin transporter. Therefore, it is plausible that Kanna can interfere with SSRI pharmaceuticals. Bacopa Monnieri (standardized to 45% Bacosides) – 400 mg Bacopa Monnieri is typically used as a memory enhancing Nootropic. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that Bacopa Monnieri can protect neurons in the brain from accumulative damage, reduce β-amyloid levels in the brain, and improve cognitive performance by modulating neurotransmitters [R]. The efficacy of Bacopa Monnieri has been reinforced in six high-quality randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trials. The results suggest that Bacopa Monnieri not only has the potential to attenuate neurodegenerative disease progression, but it may also be a potent memory enhancing agent in otherwise healthy individuals. Improved Verbal Recall – Bacopa Monnieri Vs. Modafinil Study In a meta-analysis, long-term Bacopa Monnieri supplementation produced more consistent and noticeable positive effects than Modafinil [R]. Primarily, Bacopa Monnieri was shown to be very effective at improving verbal recall. This suggests that Bacopa Monnieri would be especially useful for memorizing long speeches, business presentations, songs, scripts, etc. Apparently Bacopa Monnieri was used by ancient Vedic scholars to memorize lengthy hymns and scriptures, which would reinforce the clinical findings. Improved Information Retention And Memory Consolidation A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted on 46 healthy adults assessed the efficacy of supplementing 300 mg per day of Bacopa Monnieri for 12 weeks [R]. 23 subjects received Bacopa Monnieri, and 23 subjects received placebo. A battery of well-validated neuropsychological tests were used to assess Bacopa's efficacy as a Nootropic. The Bacopa Monnieri treated group had significantly improved speed of visual information processing, learning rate, memory consolidation, and state anxiety compared to placebo, with maximal effects evident after 12 weeks. In another study conducted on 76 healthy adults aged 40-65, Bacopa Monnieri showed significant improvements in information retention [R]. Another study conducted on 81 elderly Australians found that a Bacopa Monnieri extract produced significant improvements in verbal learning, memory acquisition and delayed recall [R]. L-Theanine – 200 mg L-Theanine is most commonly used for its calming and relaxing effects. I find that it also promotes a high level of mental clarity as well. L-Theanine primarily works by targeting the neurotransmitters GABA, Serotonin, Dopamine, Epinephrine and Norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters are responsible for feelings of attention, stress, arousal, relaxation and pleasure. By mitigating the over-activity of excitable neurotransmitters and enhancing the calming neurotransmitters, L-Theanine seems to help calm down the brain, reduce stress, and curb anxiety. This is why L-Theanine complements stimulants like caffeine so tremendously too, as it takes the edge off of stimulants that can cause jitters and over-stimulation. Stacking Caffeine With L-Theanine To Help You Get To Sleep And Smooth Out The Jitters If you get jitters even with low doses of caffeine, the L-Theanine in Gorilla Mind Smooth will really help curb that. The caffeine + L-Theanine stack is one of the most basic and effective Nootropic stacks to date. This is one of the main reasons why Gorilla Mind Rush won't send you off the rails despite having a very potent combination of stimulants in it (it also has a big dose of L-Theanine in it). If you love your coffee, green tea, or energy drinks and don't want the aggressive stimulant blend in Gorilla Mind Rush, Gorilla Mind Smooth will stack with your caffeinated drink of choice exceptionally well. One notable rodent model even showed that L-Theanine can partially counteract caffeine-induced sleep disturbances [R]. Improved Memory And Attention In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted on 91 people with minor brain damage, a combination of L-Theanine and green tea extract improved memory, attention span, and alertness during a memory test [R]. Improved Verbal Fluency And Executive Function In another randomized controlled trial, 30 healthy adults were given 200 mg of L-Theanine per day, or placebo. Verbal fluency and executive function scores improved after L-Theanine administration [R]. Stress levels also went down, and sleep quality also increased after L-Theanine administration. Improved Reaction Time In another study conducted on 18 healthy University student volunteers, 200 mg of L-Theanine improved attention performance and reaction time response [R]. Neuroprotection In a study conducted on elderly volunteers with normal or minor cognitive dysfunction, volunteers who ingested powdered green tea containing 47.5 mg of theanine per day showed significantly lower decline in cognitive function compared with that of the placebo group [R]. BioPerine® (Black Pepper Fruit Extract) (standardized to 95% Piperine) – 10 mg Bioperine is a trademarked form of black pepper extract standardized to 95% Piperine. Black pepper extract is a very effective CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor [R]. These enzymes break down molecules like epinephrine and norepinephrine in the body. By prolonging the breakdown of the cognitive enhancing ingredients in this formula, Bioperine extends how long they work for, and can also significantly increase their bioavailability. Huperzine A – 400 mcg Huperzine A works by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase in the brain, which is an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is not only a major regulator of cognitive performance, but it is also an important neurotransmitter needed for optimal muscular contractions during exercise. Huperzine A has shown to promote neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons in the brain) and act as a neuroprotective agent for existing neurons in the brain. In turn, Huperzine A has shown to enhance memory, focus and overall cognitive function [R, R]. Huperzine A is one of the most potent Nootropics that you can really “feel” and it complements the other Nootropics in this formula perfectly. Other Notable Compounds I Didn’t Include In The Formula And Why Noopept, Racetams, Other Synthetic Nootropics And Prodrugs Although they are effective Nootropics, Noopept, Racetams (class of drugs all named with the suffix “racetam”), prodrugs like Adrafinil, and other synthetic compounds that cannot be found in nature or in the food supply are not DSHEA compliant and cannot be legally sold as dietary supplements, so we did not include any. If this wasn't the case, I probably would have included 30 mg of Noopept in the formula. I also like Phenylpiracetam. Vitamins Vitamins are often included in Nootropic formulas to make a supplement facts panel look more impressive. If a company is willing to sacrifice room in their capsules to inflate their ingredient profile with stuff you very likely already get from diet or a multivitamin, that is a major red flag. More often than not, the dosages included are next to useless and are just there to make a product look more comprehensive. The main issue with this is that you only have so much room in a capsule. Most Nootropic products use a “00” capsule size in their bottles. Each “00” sized capsule can fit about 735 mg in it. That is precious space, and including a useful amount of vitamins in a product can easily take up several capsules of space. If a company is wasting space with vitamins and only has a serving size of around 6 capsules, they are probably just trying to hide the fact that the actual Nootropics portion of their formula is watered down garbage. Conclusion – What To Expect From Gorilla Mind Smooth In general, you can expect clear headed mental clarity, as well as improved information retention, creativity, productivity and concentration. Gorilla Mind Smooth is not designed to jack your brain into high gear, as that is a stimulant driven mechanism. Rather, it is purely meant to enhance cognitive function and overall mental performance. Try Gorilla Mind Smooth for yourself here.

    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/ac-262536-sarm-overview/",
    "date": "2017-12-12T13:22:57+00:00",
    "content": "AC-262536 SARM Overview – What To Expect (Based On Clinical Studies)     What Is AC-262536? This is another SARM that has no clinical studies on human subjects; consequently any conclusions or theories we develop around the compound have to be taken with a grain of salt. How Strong Is AC-262536? AC-262536 exerted up to 66% of the anabolic benefits of Testosterone, while simultaneously only exerting 27% as much Androgenic activity. From this we can conclude that AC-262536 has an anabolic:androgenic rating/ratio of 2.45:1 For the record, none of the SARMs that have been developed are entirely selective for anabolic effects in muscle and bone without producing some trace androgenic effects in tissues. The most notable being the prostate gland, which we can use as a gauge to assess how androgenic a SARM is based on its’ effect on the prostate gland to some extent. There are several SARMs that have anabolic:androgenic ratios of 3:1 and up though, and those are fairly typical. The highest ratio among the mainstream SARMs we are aware of is currently RAD-140 with an anabolic:androgenic ratio of 90:1. This doesn’t mean that RAD-140 will significantly outperform AC-262536 in all aspects, but it does shed some light on what we can expect as we increase the dosage of AC-262536 in our research (the higher the dose, the more androgenic side effects we can expect to start cropping up, as opposed to RAD-140 where you can expect significantly more anabolic activity than androgenic activity each time the dosage increases). The point being, the further you can get away from androgenic side effects via a more favorable ratio (and other factors), the more viable the SARM becomes for actual clinical application in the future (e.g. for treating women with Osteoporosis and other muscle and bone wasting conditions). The baseline hormone we typically compare ratios to is Testosterone, which has a ratio of 1:1. How Suppressive Is AC-262536 (and touching further on the strength of it)? The binding affinity of AC-262536 is Ki of 5nM. To put this into perspective, LGD-4033 features a binding affinity of Ki of ~1nM. Consequently, through mild broscience we can assume that it takes about 5x more AC-262536 to achieve the same extent of binding affinity as LGD-4033 at the androgen receptor. Meanwhile, this figure would put AC-262536 into the same general range of binding affinity as Ostarine and S4. One thing to note is that binding affinity isn’t necessarily the best/only indicator of how strong or suppressive a SARM is (although it should still be strongly considered). Another commonly overlooked trait is the literal interaction with the androgen receptor. AC-262536 is a partial agonist; meanwhile LGD-4033 is a full agonist (using this comparison as LGD-4033 has a lot of supporting data to compare to). Full agonists induce greater levels of suppression, but are more potent (based on the information presented). With AC-262536 in particular, being a partial agonist it would result in less suppression, although it will also likely be weaker than LGD-4033 on a mg:mg comparison. Raising the dose could make it formidable to heavy hitters like LGD-4033, but referring back to the anabolic:androgenic rating of AC-262536 (2.45:1), we can assume that the higher the dose, the greater the chance of suppression and androgenic side effects. However, AC-262536 had minimal effects on the prostate size. It was actually 14x less potent compared to Testosterone in terms of affecting prostate size. Consequently, we can assume that a higher dose of AC-262536 may yield effects formidable to that of Testosterone, with a very minimal presence of negative androgenic side effects. At the end of the day though, there is very minimal research done on this compound and megadosing it in hopes of replicating a near side effect free version of Testosterone could result in unforeseen side effects cropping up. Dosage The studies done on AC-262536 went as high as 10mg/kg and 30mg/kg on the rat subjects. Obviously equating this to some efficacious dosage where there would be minimal/no side effects for human use is impossible to do without some sort of experimentation being done, and as of now there are no clinical trials done on humans. Typically, researchers have reported that 10mg-30mg of AC-262536 is effective, however, this remains to be seen, as there is EXTREMELY limited data, even anecdotally. Does AC-262536 Require PCT? Anything that suppresses your natural endocrine function may warrant PCT. Conclusion This SARM seems relatively weak from the data we have gathered, but the main appeal of it is that there should be significantly less suppression than many of the more mainstream SARMs, and supposedly this SARM is still undetectable (so I’ve heard), so any drug-tested athlete would hypothetically be able to get a sizeable edge from AC-262536.

    "title": "The Best Pre Workout Meal",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/best-pre-workout-meal/",
    "date": "2017-11-29T08:13:07+00:00",
    "content": "The Best Pre Workout Meal     The Best Pre Workout Meal  The whole point of a pre workout meal is to give your body some readily accessible energy to push you through a grueling weight training session. Your pre workout meal should be comprised of the following if gaining muscle is the goal (in my opinion). Lean Protein Source First, you should have an easily digestible lean protein. One example of this is whey protein powder. One example of what isn't an easily digestible protein is a fatty cut of meat like steak. Definitely don't have that before a workout. You don't need a significant amount of protein. Keep the amount on the lower to moderate end so you don't get bloating issues in the middle of your workout. Typically for most guys, 30-35 grams of whey protein will suffice. This will be dependent on your macronutrient allotments for the day of course and your overall protein demands. If you are a tiny guy, you could use less, if you are huge, you will probably need more. Everything is relative; this is just a general guideline. Easily Processed Carbohydrates Second, have an easily digesting carb ready. Stay away from sugar, but get something that will digest quickly so that glucose is released into your blood stream by the time you're in the gym lifting weights. A good example of an easily digestible carb source is cream of rice. For most people, it processes quickly and causes no digestion issues. If you prefer another carb source, pick one that is clean and digests well. The amount depends on whether you're cutting or bulking, and how much demand the body part you're training will require. For example, on a leg day you'd want almost twice as many carbs pre workout as you would on a day where you're training a smaller body part like delts or arms. Choose the carb amount based on your needs, but don't have an excessive amount because that will cause bloating and discomfort during training. Slamming a giant cement shake of Vitargo pre workout for example (as well as intra) has proved to be counterproductive for me many times to say the least. The purpose of carbs in a pre workout meal is to provide enough energy for your body to burn through when training. Keep that in mind. Small Serving Of Fats Finally, have a small serving of fats. A good choice here would be a tablespoon of natural peanut butter. The purpose of having a small serving of fats is to prolong the digestion of carbs and protein. Fats are very dense, so they digest at a slow rate. By mixing a carbohydrate and protein meal with some fats, you effectively slow the release of glucose into the blood stream during your workout, which allows your blood sugar to be stable throughout your lifting session and provides a steady flow of energy to your muscles. Typically, what I like to do pre workout is have half a cup of cream of rice along with a tablespoon of natural peanut butter and 1-1.5 scoops of whey protein (I got this meal idea from John Meadows who is an awesome bodybuilding resource). The Importance Of The Rate Of Digestion With Your Food Choices One thing that should be noted is the importance of the digestion rate of the food you are eating. If you choose foods that digest slowly or take a long time to process, you won't be able to effectively time your glucose release into the blood stream with your workout, thus equating to less energy in the gym. In addition, if you choose a food source that doesn't agree with your digestive system you may end up working out bloated and feeling like crap, which is an extremely unpleasant experience. Pick only foods you can process easily and that don't cause any gastrointestinal distress. If your body doesn’t agree with the example I laid out above, find a similar alternative that doesn’t bog you down.

    "title": "RU58841 Results (With Before And After Pictures) – My Results After Almost 3 Years",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/ru58841-results-after-3-years/",
    "date": "2017-11-20T01:01:48+00:00",
    "content": "RU58841 Results (With Before And After Pictures) – My Results After Almost 3 Years     RU58841 Results – My Results After Almost 3 Years I have been using RU58841 for almost 3 years and I felt like an update article was warranted. If you have no idea what RU58841 is, I suggest skimming through my first RU58841 article I wrote in early 2016. My current hair loss prevention protocol is the following:  75mg RU58841 used after my hair has dried after showering at night Ketoconazole Shampoo or Nizoral every other day in the shower lathered into my scalp and left there for 10-12 minutes before washing it out  One thing I wanted to share is a transformation I made this summer with RU58841. I am very untraveled, and up to this past summer I haven’t traveled outside of the country for more than a few days. And I’ve never been to a different continent. I went to Europe for the first time in May and I didn’t arrange for any RU58841 to be shipped to where I was going. My hope was that being off of it for a month and just using my Ketoconazole shampoo wouldn’t hurt my hair too much. Well…. This is what happened after I stopped RU58841 cold turkey:  I had an INSANE amount of hair loss. I lost all density at the front of my hairline, and I was left with an almost completely bald spot there. Obviously this was extremely discouraging, and as soon as I could when I got home I got back on my RU58841 regimen. The damage had stabilized itself after about a month being home, and then the absurd over the top amount of shedding had subsided. After this, I started regrowing hair where I had lost it during my trip. Here is a before and after picture of my hair over the course of the next 3 months and a week (July 20th, 2017 – October 28th, 2017):  Just so you can see it actually progressing, here was the progression over the course of the 3 months from the first day: July 20th, 2017 – October 28th, 2017 Obviously RU58841 is still working well for me, even after several years. Up to this point (having to abruptly stop RU58841 periodically) I had been maintaining my hair very well with RU58841, even while on supraphysiological amounts of hormones. To date, I still haven’t experienced any side effects from RU58841. One thing you have to consider though is I believe I’m a hyper responder to RU58841. By that I mean it seems to work exceptionally well for me, but it may not for you. Just like any other hair loss prevention product (Finasteride, Minoxidil, etc.) not everything works perfectly for every one.

    "content": "Why Eating A Pro Bodybuilder Diet Won’t Make You Look Like One     Why Eating A Pro Bodybuilder Diet Won’t Make You Look Like One  This article is addressed to the people who aren’t as muscular as pro bodybuilders (99.9% of humans), but are still grinding day in and day out to gain as much muscle as possible. The most logical conclusion most amateur bodybuilders and gym rats come to is that if they want to look like their favorite pro bodybuilder, they simply have to train exactly like him, and eat exactly like him. However, even once they replicate their diet and training to a tee, they are baffled when they are left with a fat, soft physique that is a far cry away from the pro they sought to emulate. There are a few reasons for that, and they all too often go completely overlooked. Muscular Demand & Progressive Overload In Your Diet Most people understand the progressive overload principal, where you must slowly taper up the weights you use as your strength adapts to the increased work load. However, what most don’t understand is that the progressive overload principle not only applies for training, but it applies for dieting as well. Muscle requires a lot of protein and calories to grow, however, any excess calories that aren’t being put towards muscle growth are shuttled right into fat storage. If you have a 260 pound pro bodybuilder, and a 150 pound teenage kid, who’s body do you think demands more nutrients and calories to grow? Clearly, the 260-pound bodybuilder. The reason being that muscle burns calories and requires more energy in general to function and grow. As you gain more muscle, you have more muscle on your body burning calories and expending energy, consequently increasing your body’s energy intake demands. When your energy intake demands increase, you need MORE calories and protein to grow muscle than you did when you had less muscle on your frame. The more muscle you gain, the more calories your body will demand to continue growing. On the opposite side of the spectrum, we have a 150-pound teenage kid who wants to get huge like his favorite pro bodybuilder, and after reading an article on the pro’s diet, he decides to replicate exactly what he is doing. So now you have a 150-pound teenager eating the same energy demand that it takes for a 260 pound pro to grow muscle. When you eat such an excessive amount of calories, anything that’s not utilized for muscle building goes right to fat storage. So, if you don’t have pro bodybuilder size, you are simply eating an exorbitant amount of calories for no reason, as your muscle demands haven’t progressed yet to a point where you could even utilize all those nutrients efficiently. The end result is an out of breath; fat, confused kid wondering why he isn’t jacked. Been there myself. Eat what you need to grow, and that’s it. Any extra calories above and beyond that are simply wasted and are counter productive.

    "title": "How To Keep Your Gains While Still Getting Drunk?",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/keep-gains-while-getting-drunk/",
    "date": "2017-11-10T07:49:54+00:00",
    "content": "How To Keep Your Gains While Still Getting Drunk?     If you are dead set on going out for a night of drinking, let me establish a few tips and tricks you can utilize to minimize the damage done to your physique.  1. Don’t Workout That Day While walking around the club with a pump may sound appealing and like a good idea, it isn’t. The reason for this is because when you have a significant amount of alcohol in your system, your body’s ability to recover literally plummets. Your body will prioritize processing the alcohol in your system out before it gets to anything else, so if you breakdown your muscle by working out, and then go drinking, it is the most catabolic thing you could ever do for your muscular recovery and “gains” potential. 2. Don’t Eat After You Drink There are some weird myths that go around the night scene, one of those being that consuming certain food after you get drunk will help you sober up quicker and prevent a hangover. This is the most counterproductive thing for those who are serious about their fitness though for the exact reason I already touched on. If your body is processing the alcohol, any food you consume will literally sit in your stomach or get shuttled directly into fat storage. The only priority your body has when you drink is to get rid of all the alcohol in your system ASAP. Loading up on burgers and fries after you get drunk is just asking to further the damage done to your physique, as literally all of this food is going to be utilized poorly, and likely go straight into excess fat storage. Fat burning comes to a complete halt when alcohol is in your system, so keep this in mind if you want to consume calorie dense junk food after you go drinking. 3. Choose Hard Liquor Over Beer While this may seem like an odd tip, the reason for this is that liquor has 7 calories per gram. A 12 oz. can of regular beer contains about 150-160 calories, while most mixed drinks with diet pop are only around 70-80 calories. At the end of the night, you want to have the least amount of calories working against you as possible while your body fights tooth and nail to process the alcohol as quickly as possible. The more calories in your system when there is also alcohol there, the more fat you will pack on. 4. Drink LOTS Of Water Alcohol dehydrates your muscles quite significantly. As you probably know by now, having proper hydration in the muscle provides a much more conducive environment for muscle growth, and it also contributes to muscle contractions, getting a good pump, nutrient partitioning, etc. If your cells aren't holding as much water because the alcohol is dehydrating you, you are just putting yourself in a more catabolic environment, and you are also going to suffer in the gym during your workout the next day. If you have ever trained dehydrated before, you know first hand just how significant of an effect having inadequate hydration in the muscle cells has on your strength levels, and your overall workout quality. Drink lots of water throughout the night, and slam a litre or two before bed is my advice. Once again, I reiterate that alcohol is just counterproductive to the maintenance or progression of a good physique. If you do choose to drink though, use my tips above and you will be much better off.

    "date": "2017-11-07T07:53:02+00:00",
    "content": "Top 5 Things You Need To Do To Gain Muscle     Top 5 Things You Need To Do To Gain Muscle  1) Eat Enough Calories Calculate your maintenance level of calories with this calculator. I recommend using the Mifflin-St Jeor Formula option as I find it is the most accurate of all of the formulas. Start with a 300 surplus on top of your maintenance, and only increase your calories once your weight gain has plateaued for a full week. At that point, add 100 calories to your total daily caloric allotment. Rinse and repeat. If body fat starts to get out of control where your abs are completely disappearing, do a mini-cut for a couple weeks in a calorie deficit with additional cardio. This will improve your insulin sensitivity and get you leaner, putting you in a more favourable position to jump back into your surplus and continue your lean gain. Through this cyclical process, you can slowly pack on lean tissue with minimal fat gain, stay insulin sensitive, and have a lean muscular physique even during your off-season/”bulk” phase. 2) Incorporate Progressive Overload While you do see a lot of pros in training videos online doing relatively light weight for their size, this is typically because they have already reached their desired size and are trying to bring up lagging body parts and remain uninjured. You have to understand that a bodybuilder's source of income is their physique, so remaining injury free and maximizing their longevity in the sport is hugely important. I guarantee during their rise to their pro cards though when the majority of their muscle was packed on, these guys were all trying to beat their strength numbers in the gym each week and continuously get stronger on each movement. If you don’t try and get stronger, you won’t give your muscle a reason to adapt and grow. Progressive overload is your ticket to giving your body the stimulus it needs to adapt and be forced to grow to accommodate that additional work load. If this additional workload isn't exerted upon your body and you use the same weight for years on end, your progress will stagnate and plateau entirely at some point. 3) Be Smart With Your Macronutrient Allocation (type of calories you eat) This is an entirely separate topic that won't be delved into in detail here but in general, be smart with your macronutrient allotment. Just because you’re eating an allotment of 3300 calories per day to start your bulk (for example), this doesn’t mean that those calories can come from anywhere. Ensure you are eating enough protein first of all. 1.5-2x body weight is what I find works best and anytime I’ve tried to get away with just a gram per pound body weight I had crappy results. I'm not saying you need to do this, but anytime I've tried to follow the conventional approach of 1 gram per pound body weight, I've made horrible progress, and many times none at all. Also, unless you have a crazy fast metabolism be sparing with your carbohydrate consumption. The thing that typically stalls progress more than anything is eventually individuals have been pounding huge amounts of carbs for so long and have accrued too much body fat from overeating calories in general that they have a greatly diminished insulin sensitivity, and the result of that is an unfavourable ratio of weight gained. The weight gained of muscle:fat per pound gained from that point on just gets sloppier and sloppier as insulin sensitivity gets worse and worse and that person accrues more and more body fat. Use your carbs smart, as spiking your blood sugar and insulin severely with tons of carbs for no reason (e.g. on your off day when you are doing nothing aside from sitting on the couch) doesn’t make a lot of sense. Allocate your carbs in greater quantities to when you need them (pre and post-workout) and be more sparing with them at times when you don’t need them at all. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have carbs at all if you aren’t lifting, but just be more sparing with them when they aren’t as necessary. High carb days should be allocated to days when you are training big body parts like legs or back, as these are the workouts that will burn through the most stored glycogen. 4) Put Your Body In The Most Conducive Environment Possible For Building Muscle Put your body in as anabolic as an environment as possible to accommodate new growth. If you have a hormonal deficiency, get that addressed. This is why I think most men over 35 should get their Testosterone levels checked as many guys totally sell themselves short by operating on a sub par level of physiological function by letting their natural hormones go into the gutter. By putting yourself in as anabolic of an environment as possible I don’t mean go pound a bunch of SARMs, gear, GH, etc. you just need to understand that the more conducive of an environment your body is in for muscle growth, the greater your overall potential will be for gaining size. To what extent you want to take that is your own personal choice. 5) Do This Consistently For Years Without Giant Breaks This is the biggest pitfall. Anybody can have a perfect day of dieting and training, and lots do, but it’s the guys who have perfect days for countless days in a row that always make the fastest progress. I have seen far too often the inconsistent guys who actually look the same for almost a decade (I’ve been working out for 8 years and I still occasionally see some of the same guys I did when I was 17 and started working out and many of them look exactly the same). If you have worked out at the same gym for a long time I’m sure you’ve probably noticed that despite many of the people being regular gym goers, a large percentage of them don’t make any progress even after years. It boils down to them not being consistent enough in one of the areas I mentioned already, whether that be diet, training, or hormonal related.

    "content": "Can You Out Train A Bad Diet?     This video quickly elaborates on if I think it is possible to consistently eat a bad diet while still staying shredded year round by training harder/longer.  I don't like low calorie dieting. It makes me irritable, and the feeling of counting down the minutes until your next meal sucks. I can deal with being in a moderate calorie deficit for a long period of time, but extreme low calorie dieting (700-1000 deficit or more) I find takes quite the toll on your cravings, state of well being, and just overall appetite throughout the day. The number one difficulty that comes along with low calorie dieting for me is not being able to eat to complete satiation sometimes. I get distracted extremely easily when I'm hungry, and it is very difficult to get work done if I have food on my mind the entire day. So I decided to experiment and see if I could get away with eating significantly more if I just trained harder, and increased my cardio duration and frequency. On paper it makes sense, train harder and burn more calories, equates to more food you can eat and still maintain your weight. However, in practical application of this I just found that all that happened was I gained fat. It is VERY hard to out train a bad diet. I wasn’t even eating extremely poorly, but I was being much looser with my caloric allotment, and having a bunch of cereal and things I normally couldn’t have to maintain a sub 10% body fat physique. Even with training very hard, adding in volume and extra exercises, and adding in more cardio, all it did was run me into the ground more, waste more of my free time in the day, and I still gained extra fat. I came to the conclusion that unless you have an absurd amount of free time and are a work horse who just loves to be in the gym and long gruelling workout sessions, then you more than likely fall into the same category as me and will need to still be mindful of your calorie intake and eat at least relatively clean to maintain a very lean muscular physique.

    "content": "How To Replicate A HIGH Dose Of Pharma Grade GH With MK-677 And Peptides     So you probably already know how MK-677 on its’ own can replicate a modest dose of high quality GH (Growth Hormone). Mk-677 has a level of diminishing returns (once you pass 25mg per day), and it cannot replicate a very high dose of pharma grade GH no matter how much MK-677 you take. However, there is something you can add in that will potentiate each MK-677 GH pulse to an extreme degree. So much so that it will drive IGF-1 levels up to match that of a HIGH dose of pharma grade GH. (If you haven’t heard of MK-677 then I suggest you go checkout my articles and videos I made about it in 2016/2017 first). That addition is CJC-1295 DAC.  Also commonly referred to as CJC-1295 With DAC. CJC-1295 DAC is what I combined with MK-677 when I was younger (and cared a lot more about getting as big as possible) to replicate the IGF-1 levels that pharma GH yield, without having to go out and try and source pharma GH or pay the absurd price tag for it. If you don’t already know of all of the benefits of elevated HGH and IGF-1 levels, I wrote out a comprehensive list of them in my MK-677 overview article that you can check out. CJC-1295 DAC CJC-1295 DAC is a potent Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH). Do not get CJC-1295 DAC confused with Modified GRF (1-29) often abbreviated as Mod GRF (1-29), and also often referred to as CJC-1295 No DAC which needs to be shot multiple times per day with a GHRP to achieve a substantial benefit. It’s important that you know the difference as Mod GRF 1-29 is absolutely useless to use with MK-677 as you can’t manually match the pulses of MK-677 to the active life of the Mod GRF 1-29. CJC-1295 DAC is a modified version of the first 29 amino acids of Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone, together with addition of a “Drug Affinity Complex” (referred to as DAC). The combination of modifications and the addition of “DAC” provide a half-life of about 1 week, and steady blood levels after it is injected. While the mechanism of action behind MK-677’s ability to increase GH and IGF-1 levels is the stimulation of the Pituitary Gland to pulse out 12 very strong pulses of GH over the course of every 24 hours, the mechanism of action behind the GH/IGF-1 boosting effects of CJC-1295 DAC are quite different. CJC-1295 DAC results in a bleed of GH to be released over a longer span of time. It doesn’t stimulate short, strong burst-like pulses like Mod GRF 1-29 couples with other pulsatile GHRP’s do, rather, it simply amplifies the potential of the current pulses occurring in your body via this slow GH bleed effect, making them more effective and raising HGH/IGF-1 levels to a much greater level. Because CJC-1295 DAC has a long half-life, it produces a GH bleed effect, where the strength of every single GH pulse that occurs during that span of time that the CJC-1295 DAC is in your system is amplified several fold. Now, on its own, CJC-1295 DAC isn’t overly helpful when it comes to muscle building potential. But, combining MK-677 (which is a potent GH Secretagogue that results in several new and strong GH pulses in the body) with CJC-1295 DAC (which provides an amplifying GH bleed effect) results in a 1 + 1 = 3 type of results. By that I mean that by combining the two, they work synergistically to provide benefits that would otherwise be impossible to achieve with each compound used on their own separately. CJC-1295 DAC amplifies the strength of the MK-677 pulses essentially, resulting in sky-high HGH/IGF-1 levels. Mod GRF 1-29 Vs CJC-1295 DAC For Building Muscle Now, there are arguments in the bodybuilding world about why a GH bleed is bad, as it doesn’t match the natural pulsatile fashion of real growth hormone pulses from the pituitary gland, and strong GH pulses are what are necessary to constantly have throughout the day to build copious amounts of new muscle yada yada yada. At the end of the day, the fact remains that GH DOES NOT build muscle well, rather the pathway to new growth via GH use is completed with the constant systemic elevation of IGF-1 levels in the body that multiple daily shots of synthetic GH accomplish once they are converted in the liver. So, to get the muscle building effects that we want from GH, we need our IGF-1 levels cranked through the roof. Well, it just so happens that although CJC-1295 DAC doesn’t cause multiple short GH pulses like the human body is programmed to do, rather, its’ GH bleed results in a modest elevated GH serum and IGF-1 level around the clock. And when combined with MK-677, which acts 24 hours around the clock self-pulsing GHRP in itself (and a GHRH in some capacity as well), IGF-1 levels can get extremely high and stay extremely high for long durations of time. This = huge muscle growth potential High levels of GH = minimal muscle growth High levels of IGF-1 = greatly increased muscle growth potential If you want to make the most of whatever GH related enhancements you are going after, keeping IGF-1 levels elevated for as long as you can each day is the key to maximizing your progress. Pulsing Peptide Protocol Vs Peptide Induced GH Bleed Protocol With a standard pulsing protocol with Mod GRF 1-29 with a GHRP even shot 3x per day (the gold standard), you are achieving GH elevation for only 4.5 hours per day, and only 9 hours per day if you are hardcore and do 6x Mod GRF 1-29 + GHRP peptide shots per day around the clock. With CJC-1295 DAC, you are getting a bleed resulting in elevated GH and IGF-1 levels 24 hours per day, along with MK-677’s 24 hour constant pulses, you are sustaining high dose pharma grade GH IGF-1 score levels all day long. Here Is A Beginner’s MK-677 And CJC-1295 DAC Research Protocol: 2500mcg CJC-1295 DAC subQ inject before bed – Monday & Thursday (5000mcg – 5mg total per week) 25mg MK-677 before bed every day 200mcg HUPERZINE A taken 3x per day (600mcg total) With this protocol, you can reach an IGF-1 level of about 500ng/mL. This is formidable to a very fair dose of pharma grade GH. This is obviously dependent on several factors, as we know that IGF-1 depending on diet and amount of exercise performed in the last 24 hours will vary 10-15%. It is also dependent on that individual’s genetic predisposed response to synthetic GH, GH peptides, and GH secretagogues of course. This lGF-1 level should be more than enough for anybody who isn’t trying to compete at a professional bodybuilding level. For the record, this is the protocol I used myself when I used to use CJC-1295 DAC with my MK-677. Here Is A VERY Advanced MK-677 And CJC-1295 DAC Research Protocol: With this protocol, IGF-1 levels will exceed, or at least match a HIGH dose of pharma grade GH: 3333.33-5000mcg CJC-1295 DAC subQ inject before bed – Monday, Wednesday, Saturday (10,000-15,000mcg – 10-15mg total per week) 25mg MK-677 before bed every day 200mcg HUPERZINE A taken 3x per day (600mcg total) With this protocol, you can reach an IGF-1 level close to (or exceed) 700ng/mL. Which is absurdly high, and shouldn’t even be necessary unless your goal in life is to compete at a high level. The dosage for this protocol is a range because some individuals can achieve a much higher IGF-1 level than others with a lower dose, whereas some individuals need a higher dose to reach that same IGF-1 level. Side Effects The side effects from this protocol will parallel the same side effects you get from synthetic GH. In addition, MK-677 specific side effects include increased hunger from increased Ghrelin, and CJC-1295 DAC specific side effects include facial flushing (doesn’t always occur) post injection. If You Are Cutting If you are cutting and wanted to utilize this kind of protocol to replicate a high dose of pharma grade GH but can’t handle the hunger induced by the Ghrelin spikes from the MK-677, then simply swapping it out for another GHRP that doesn’t spike Ghrelin levels would suffice. CJC-1295 DAC works around the clock, so whatever GHRP you introduce will work several fold more effectively than it would on its’ own. However, to try and get close to matching the same kind of constant systemic GH/IGF-1 elevation that MK-677 can provide coupled with CJC-1295 DAC, very frequent injections of the swapped in GHRP will have to be done, as the active life of GHRP’s are far shorter than MK-677, with Ipamorelin being the longest lasting one of all at 2 hours. When it comes to viable GHRP’s to use while cutting, GHRP-6 is out the window, and I advise you forget about GHRP-2 as well unless you are one of the lucky ones who doesn’t get a hunger spike after pinning it (I’m not). The only viable options that are left are Ipamorelin and Hexarelin, as these will not spike hunger. I will eventually do a full peptide guide write up where I delve into how I would most effectively incorporate these different GHRP’s and GHRH’s in a cutting/bulking regimen, dosages, and what you need to know when it comes to saturation dosages and pituitary desensitization, which are all critical to take into account when you are designing your ideal peptide protocol.

    "content": "How To Get Rid Of Gyno Without Surgery – Raloxifene For Gyno     Once a lump has formed and you realize oh sh*t I have gynecomastia (gyno), there are only a couple options you have.  Get surgery and get the glands removed completely Try and reverse Gyno (the lump) with drugs  Now, the common approach most individuals have when it comes to gyno reversal with drugs is they tank the living hell out their Estrogen by slamming Letrozole, or they load up on Nolvadex. First off, Letrozole can’t reverse a fully developed lump, although it can greatly reduce the severity of it, as well as prevent it from getting worse. In some less severe cases, Letrozole can fully reverse partially developed gyno. Nolvadex on the other hand can fully reverse gyno. The reason being that Letrozole is an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI), and Nolvadex is a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM). The mechanism of action behind an AI is that it inhibits the aromatization of Estrogen, thus preventing the hormone that causes gyno from accruing and exacerbating the issue further. A SERM on the other hand acts as an antagonist and binds to the Estrogen receptor in breast tissue without activating it. The result of this is that Estrogen has no place to bind to the receptors in the breast tissue as the receptors are all fully occupied by the SERM. So, before delving into this further, let’s get this established: AI’s are used to prevent the aromatization of Estrogen, meaning they prevent the onset of gyno, but aren’t an ideal solution (or a viable one in many instances) for reversing it once it has progressed to a significant degree. SERMs can be used to reverse existing gyno, but it does nothing for preventing Estrogen from continuing to exacerbate the issue. So what does this mean? This means that if you are currently on cycle and are trying to get rid of Gyno, you need to be on a SERM for reversal, AS WELL as an AI to keep aromatization under control to prevent the issue from being exacerbated. If you are off of cycle and don’t have a supraphysiological amount of aromatization occurring, you just need to use the SERM. If you don’t yet have fully developed gyno but are starting to experience the beginning symptoms, an AI should be implemented immediately to prevent it from reaching the threshold of where it has started fully forming a lump and a SERM becomes necessary. Now, I already mentioned how Nolvadex and Letrozole are the most popular drugs of choice in the bodybuilding world, however, there is one VERY overlooked drug that I believe is the best drug for gyno reversal. The Best Drug To Get Rid Of Gyno Is Raloxifene I have no idea why this is such a rarely spoken about drug, but Raloxifene I have personally seen on numerous occasions prove to be the most superior drug for gyno reversal there is. Guys I know with pre-existing lumps from years ago have literally completely reversed them with a Raloxifene protocol, and that’s even after trying Letrozole and Nolvadex without success. Obviously what you do is entirely up to you, but just for your reference I’m going to show the Raloxifene protocol used for gyno reversal that I have personally seen work far better than any Nolvadex or Letrozole protocol out there. Get Rid Of Gyno With Raloxifene Protocol: Raloxifene: 60mg daily for 10 days ONLY. Then 30mg daily until gynecomastia is reversed. Recommended Supplementation During Raloxifene Treatment: Vitamin D and Calcium are recommended during Raloxifene treatment. 5000 IU vitamin D daily, and 500 mg of Calcium daily. This protocol above will take time. This is not a 2 week process. Reversal will require patience. But it most certainly does its' job, is more than likely side-effect-free, and is incredibly cost effective when compared to surgery. Also, remember what I said at the start of the article about being on cycle vs. off cycle. If you are on cycle with an existing lump that needs to be reversed, the Raloxifene protocol should be used concurrently with your AI of choice (which AI you use and the dosage would depend on how much aromatizing gear you are on, and your propensity to aromatization). If you are off cycle with an existing lump that needs to be reversed, the Raloxifene protocol should be used on its own without an AI. Raloxifene Vs. Nolvadex https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15238910 This study directly compares Raloxifene’s effectiveness in reversing gyno to Nolvadex. It was determined that “inhibition of estrogen receptor action in the breast appears to be safe and effective in reducing persistent pubertal gynecomastia, with a better response to raloxifene than to tamoxifen.” Not only have I seen Raloxifene prove to be more effective in real life cases, but it also has proved to be more effective in clinical studies done directly comparing it to the most mainstream/popular SERM for gyno reversal (Nolvadex).

    "content": "How To Get An Aesthetic V Taper And A Tiny Waist     How To Get An Aesthetic Tiny Waist When it comes to getting a tiny waist, there are a few things to consider.  First off, genetics will dictate the width of your literal bones, so if you have wide hips, there is nothing you can do about that. However, there are things you can do to make your waist appear VERY tiny still, even if it might not necessarily be. Objectively, it will appear tiny if you develop your physique to a certain level, and focus on some key aspects. Start Priority Training Your Back And Shoulders This means that if your current efforts are resulting in lackluster back or shoulder development, start training your back and shoulders twice a week, or hitting them with a higher priority over other body parts. Anytime a body part I have starts to blatantly lag behind in progression, the only logical thing to do is to give it more attention than the other body parts that are surpassing it in development. If you have a lagging back and train 5x per week with 2 rest days for example, a solid approach would be to do a heavy back session on Wednesday, and then wait until Saturday or Sunday, which would normally be rest days, and hit it again. This time, hitting it with higher reps with lighter weights to really drive blood into the muscles. If you can’t handle doing 2 entire back workouts each week, then start doing mini-touchups on it. An example of this would be to wait until your arm workout, and then to do 1 or 2 back exercises before you start hitting your biceps. Or simply adding 1 back exercise to the end of every second workout. It will take some experimentation, but essentially what you need to do is start forcing your back to grow by working it harder than you have been up to now if it has plateaued. By priority training your back and shoulders you can make the top of your torso appear much wider, which relative to your waist, will make your waist appear a lot smaller. By developing a crazy V Taper, you can effectively create an illusion that makes it appear as though you have a VERY small waist, even though that might not be the case at all. Take me for example, my shoulders and back are my two best body parts, and I’m not blessed with a 30 inch waist or anything crazy, but if you look at me, you would probably think my waist measurement was much tinier than it is due to the blatant V Taper I have developed. Do LOTS Of Lat Pull Downs, Rows, And Deadlifts I attribute most of my back development to these 3 exercises. I always start my back workouts off with some sort of lat work, and my favorite exercise is a simple lat pull down. I make sure by my fourth set there is a decent amount of blood in there, my back is fully warmed up, and then I hit a fifth drop set right after my fourth set where I decrease the weight by 50% and crank out as many reps as I can. By driving tons of blood into the lats and using the progressive overload method where you are constantly trying to get stronger, you can start to add width to your lats, which will give your back a more obvious v taper coming down tot your waist. Rows are fantastic for back thickness and development, and are what I attribute that “cobra back” look to. And then there are deadlifts, the mother of all exercises. These not only hit your back VERY well and add muscle everywhere; they stimulate your central nervous system and require exertion from your entire body as a whole. This is why deadlifts, despite being a back exercise, induce great amounts of growth in every body part, even if they aren’t directly being utilized during the exercise. Get Leaner The number 1 way to get a crazy v taper is simply to get leaner. One of the most common areas people hold fat is in their mid section and waist. When fat accumulates here, it starts to create a rectangle shape and less of a v taper. Once you get completely shredded and have no fat sitting on your waist, you will truly see how aesthetic your physique can be, and how much of a v taper you have. Despite my back being quite a well-developed body part, if I got very fat, you wouldn’t even be able to tell because I would be a walking rectangle. Once I get down to sub 10% body fat though, it becomes very obvious just how wide my back is, and produces a very aesthetic and attractive physique. Myths And Misconceptions About Waist Size In Bodybuilding Do Deadlifts And Squats Increase Your Waist Size? I’m not saying they don’t at all, but I think it is typically overexaggarated how much these exercises can increase your waist size. Personally, I have never seen an increase in my waist size from deadlifts or squats, and I know plenty of individuals who haven’t noticed any negative ramifications on their v taper from deadlifts or squats, and there are plenty of top competitors who are famous for their tiny looking waists but deadlift and squat heavy on a regular basis. Take Chris Bumstead for example, who just placed second at the Classic Physique Mr. Olympia.  He is actually quite well known for his heavy deadlifts and squats, and he performs them on a regular basis.                View this post on Instagram                      Haven't deadlifted heavy in quite some, no excuses just been being a pansy. Decided to man up last night and move some real weight. @strongliftwear Hoodie transition into the tank for the heavy set? #3Weeks A post shared by  Chris Bumstead (@cbum) on Apr 17, 2017 at 7:48am PDT   \n\n                View this post on Instagram                      It ain't quittin time yet.

You will NEVER see a 260 pound shredded bodybuilder with a 30-inch waist, it simply isn’t possible. The reason for this is that when you gain muscle, even though you could be completely shredded, your waist size will still increase as your muscle mass level increases. Yes there are 260-pound top bodybuilders with small looking waists, but if you physically took a tape measure and measured their waist, you would find that they are all much larger than they appear. It is the huge back and shoulders that create a v taper illusion of a tiny little waist. Just for your reference, when I’m at my absolute leanest my waist is about 31 inches or so. The Real Reason Why Blown Out Waists Occur In Bodybuilding Despite what kind of misconceptions circulate in the community, the real reason why blown out waists and guts are so prominent in the pro circuit nowadays is a combination of insulin abuse, overeating, eating a ton of processed foods and/or carbs, and predetermined genetic structure. I could go have a cheat day and binge on pizza and chips and ice cream all day and make my waist and gut look absolutely disgusting, but give me a few days after that to diet on low carbs in a calorie deficit drinking lots of water and I could transform my physique seemingly overnight.

    "content": "The Best Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo     The Best Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo  When it comes to shampoos meant for hair loss prevention, there is one overriding ingredient you have to make sure it has before you even start thinking about buying it. That ingredient is Ketoconazole. All other ingredients in the shampoo are negligible compared to Ketoconazole, as this is the ONLY ingredient in hair loss prevention shampoos that can actually combat DHT directly. In terms of covering your bases in all aspects in your fight against hair loss, there are 3 products that are known as “The Big 3” which will be the only products you really need to concern yourself with. Anything else on the market over the counter that is not in The Big 3 is 99.9% a snake oil product that will do absolutely nothing to prevent DHT from wreaking havoc on your scalp. Ketoconazole shampoo is part of the big 3 (Finasteride and/or RU58841 + Minoxidil + Ketoconazole shampoo). These three products in combination will be your absolute best line of defence against hair loss, and I wouldn’t recommend anything else other than these products at the moment to be honest. They work synergistically to maximize your ability to keep a full thick head of hair. In regards to which hair loss prevention shampoo is the best, I continuously go back to the same Ketoconazole shampoos as I believe there are 2 that are the best bang for your buck. ‘Nizoral' Anti-Dandruff Shampoo Or ‘Intelligent' Super Volumizing Shampoo This shampoo should be applied each time you wash your hair and rubbed into your scalp and then left there for about 10 minutes before washing it out. It is just a normal anti-dandruff shampoo, however, it contains Ketoconazole, which is a powerful antifungal that removes the buildup of DHT in the hair follicles. It works very well and I use it alongside my RU58841. The two best Ketoconazole shampoos in my opinion are Nizoral and Intelligent. The difference between them being that Intelligent has a variety of other ingredients in it that simply make it a higher quality shampoo, and it doesn’t dry your hair out like Nizoral potentially could. However, Nizoral is quite a bit cheaper, so you can alternate between Nizoral and Intelligent to save money. If Nizoral doesn’t dry out your hair, just stick with that as it is cheaper and has the same amount of Ketoconazole in it anyways (the ingredient you want). You can get Nizoral here: Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo  And Intelligent Shampoo here: Intelligent Super Volumizing Shampoo I highly recommend using a Ketoconazole Shampoo if you are concerned about preventing hair loss in any capacity.

    "content": "Top 5 Tips – How To Not Get Nervous On Dates     Top 5 Tips – How To Not Get Nervous On Dates  Talk Slower One thing that is very common on dates is to get flustered when it comes to having a fluid conversation. It can be very intimidating thinking about sitting with an attractive woman you don’t know for an hour or longer and maintaining a calm and chilled out demeanor. When I get nervous, I tend to speak quicker and stumble on my words a bit. One strategy I started implementing that helped tremendously was forcing myself to talk slower. Not only does it eat up a significantly greater amount of time speaking slowly, but it makes you appear more calm and cool, and it also allows you to process your thoughts into coherent sentences FAR better. Try it yourself. Pretend your sitting beside a gorgeous women and say “How was your weekend” super fast. It comes across as panicked, nervous, anxious, uncool, and inexperienced. Now, pretend your sitting beside a gorgeous women and say “How was your weekend” much slower. You will notice that it now sounds much smoother, cooler, calm and collected, and like a guy who has actually been on a date before. This is the way you want to come across on dates. Do not aim to “be cool”, instead, aim to be calm, and then the “being cool” thing will simply fall into place alongside that. Sit Beside Her Instead Of Across From Her This tip helps on a variety of levels. Firstly, sitting across from each other on a date prevents you from being able to touch the girl at all, which will greatly reduce your chances of getting physical. One of the main keys to success on any date is getting physical as early as possible. Whether that be a friendly hug when you first meet her, teasing gestures throughout the date, putting your hand on her thigh, holding her hand, putting your arm around her, squeezing her bicep while you make a joke about working out, whatever it is, you need to do this early and often. Think about it this way, if you go on a date and sit across from a girl for an hour talking about life, and then you walk her to her car after to kiss her goodnight, you haven’t touched her once the entire date and now you have to awkwardly break through this tension that has built up over the entire date. On the other hand, you’ve been physical the whole date, holding her hand, having your arm around her, etc. and now you’re walking her back to her car, and the kiss isn’t just way less awkward, it is now essentially expected, and there is no big feeling of unease between either of you. Basically, if you don’t touch the girl for an entire hour and then try and kiss her goodnight or bring her home with you to have sex, I guarantee it will be far more awkward and have a higher chance of not being successful than if you had been making contact throughout the date. Also, sitting across from a girl with a big table between you just feels impersonal and like you are interviewing her. If you feel weird about sitting beside her right away, I suggest you have a pre-planned strategy in place as an excuse to move to sit beside her. An example of this is I used to have a picture on my phone of something funny that I would typically talk about on dates, and once that topic came up in the date I would say “here I’ll show you something on my phone” and then I’d get up and sit right beside her to show her. From that point on I would stay right beside her and start being more physical with my flirting. Do An Activity For The Date This tip is great for guys who are very inexperienced conversationalists and have a difficult time maintaining a fluid conversation. Honestly, I’m not a huge fan of spending a bunch of money on the first date, as it is absolutely nonsensical to continuously take girls out for fancy dinners on first dates when only a fraction of those will convert into sexual partners, and a far smaller fraction of those will convert into long-term partners. My typical first date is going to a nice bar and getting 1 drink and having a conversation getting to know each other for about an hour, or going for a walk at a place with nice scenery like the beach, sea wall, or a park. These are both super cheap (or free) and will give you the same result as an “activity date” if you can hold a decent conversation and touch early and often. However, “activity dates” despite being more expensive, afford you the opportunity to have more of an excuse to touch, and more of an excuse to not speak without it being awkward. Some examples of great “activity dates” are bowling, playing pool, mini-golf, or anything that doesn’t involve you sitting stationary where you have to rely entirely on your conversation and non-verbal flirting (your game). Bowling for example gives you the opportunity to constantly give high fives, and give other flirty gestures that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to do in a verbal dominated setting like getting a drink at a bar. It also doesn’t require you to rely so heavily on your conversation skills because you will be bowling the entire date, laughing, and having fun together. Phenibut Phenibut is bar none the greatest pro-social supplement ever created in my opinion. For some individuals, Phenibut can literally completely destroy your social inhibitions just like alcohol would, all without the sloppy loss of motor skills and other negative side effects that come from a night of drinking. It’s a pretty remarkable supplement to say the least, and it has been a huge part of my life (especially my dating life) for the past 5 years. I don’t drink or rely on recreational drugs as a crutch at all for anxiety relief as they can impair motor functions and make you very sloppy. Instead, if needed, I use Phenibut, which affects the same GABA receptors that alcohol does which result in a decrease in anxiety and social inhibitions, but without the negative side effects that come along with alcohol. Benefits of Phenibut: – Kills social anxiety as well as general anxiety – Increases social freedom and the desire to socialize – Decreases stress – Can drastically improve your mood – Produces slight to moderate euphoria – Increases sense of well-being – Increases levels of relaxation – Increases levels of focus and motivation – Enhances cognitive function – Music sounds amazing on Phenibut – Very deep levels of sleep (Phenibut can act as a very potent sleep aid at a high enough dose) – No loss of motor function like with alcohol – Improved sexual performance and increased libido (women especially) I have been personally using Phenibut for years now (since late 2012) and it has been a HUGE help in allowing me to bust through social plateaus, build an amazing dating/sex life, kill it in job interviews and nerve wracking business presentations, among countless other benefits. It is a fantastic supplement to use before a date to ease your nerves, chill you out, and get you in the right mindset. I’ve used Phenibut from over 10 different companies now, and the best experience I have had is with Happy Hippo’s Phenibut.  It is pure, has no fillers at all, and most importantly it works consistently batch to batch since the day they opened up shop 4 years ago. Go On More Dates (Exposure Therapy) The number one way to stop being afraid of something is via exposure therapy. A LOT of it. This is arguably the best tip there is, but I promise you if you start going on lots of dates, you will notice that your nerves will drastically go down, and eventually disappear completely. Eventually, you will realize there is nothing to fear, and you will be so used to going on dates that they will no longer be a big deal to you. Stop focusing so much on the outcome of them, and just go on the dates knowing that each date you go on is getting you one step closer to crushing your fears and molding you into a better version of yourself. If you do this a lot, eventually you will notice that you are completely outcome independent because you have so much experience, are not nervous whatsoever, and know that if it doesn’t work out with this girl there are millions of others you can still meet. Once you reach this level of complete outcome independence you will notice that your results start skyrocketing, as it will be reflected in your overall demeanor and the way you come across to women.

    "content": "CRAZY SARMS CYCLE TRANSFORMATION – Before And After Pictures     Impressive SARMs Cycle Transformation The main issue I have with logs, transformations, and progress analysis in general is that typically when someone is reviewing a certain compound, they are also on a myriad of other drugs, thus making their reported results completely skewed by what could have easily been caused by other PED’s they’re also using. Also, typically when a person is bulking (99% of the time), they are fatter at the end of it than they started, which is completely normal (and it would be impossible to accomplish a productive bulk otherwise). However, this puts the user in a position where they can’t accurately establish exactly how many pounds of muscle they’ve put on, because part of their weight gain will inevitably be also comprised of fat and water weight. A researcher in our community was kind enough to let me show you his before and after pictures on Ostarine and S4, both at similar levels of body fat, with the only differing factor being the compounds he was using.  There are no other factors skewing his results, as in the before picture, he isn’t on SARMs, and the after picture he is on Ostarine and S4. He isn’t also on Dbol, Tren, Winny, EQ, and a kitchen sink of other drugs. The results depicted are a 100% accurate representation of what SARMs are capable of.

Obviously diet and training play a massive role in the achievement of this transformation, however, the hormonal environment necessary to build this physique in that span of time, and with that level of muscular detail is provided entirely by SARMs.  To make things even more interesting, in the before picture, he is actually on a steroid cycle that included Winstrol. He was using AAS in 2015, and once he started noticing the negative effect they can have in regards to accelerating hair loss, he made the switch to SARMs and never looked back. Obviously there are products you can use to stave off hair loss when using Steroids like RU58841, but he is very prone to male pattern baldness and wanted to play it safe. Needless to say, it doesn’t look like it has hindered his results one bit.  The transformation was so impressive I felt like an article was warranted, as it is truly a fantastic illustration of what a great diet and training regimen can achieve with SARMs acting as your anabolic.

    "content": "Can You Gain Muscle And Lose Fat At The Same Time?     Can You Gain Muscle And Lose Fat At The Same Time?  The age-old question, can you gain muscle and lose fat at the same time? Typically, no. However, there are some exceptions to the rule, and typically the only time achieving substantial muscle gain while simultaneously burning fat would be a possibility is in one of the following scenarios. 1. You Are A Complete Newbie To Lifting In General The more your physique progresses, the harder and harder it becomes to gain muscle. Essentially, the closer you get to your genetic limit (or past it) your body fights back via various mechanisms and pathways (such as Myostatin) to prevent you from gaining too much muscle tissue. When you are a complete newbie to lifting though, your body will likely experience a phenomenon known as “newbie gains.” Newbie gains occur due to a brand new stimulus being introduced to your muscles, and your body responding very strongly to it due to it essentially shocking your body. I’m sure all of you who have lifted for several years noticed how quickly you made gains during you first year of lifting (consistently), and how over the years those gains have tapered off and maybe even completely plateaued. This is what happens once your body has adapted to a stimulus (resistance training), and is also the exact same reason why when you first shock your central nervous system and muscles with resistance training your body responds so favourably and so quickly to it. During this phase of transitioning from zero resistance training, to consistently hitting the gym each week, your body can undergo a very substantial recomposition phase where you gain a significant amount of muscle tissue and strength so quickly that your body fat percentage actually decreases as the amount of muscle you have gained relative to the amount of fat sitting on your frame is now considerably greater than it was prior to your newbie gains. Through this process, one can successfully gain muscle and lose fat at the same time for the duration of their newbie gains, after which achieving both of these goals simultaneously will prove to be much more difficult, if not completely impossible. 2. You’ve Never Ate A Proper Muscle Building Diet This is like another form of newbie gains, except it comes from a different pathway of growth. Resistance training is what breaks down the muscle, and forces your body to adapt by recuperating your muscles into bigger and stronger ones to adapt to this stimulus. However, the food/nutrients you eat are what is actually responsible for putting your body in an anabolic environment where you can effectively recover from your training. If your diet is subpar, then you will not make optimal gains, period. This is where most individuals fail. You probably see tons of guys at your gym year in and year out, and wonder to yourself why does this guy look the exact same even though he’s there 5 days a week, and seems to lift pretty hard. The reason usually boils down to a poor diet limiting his recovery ability, consequently keeping him stuck at his current level of musculature. Once you start eating enough protein to properly recover (1.5-2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight is ideal in my opinion), eliminating simple sugars except when necessary (post-workout), eating the amount of calories you need to grow and nothing more, etc. it isn’t uncommon to notice a stark increase in your recovery rate, muscle growth, strength progression, and overall improvement in body composition. Nailing your diet is another way you can maximize your chances of being able to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. 3. It’s Your First Steroid/SARM Cycle You’ve probably realized by now that the trend of putting your body in a conducive environment to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time is dependent upon a stimulus being brand new to your body, and the same applies when it comes to performance enhancing drugs (PED’s). When you first introduce a surpaphyisological amount of muscle building hormones to your body, whether that be steroids or SARMs, it is expected that you are going to put on more muscle than you likely will in any future cycle (assuming your diet and training are in check during the first one). Your body reacts to these hormones the most favourably when they are brand new in your system and your body hasn’t adapted to them whatsoever, and this is yet another scenario where you can successfully gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. 4. You Have Taken Time Off From The Gym, Or Time Off From Muscle Building Drugs This scenario is similar to the previous ones, and is a scenario many individuals find themselves in at one point or another. If you have already built a substantial amount of muscle tissue, especially if that amount is past your genetic limit, you will find that you shrink back down relatively quickly once you start taking large amounts of time off from the gym, the drugs, the diet, or all of the above. However, there is a thing called “muscle memory” which I do strongly believe in, where once you put your body back in a muscle building environment conducive to growth, that you can catch back up and recover those past gains with relative ease. In this scenario, it isn’t uncommon to see guys grow significantly, and lose fat at the same time. One individual who was most famous for this was Kevin Levrone, who was well known for growing into his shows. He would spend the majority of his year off of PED’s, and not training hard, but when he jumped back on cycle and stepped on the gas with his training and diet, he would transform in a matter of months and gain back all of his muscle tissue, as well as lose a significant amount of fat at the same time.  This ability to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time was possible not only because of his insane genetics, but because of the cyclical structure his bodybuilding career would have where he would let himself shrink down for a large portion of the year, and then gain it all back in an accelerated period of time. 5. You’re A Genetic Anomaly Even if none of the other scenarios are applicable, there are rare cases where some individuals are just so genetically gifted that they can just look at a pair of dumbbells and start growing (obviously not literally, but it seems that way). Guys like Phil Heath, Kevin Levrone, and other Mr. Olympia competitors are among the genetically elite when it comes to this, and just have an unexplainable propensity to pack on inhuman amounts of muscle tissue with minimal fat gain (and particular situations even lose it). This is the least likely scenario for someone to fall into though. In Conclusion How can you gain muscle and lose fat at the same time? In short, this process is unfortunately unachievable for the vast majority of us. Most individuals will likely end up spinning their wheels trying to accomplish both tasks simultaneously, and it is wise to really ask yourself if attempting a recomposition phase is something that would benefit you the most for your long-term goals. Be Patient This is one of the most important things you must do. Building muscle, and then stripping fat off, and then building muscle, and then stripping fat off, over and over is a very long-term commitment, and results will seem slow to those who are impatient. Even on cycle everyone wants to gain 15-20+ pounds of muscle, but it just doesn’t work like that for most people. Building a great physique is a slow process that takes at least a few years (unless you are a genetic freak), and patience must be taken during this building process. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither will your ideal physique.

    "title": "Top 3 Best Clubbing Fragrances For Men – 2017",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/top-3-best-clubbing-fragrances-2017/",
    "date": "2017-08-20T20:21:23+00:00",
    "content": "Top 3 Best Clubbing Fragrances For Men – 2017      Top 3 Clubbing Fragrances 2017  Honorable Mentions: Dolce & Gabbana The One EDP: http://amzn.to/2moglSN This is in the honourable mentions simply because the scent is fantastic and a bonafide panty dropper.  Its’ performance is by no means a heavy hitter in the club, BUT, if you apply enough of it, when women get close to you they can smell it in the club, and that’s when the compliments roll in with this fragrance. When I used to work as a bouncer, I field-tested the hell out of this fragrance in the club to see how it would hold up, and it did VERY well. However, in order for it to do well I typically had to work my way through three quarters of a 10ml atomizer throughout the night (a span of 6 hours). This fragrance is simply the Eau De Parfum concentration version of the EDT version of The One. We lucked out and they actually nailed the scent and maintained its’ integrity, while doing exactly what we hoped with this one, and that was to simply make it stronger but still smell the same. This sexy fragrance has a very obvious boozy, tobacco note in it that makes it smell very sophisticated, and the overall scent is just incredibly sexy too. If you were to only buy 1 panty-dropper fragrance that would universally please the nose of everyone who smells it, this would probably be the safest buy for you. If you have good skin chemistry for fragrances, this one could be a game changer for you even in the club. Regardless, this is a must have for anyone, even if you don’t use it in the club. Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb: http://amzn.to/2lNUh39 I bought this scent at the beginning of last Fall because I wanted something “spicier” for the Fall and Winter seasons. After I bought this, I noticed an enormous response in compliments.  The performance is great, it isn’t a beast, but it doesn’t require over application to project adequately and it lasts for a very long time. I can still smell this fragrance on my sweaters weeks later. I also find that this fragrance coincides exceptionally with the tastes of women during the Fall and Winter months. During these times Women are going to Starbucks and getting their Pumpkin Spice lattes, buying spiced scented body lotion and soaps, and Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb is literally the epitome of sexy, masculine, Fall/Winter spices. The name of the fragrance is absolutely fitting. It can be a bit weak in the club environment, but it will still work if you have good skin chemistry or apply enough of it. Once women in the club get a whiff of this, I guarantee the compliments roll in. This is one of my number one go-to’s in the fall and winter months. #3 Armani Code Profumo: http://amzn.to/2fECytG This fragrance smells delicious. It has some of the same DNA of the original Armani Code, but definitely has been amped up about 20 notches in the performance category, and smells a lot sweeter.  The most prominent notes are cardamom, lavender, nutmeg, tonka bean, amber and leather. It is a fantastic clubbing fragrance, AKA it can cut through the crowd of other dudes’ fragrances very well and brings HORDES of compliments from women. It is very sexy, sophisticated, and definitely has a few qualities that differentiate it from Armani Code Original in a big way. Armani Code Original almost smells like a fresh out of the shower type fragrance, whereas the Profumo rendition is absolutely not subtle and falls right into the beast category for performance, and best of all, not many guys wear it. You can expect 10+ hours of high performance wear out of a few spritzes of this stuff, it is that strong. In the club this fragrance pulls a lot of attention, and it is definitely worthy of the number 3 spot in this top 3 list. #2 Versace Eros: http://amzn.to/2bBOb0Y This fragrance is an absolute killer in the club.  It smells fresh, woody, and slightly oriental, with the main notes being mint, green apple, tonka bean, ambroxan, vanilla and geranium. It is VERY potent smelling, and it projects extremely well. It cuts through the crowd nicely, it is very sexy, women love it, and it oozes of one night stand alpha male. This was my go-to club fragrance for almost 4 years. #1 Jean Paul Gaultier Ultra Male: http://amzn.to/2wRQ1Sg This fragrance is definitely a killer panty dropper for clubbing and offers more versatility in the fall and winter months in other scenarios.  There are some citrus notes in the opening, with the dry down resulting in some very obvious black vanilla, amber, cedar, and patchouli. This fragrance IS ABSOLUTELY a panty dropper, and I find this one fairly versatile as well as long as you don’t wear it when it’s blistering hot out. This fragrance will have women swooning, guaranteed. The projection and longevity are phenomenal, and the scent is very sweet and masculine. It is a beast in all facets. It almost smells edible to me, kind of like Armani Code Profumo, but this has easily become my favorite clubbing fragrance in the past year. The very sweet opening can be a turn off for some frag-heads, but women go nuts for this fragrance, I promise you that. It is sweet, very sexy, and very fun. When you can combine extremely sexy, fun, and beast performance, you have the perfect storm for a killer panty dropper clubbing fragrance. And that’s exactly what you get from Ultra Male. When it lingers in the air in the club, it cuts through the crowd amazingly and women don’t need to be within 1 inch of you to smell you like most other fragrances. This fragrance is definitely blind buy worthy. Any of these top fragrances will not only have your sex appeal cranked through the roof, but they provide women with an opportunity to strike up a conversation with you that they might not have had otherwise. It isn’t uncommon for women to run over in the club and tell you how great and sexy you smell with any of these on.

    "content": "Top 10 Best Summer Fragrances For Men 2017     Best Colognes for Men for Summer 2017  Honorable Mentions: L'homme – Yves Saint Laurent:  http://amzn.to/2fAwB0S This is the most “pleasant” smelling male fragrance. It is almost unisex smelling it is so pleasant, but it has just enough masculinity to be obviously a men’s fragrance.  It is a softer scent, playful and just makes you happy when you smell it. It has the same effect when women smell it on you, and it is the ultimate fragrance choice for daytime staying at home situations. Basically, any indoor situation where you need something safe that just smells great, this is a very solid choice. It is my go to “close encounters” day time indoor fragrance at all times of the year. The only reason it didn’t make the top 10 is because I’ve realized over the years that the performance of this fragrance is fairly weak. I really have to apply a lot of it to get the longevity and projection I want out of it, and even then it can be underwhelming in the performance category. It smells absolutely amazing though and is a solid fragrance to have in your collection. Abercrombie & Fitch Fierce: http://amzn.to/2vOcvqh If you are a millennial, you probably remember this one from high school, or from the times you used to shop at A&F when you had no idea how to dress yourself.  This fragrance pure musk, but it isn’t a bad choice to have in your summer time arsenal. This fragrance comes off as very youthful, playful, and “young sexy.” I don’t think that older men would be able to wear this scent; it is tailored more towards the teenage/very young adult crowd. I held off from buying this scent for a while, but I ended up pulling the trigger last year and was very pleased with the amount of compliments it has brought in. I find that this scent is best for school and dates. #10 Azzaro Chrome: http://amzn.to/2vO376f  I never bought a 100ml bottle of this because I honestly just have too many aquatics, and they tend to overlap to a significant degree in the summer. You only need to many solid aquatic fragrances in my opinion. This one is definitely one of the best ones out there, and I would have bought it if I didn’t already have 5 other fragrances that greatly overlap with this one. The standout top notes are rosemary, pineapple, neroli, bergamot and lemon; and the base notes are sandalwood, tonka bean, musk, oakmoss, cedar, brazilian rosewood and cardamom. This is definitely a mass pleaser in my opinion, and you’ll be hard-pressed to find a girl who doesn’t at least think it’s decent. This is a very safe compliment getter, and falls right into that summer aquatic category. I feel as though a lot of aquatics tend to be perceived as “young” but I think that most all age groups can wear this one. #9 Nautica Voyage: http://amzn.to/2wROv2q Nautica Voyage is a fantastic VERY cheap summer fragrance.  It is a great everyday scent that can be used for anything essentially, and is universally pleasing to all who smell it. It is very affordable, with 100 ml only costing around $15. I ALWAYS have a bottle of this in my collection, and if I’m running out I will order another one without question. It is a perfect scent for summer time, the gym (it’s very fresh), or the daytime in general. It has mass appeal with women and it is a very, very safe choice. I have yet to encounter one single person who doesn’t like this fragrance a lot. The performance is good, it is versatile as hell, it is insanely cheap, and all women love it. You can’t go wrong with Nautica Voyage. #8 Versace Pour Homme: http://amzn.to/2vrMFaB This scent is fresh and clean. It fits right into the summer category very nicely and is absolutely an aquatic.  It isn’t a panty dropper by any means (no summer fragrances really are in my opinion), but it definitely gets the job done and you will definitely draw a lot of positive attention with this one. This scent is quite versatile and can be used everyday and in almost all situations in the summer. The notable notes are lemon, bergamot, tonka bean, musk and amber. This is another very safe choice for summer. #7 Perry Ellis 360 Red: http://amzn.to/2vrSNjn Another very inexpensive fragrance, 360 Red smells exactly the same as Acqua Di Gio, but it performs much better with greater projection and longevity.  So it not only is much cheaper, but it performs better as well. This scent is super versatile and can be used at work, at school, running errands, on dates, with family, out with friends, it literally is fantastic for almost every single situation. The most noticeable notes from this fragrance are the Lime, Cinnamon and Bergamot, and it is very strong so be careful to not over apply it. This fragrance might be a tad overpowering for close encounter indoor date situations, but for literally anything out of the house it is a must have. With the price, performance, and how good the fragrance simply is, I think 360 Red is an essential for the summer. #6 Versace Man Eau Fraiche: http://amzn.to/2wD6mLj This might be the freshest smelling fragrance on the entire list, and it couldn’t be more fitting for summer.  The most notable notes include lemon, bergamot, rosewood, rose, cedar, amber, musk, and saffron. The opening is very fresh, and it gives off a very clean, sporty, masculine vibe. It’s almost like the ideal way a guy would smell coming out of the shower to a woman is the best way I can describe it. It is not a projection monster, so over applying won’t result in you being insanely cloying, and I think it could be reserved as a go-to freshen up scent for situations like the office, summer social gatherings, summer dates, gym, etc. It won’t be as much of a go-to during the fall and winter months (if at all) but in the summer this one is right there in the mix of the top summer fragrances in my opinion. This fragrance definitely holds its’ own in the aquatic category, and I think it is one of the best summer fragrances by far. If you don’t already have a summer aquatic, this one could easily fill that position and leave you very satisfied. #5 Jean Paul Gaultier Ultra Male (for clubbing): http://amzn.to/2wRQ1Sg This one isn’t a “summer” fragrance per say, but as long as you don’t wear it in the high summer heat, I think this is definitely a killer panty dropper for clubbing and cooler summer nights. You can’t really show up to the club dripping in an aquatic, so I tend to use this for my clubbing fragrance in the summer, and it works fantastically. There are some citrus notes in the opening, with the dry down resulting in some very obvious black vanilla, amber, cedar, and patchouli. This fragrance IS absolutely a panty dropper, which is exactly why I had to include it in this list, because a lot of the heavy hitters in the winter just don’t work as well in the summer, and I find this one fairly versatile as long as you don’t wear it when it’s blistering hot out. This fragrance will have women swooning, guaranteed. The projection and longevity are phenomenal, and the scent is very sweet and masculine. It almost smells edible to me, kind of like Armani Code Profumo, but honestly this has easily become my favorite clubbing fragrance in the past year. The very sweet opening can be a turn off for some frag-heads, but women go nuts for this fragrance, I promise you that. This fragrance is definitely blind buy worthy. #4 Paco Rabanne Invictus Aqua (limited edition): http://amzn.to/2wRHleM This fragrance is a limited edition, meaning it won’t be produced in the foreseeable future, and could become near impossible to find eventually.  This fragrance gives off a very fun vibe, and if you have ever smelled the original Invictus (which in itself garners a lot of compliments), this one is an improved version of that with an aquatic twist in my opinion. This can definitely be cloying if over sprayed due to the sweetness, so don’t overdo it. The longevity and projection are very solid so you don’t need to douse yourself in it anyways. This fragrance could be used for summer parties and clubbing as well, and it seems to fall more into the younger category, not only in who should wear it, but in which range of women respond well to it. It comes off as youthful, fun, sexy, and definitely appeals to a younger demographic of women. It isn’t immature necessarily, but you will notice that typically younger women respond better to this one (at least I did). This is absolutely a compliment monster. Most frag-heads despise Invictus and Invictus Aqua almost as much (or more so) than Sauvage, but if you simply want something that kills it with the ladies, this one will more than suffice in the summer. It is almost like a fusion of the original Invictus with Nautica Voyage. This fragrance performs well in the high summer heat so don’t worry about that, just don’t over spray it like I mentioned already. #3 Creed Aventus and Reyane Tradition Insurrection Pure II: http://amzn.to/2pj58QZ http://amzn.to/2mhyIpL I had to include Creed Aventus because of its’ uniqueness, versatility in the summer, and its’ ability to get compliments in pretty much any scenario.  It provides a very nice alternative to most standard summer fragrance choices as well in that it isn’t aquatic and just fresh smelling. The scent opens with a very apparent pineapple note, and then it dries down into a woody, creamy, and smoky kind of scent. You will occasionally find some women who aren’t as completely enamored with this scent as you would expect from Aventus, so it isn’t necessarily the safest bet always, but I promise you, there are A LOT of women who do have a great appreciation for this fragrance DNA, and it excels in the summer. While any age group can wear this fragrance, I almost feel that it is more of a mature scent, and typically the younger girls who drop their panties for things like Invictus Aqua will not like this scent. However, more mature women definitely go nuts for this fragrance, and I think if you are in your late twenties or above, this is a must have to get at some point. If you are strapped for funds and can’t afford Aventus, then by all means do not get it. It is one of the most outrageously expensive fragrances out there, but many guys feel it is worth every penny. If you really want Aventus but simply can’t afford it, I compel you to try out Reyane Tradition Insurrection Pure II. Insurrection Pure II is essentially just an Aventus clone, smelling nearly 100% identical, for a minuscule fraction of the retail price. Only a fragrance expert would be able to tell the difference if you blindfolded them to be honest. Aventus does outperform Insurrection Pure II in terms of longevity and projection, but honestly for such a cheap price, you can just reapply Insurrection much more and carry a travel atomizer around with you. This fragrance only retails for around $25-30, meanwhile Aventus is commonly sold for upwards of $300 per bottle. Whether you can afford Aventus, or you can only afford Insurrection Pure II, I think it’s a no brainer to have one or the other in your arsenal. #2 Versace Dylan Blue: http://amzn.to/2vvyCzi  This fragrance is almost like a woody aquatic, and you will know what I mean when you smell it. There are polarizing aquatics like Nautica Voyage (which you should have at least one of for summer in my opinion), while this one is distinctively woody. The main notes are Bergamot, Ambroxan, and Patchouli. The performance of this is a fair bit better than the other Versace fragrances on this list, and for a semi-fresh fragrance, its’ projection and longevity is pretty good. I would typically get 7-8 hours of good wear out of this, which is very solid considering my very dry skin. This one is definitely a compliment getter and you would be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn’t like this fragrance. This fragrance isn’t a panty dropper, but like I mentioned earlier, it is very uncommon to have a fresh fragrance that a girl falls in love with at the first whiff. Instead, what you can expect are LOTS of consistent compliments, but not as often that “oh my god” reaction that you would get with something like D&G The One (not a traditional summer fragrance, but it could be used for dates still for sure in the summer). #1 Dior Sauvage: http://amzn.to/2bICLpl The fragrance the community loves to hate.  Dior Sauvage is the number one summer fragrance simply because women haven’t explicitly given me more compliments for anything else so far (for summer fragrances). It is very fresh and clean smelling, but many guys will claim it smells extremely synthetic (including myself). It is not aquatic whatsoever, it is simply fresh. I’m not going to say this is my personal favorite for the title of “the best summer fragrance,” because I do like a few other fragrances on this list more myself, but it definitely deserves its’ placement in regards to womens’ reactions to it. It is a beast in the performance and longevity category, and it picks up tons of attention as it lingers in the air. When you are out and about in the summer heat, you will get TONS of compliments from women with it. This one is definitely blind buy worthy because even if you go to the store to smell it first, you will probably not like it very much. Women think it’s incredibly sexy, it pulls in a stupid amount of compliments, it is perfect for the summer, and it is super safe. You can’t get much better than that, especially if you are a guy who just wants to get a one size fits all kind of scent that will absolutely kill it in almost all situations.

    "content": "How To Know If Your T3 Is Real     How To Know If Your T3 Is Real A lot of guys seem to have no idea what they're supposed to “feel” on T3, and the truth is, if you aren't very in tune with your body it can be near impossible to tell if your T3 is legit. I know my body fairly well and can tell when T3 is working or not, but I thought I'd get blood work done to show you guys what it looks like when your T3 is 100% legit. I also had bloods done several months back on another batch of this T3 brand and had the exact same results. First, let's take a look at the blood work I had done on 50 mcg of T3 back in March 2017. March 28, 2017 Bloodwork Results One thing that should be noted is that here in Canada, they will only test your TSH and T4 levels unless more extensive testing is needed. In other words, you will never get your T3 levels unless you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism typically as most doctors are stuck in their ignorant ways of just looking at TSH. Luckily for us, all we need in order to know if our T3 is legit is our TSH and T4 levels. You'll notice here that the reference range for TSH is 0.32-5.04 mU/L, and my levels were far under the reference range (where they should be), landing at 0.07 mU/L. The reference range for T4 is 10.6-19.7 pmol/L, and my levels were far below the reference range, landing at less than 5.1 pmol/L (they don't even measure it when it's below this point as it is basically just considered tanked). How To Interpret Thyroid Function Blood Work The pituitary gland controls the thyroid gland, which is a small gland at the base of the brain. When the level of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) drop to levels that are too low, the pituitary gland produces Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) which stimulates the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones. The thyroid gland then produces T4 and T3. The thyroid produces T4 in significantly greater quantities than T3, and T4 is essentially just inactive thyroid hormone. T4 then converts to T3 which is the active thyroid hormone, which plays a direct and majorly influential role on your body's metabolism and nutrient partitioning. Basically, the value we care about having a good amount of is T3, as having sky high T4 means nothing if it is not converting to T3, but that's another article topic entirely. In regards to this blood work and verifying a T3 product's potency, by looking at my bloodwork you can see that my TSH and T4 levels are tanked. The reason for this is that my T3 levels are sky high from exogenously administering T3, so we can conclude via my bloodwork that the T3 is indeed very potent, as 50mcg has completely crushed my TSH and T4. Now, many guys are probably thinking, well isn't having no T4 bad because then you won't have any T3 being converted? How the thyroid works is that when exogenous T3 is administered, the body recognizes there is an adequate amount (or supraphysiological amount in this case) of active thyroid hormone circulating in the blood, therefore there is no need to produce any more thyroid hormones. As a response, the body stops producing TSH, which means there is no T4 or T3 production being stimulated, and your thyroid gland essentially goes to sleep for the duration of time you are on exogenous T3. So, as you can see via my blood work, my body has recognized an exogenous source of T3, and has halted the production TSH, and consequently T4 entirely. We can definitively conclude that my TSH and T4 levls are shut down due to a supraphysiological amount of T3 being in my system. Upon cessation of T3 use, your body will recognize that there is now an absence of thyroid hormones in your body, and then TSH will spike back up to stimulate your natural endogenous T4 and T3 production. There have been studies done where users of T3 stopped cold turkey and their thryoid levels returned to baseline very quickly. This is because the thyroid basically just goes to sleep whenever you are using exogenous thyroid hormones, and if you had a naturally healthy/properly functioning thyroid to begin with, it should fully recover fairly quickly upon discontinuing your use of exogenous thyroid hormones.  This was the bloodwork results I had recently on a different batch of the same brand's T3. As you can see, I had the exact same result essentially, with TSH and T4 in the gutter, so we can conclude that this batch of T3 is also very potent as well.

    "title": "Will Taking Deca With Finasteride Cause Hair Loss?",
    "url": "https://moreplatesmoredates.com/will-taking-deca-with-finasteride-cause-hair-loss/",
    "date": "2017-07-12T20:38:58+00:00",
    "content": "Will Taking Deca With Finasteride Cause Hair Loss?     Whether or not combining NPP or Deca with Finasteride will accelerate hair loss is something often asked about in our community. Typically Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca-Durabolin) and Nandrolone Phenylpropionate (NPP) are very hair safe compounds (they are the same hormone with different esters). For those wanting to minimize hair loss on steroids, incorporating Nandrolone as the foundation of each cycle is a popular strategy. Why Nandrolone Is Less Likely To Cause Hair Loss Than Other Steroids The reason why Nandrolone is fairly hair safe is its relative lack of androgenicity in the body. Relative to the base hormones we use as a reference point for hair loss (Testosterone and DHT), Nandrolone is a superior option. However, this is not because Nandrolone is less androgenic than DHT and Testosterone. In fact, Nandrolone is more androgenic than Testosterone, albeit less androgenic than DHT. The low androgenic activity is solely due to the interaction of Nandrolone with 5α-reductase. 5α-Reductase is the enzyme mainly responsible for the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body. Testosterone is partially converted via 5α-reductase to the more androgenic metabolite DHT. This same enzymatic process also partially converts Nandrolone into a metabolite known as dihydronandrolone (DHN).  Androgenicity Of Testosterone & DHT Vs. Nandrolone & DHN DHN is the least androgenic of the four hormones. If we were to list these four hormones in order of most to least androgenic, it would look like this:  Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) – Most androgenic Nandrolone Testosterone Dihydronandrolone (DHN) – Least androgenic  Combining Nandrolone With Finasteride Or Dutasteride Will Accelerate Hair Loss Because 5α-reductase is so dense in the scalp, we actually end up making Nandrolone more hair safe via our own natural endogenous enzymatic processes. However, this is also why inhibiting this enzymatic process with 5α-reductase inhibitors can become problematic for steroid users. Those utilizing NPP or Deca with Finasteride or Dutasteride are actually inhibiting this enzymatic process at 5α-reductase whereby Nandrolone would normally be converted into the far more hair safe metabolite DHN. Thus, when combining Nandrolone with Finasteride or Dutasteride, the opposite effect occurs than with Testosterone [R].  As you can see in the graph above, using a 5α-reductase inhibitor partially inhibited the conversion of Testosterone to DHT. This is why ventral prostate stimulation (a proxy for androgenic activity and hair loss) decreased so significantly in the 5α-reductase inhibitor treated group. In the Nandrolone treated groups, using a 5α-reductase inhibitor partially inhibited the conversion of Nandrolone to DHN. Because Nandrolone is much more androgenic than DHN, inhibiting this enzymatic process maintained higher serum concentrations of Nandrolone in 5α-reductase dense tissues and ventral prostate stimulation (a proxy for androgenic activity and hair loss) spiked significantly. What Steroids Will Finasteride Protect You From? Most of the steroids used for bodybuilding and powerlifting are not potent substrates for 5α-reductase, or are not substrates for 5α-reductase at all. That means that Finasteride and Dutasteride will absolutely not help prevent hair loss on steroids like Dianabol, Trenbolone, Anadrol, Winstrol, Masteron, Equipoise, MENT (Trestolone), Proviron, Primobolan, DHB, and the list goes on. It will also not help prevent hair loss on androgenic SARMs like S23. At the end of the day, the only steroid worth mentioning that Finasteride or Dutasteride really help attenuate the progression of androgenic alopecia on is Testosterone. And even with DHT substantially inhibited with Finasteride, or nearly wiped out entirely with Dutasteride, Testosterone still has its own inherent androgenicity and will miniaturize hair follicles too, just to a far lesser and slower extent. This is why some individuals on Dutasteride with aggressive androgenic alopecia still lose hair even with zero DHT in their body. How To Protect Yourself From Hair Loss On Deca Or NPP The easiest way to do this is with a potent topical anti-androgen like RU58841. Back in 2016 I was trying to find a log of someone who had used RU58841 concurrently with Deca or NPP to see if the same catastrophic Finasteride reaction would occur if I were to combine RU58841 with Nandrolone. I scoured the Internet and could not find 1 single log of someone having tried them both at the same time. I took it upon myself to guinea pig it, as NPP was my favourite bulking compound at the time. If you have read my RU58841 article, you will know that I was in a state of severe diffuse thinning prior to starting RU58841. At this state of diffuse thinning, I was also already about 1/3 of my way into a cycle of Testosterone and NPP. I started with 50mg of RU58841 applied once per day, and within a week I already noticed that my shedding had dramatically decreased. I went from losing 50-100+ hairs in the shower drain each shower to literally 1-5 hairs per shower. Over the next couple months, I noticed significant density/thickness returning to my hair as I was now losing hair at a rate far slower than the rate at which I was growing it. Within a couple months while still on my NPP cycle, I had regained a significant amount of ground I had lost from my previous cycles, and my hair looked as good as it did a couple years prior. Obviously this experiment was super risky, as I could’ve ended up screwing myself far worse if RU58841 just so happened to have the same reaction with Nandrolone that Finasteride/Dutasteride has, but I lucked out, and uncovered a fantastic hair loss preventative measure for bodybuilders. Reflecting on it now, I laugh to myself because I was so oblivious to the mechanism of action of these hormones that I failed to realize that topical anti-androgens facilitate their effects by binding to Androgen Receptors, and they have zero impact on 5α-reductase. That means that there was no possible way Nandrolone converting into DHN would be inhibited, regardless of how much RU58841 I was applying. All it does in layman's terms is compete with DHN in the scalp for androgen receptor binding. Fortunately, RU58841 has a binding affinity equivalent to or greater than that of Testosterone, therefore it is actually quite effective at staving off androgenic activity that could be facilitated by DHN and residual amounts of Nandrolone in the scalp In Conclusion Never combine NPP or Deca with Finasteride or Dutasteride if you care about your hair. If you want to use a more efficacious treatment to stave off androgenic alopecia on a Nandrolone cycle, a topical anti-androgen of formidable binding affinity like RU58841 would be worth considering.

    "content": "How To Stay Shredded Year Round While Enjoying Good Food And Drinks     How To Stay Shredded Year Round While Enjoying Good Food And Drinks This article will directly address how to make being in shape/very lean a sustainable lifestyle, as opposed to something that is completely draining and can only be maintained for a short period of time.  Typically, when most individuals diet down successfully and get shredded, they will do their competition or photo shoot or whatever they were preparing for, and then have an entire week binge fest where they eat everything in sight. Within a few weeks, their several months of excruciating work has completely gone down the tubes and they are back to a bloated, soft, undefined physique. When you deprive your body for long periods of time, your cravings grow in intensity. Getting very shredded eventually will bring you to a point where you just can’t mentally or physically (or both) handle continuing to diet, train, and do your cardio to the extreme you would need to in order to get shredded, and stay shredded. I have been guilty of this in the past too, and have made the mistake of increasing my calories all the way back up to maintenance after my cut, only to be shocked (in a negative way) when my body sucked in everything like a sponge and within a few weeks I was up 25+ pounds from my competition weight, and my abs were barely visible anymore. So How Can You Stay Shredded Year Round And Maintain It Without Going Insane/Wanting To Kill Yourself? Ok, so I’ve tinkered with A LOT of diet styles over the years, and the number one cause of failure in individuals with respect to being shredded is their inability to stick to a strict caloric intake. Especially once the calories get very low when you are reaching sub 8-9% body fat levels. Obviously this will differ for all individuals, but a solid diet style that will allow you to stay in amazing condition year round without wanting to eat 47 pizzas at any given moment and feeling like you are being tortured on a daily basis just to maintain your body is intermittent fasting/appetite control, as well as carbohydrate timing (if you are going to have carbs in your diet). Intermittent Fasting/Appetite Control So, delving into intermittent fasting (IF), it is basically a form of dieting where you don’t eat for an extended period of the day (hence “fasting”) and then you have a set window of time later in the day to eat your allotted calories for the day. So, why is it so great for staying shredded? I’ll tell you why. First off, when you wake up you are probably not starving to begin with. I don’t know about you guys, but the one time of the day I’m definitively not hungry is right when my eyes open. I could go to bed hungry, and wake up not hungry. Odd, but that’s how my body works, and that’s how it does for many others as well. So, basically the main premise behind pushing your eating window back as far into the day as possible is to completely offset that feeling you will inevitably get on a low calorie diet where you are craving food like a madman. When you wake up, if you eat a meal with carbs in it (especially high glycemic ones), you will spike your insulin levels. When this happens, you just took the first step in making your diet for the day 10x more difficult to stick to. Insulin spikes make you very hungry, and they will cause you to store fat much more easily for the active time it is spiked in your blood stream. So, we must take active measures to keep your appetite curbed for as long a period as possible. When you wake up, the first thing you should do is get big glass of sparkling water. You can also take your fat-burner at this time if you are going to take one. The sparkling water will not only fill up your stomach and trick your brain into feeling satiated, but the carbonation will amplify the effect in your stomach and make you feel even less hungry than you normally would be. Your fat-burner should curb your appetite even more so if you are using a good one. After your cardio, you would probably be starving normally, but with all this carbonated water and the supplement doing their job, you will notice that you hardly even feel the need to eat. Ride this feeling and continue with your day as scheduled and forget about food. If you start to feel hunger creeping up and you want to prolong the fast even longer, now would be a fantastic time to go make yourself a coffee. A zero calorie one of course. If you do this, make it black (no added sugar or BS calorie additives). I'm A Fan Of Death Wish Coffee Lately  You can add Stevia for flavour. Stevia is a natural sweetener that tastes like sugar but is 0 calorie and induces no glycemic response in the blood, thus not influencing your fast or your insulin levels. Continue your day, and then before you know it you will notice that you have gone through 2/3 of your day without even feeling the need to eat. This is a lot easier to do if you keep yourself busy and just focus on your work, as you won’t be sitting sedentary in one spot day dreaming about food. Now, because you have plowed through the majority of your day without eating anything, you have a far greater window of flexibility with your allotted calorie total for the day, as you won’t have to split your meals into several tiny ones now. You can have 2 big meals and completely feel stuffed, but while staying well within your calorie goals because you simply were able to control your appetite. The real benefit of this comes into play when you utilize this fasting window to allow you to go out for dinners, have a few drinks, or just eat foods that fall outside the common scope of “diet foods”, and just enjoy your life in general. You know how many times I’ve had to refuse good food in the past. What kind of lifestyle is one where every time you’re out with friends you have to say no to even a single slice of pizza because it will completely shatter your calorie allotment for the day? This method I outlined above will get you so deep into your day without the need for food at all, that you can strategically utilize it to give yourself a giant window of flexibility where you can now actually fit a bit of junk food here and there into your diet without wrecking your progress. Stay Shredded Year Round Without Shooting Yourself While Intermittent Fasting certainly isn’t an optimal way to build size, it is ABSOLUTELY a great way to get and maintain a shredded physique with relative ease. I honestly think it’s the only way you can stay in a calorie deficit and be a very lean body fat % for long periods of time without feeling like you are going to crash and eventually have a giant binge that turns you into a fat slob within weeks. With this method, you can actually enjoy a cheat meal when you get really bad cravings, as it will actually fit within the realm of your calorie allotment if you planned your day well. I hope you guys liked this article and find it helpful for living a more flexible and enjoyable lifestyle, while still staying in fantastic shape.

    "content": "Cardio 101 – The Best Way To Do Cardio To Get Shredded     Cardio 101 – The Best Way To Do Cardio To Get Shredded  Cardio is something that is commonly overlooked by fitness enthusiasts and those who are looking to get in shape. The common misbelief is that if you train your ass off and lift heavy, eventually you will somehow just end up with a physique that is not only big, but ripped as well. This is almost never the case though, because 99% of people don’t understand how fat loss really works. Being in a calorie deficit is the name of the game when it comes to fat loss, and no matter how hard you train or how heavy you lift, if you are overeating, you won’t lose fat. Cardio is a tool that should not only be used for cardiovascular health, but also for greatly improving your body’s ability to burn fat. When you perform cardio, your body burns more calories. When you burn more calories, you are increasing your overall energy expenditure for the day. And when you do this, it ultimately helps you achieve a calorie deficit with much greater ease. So, what’s the best way to do cardio to get shredded? Well, first of all you need to understand that your body is very smart, and it will continuously adapt until it is comfortable. So, you have to approach your cardio plan being mindful that in a few weeks, your body will likely have adapted to your plan to such a degree that it will no longer burn fat following the same plan. When your body is in a calorie deficit, it will burn fat to accommodate the deficit of energy it is experiencing, however, it will also start to slow down your metabolism on purpose. Your body does this to prevent itself from starving. Essentially, you are depriving it of an adequate amount of energy on purpose (to get leaner), but your body just sees it as you are starving, so it will slow down your metabolism until eventually your new “maintenance level” of calories is the amount that was previously a deficit for you. This is why you can’t just go gung-ho with cardio for an hour a day, every single day at the start of your diet, or else your body will adapt to that level of cardio and eventually plateau where you will be stuck with a slow metabolism that can’t even lose fat with 7 hours of cardio per week. So, you need to take a staggered method to your cardio schedule, just like you would when you decrease your caloric intake to continue to burn fat. Start off with 2-3 cardio sessions per week, doing 20 minutes of low-intensity steady state cardio where your heart rate is constantly in the 140-150 beats per minute range throughout the entire session. This can be done on the elliptical, treadmill, stair master, playing a sport, running outside, whatever, as long as you do it properly. After each week, you can assess your fat loss, and if you aren’t losing weight quick enough, or it is too quick, make adjustments to your cardio regimen or caloric intake accordingly. If you plateau in fat loss, then you know it’s time to make a change, and this is when you would either add another cardio session to your weekly regimen, or you would increase the duration of your current sessions by 5 minutes. Through this continuous slow progression of plateau busting, you can eventually get to a point where you are as lean as you want to be, without burning out too early in the program and wrecking your metabolism by doing too much too soon. What about fasted cardio vs. non-fasted cardio? There is science to support that fasted cardio burns more fat than non-fasted, and there is also science to support that it burns the exact same amount of fat. I am definitely a big believer that fasted does work better than non-fasted. I don’t have a bunch of studies to back me up, but I’ve gotten shredded enough times now to know how my body responds to just about everything, and fasted cardio always rips me up quicker. However, it is ultimately of far greater importance that you actually do your cardio, as opposed to worrying about if you can fit it into your schedule in a fasted state or not. If you can, then great, do it. If you can’t, no big deal, just do it post-workout instead. TIP: Never do your cardio pre-workout. Cardio will burn your glycogen stores, and if you do it pre-workout, you are basically using up fuel that you would need to lift weights. If you can’t do your cardio fasted, do your weight training session for the day, deplete your glycogen stores via that, and then hit your cardio session post-workout. This will allow your workout to still be 100% and not hinder your strength during the workout. Getting Shredded Isn’t Rocket Science I guarantee if you follow a proper fat loss diet and cardio regimen you will be shocked at how quickly you can get yourself in fantastic shape. The main issue stems from individuals simply not having the will power to stick to a consistent plan. Set a goal, engrave it in your mind like concrete, and get it done.

    "date": "2017-06-10T11:47:44+00:00",
    "content": "How To Know If You Should Bulk Or Cut?     How To Know If You Should Bulk Or Cut?  I’m going to break this down for you into some simple easy to follow rules:  Bulking when you are already too fat will decrease your insulin sensitivity, which will in turn negatively affect muscle growth The fatter you are, the more prone your body is to packing on and holding even more fat when you gain more weight Bulking up too much will lead to ectopic fat storage, which is essentially when you have consumed so many excess calories that your body isn’t just storing fat as adipose tissue, but it is also storing fat in your muscles. This leads to smoother looking muscles and can wreck your look. Gaining fat in excessive amounts and then having to lose it all afterwards can lead to metabolic damage and stubborn fat storage If you are gaining more muscle than fat pound for pound as the scale goes up, you are likely too fat already and continuing once you get to this point is a recipe for disaster  The Old School Mentality: When I was growing up in my teens, I was basically led down the school of thought that encouraged excessive eating. I was convinced that because I was 140 pounds and a bone rack that I was a “hard-gainer,” when the reality was, I was just under eating and not lifting weights. Adopting the old school mentality for getting huge fast, I ate like my life depended on it. I didn’t just eat, I literally treated each and every day like it was an eating contest where the more food I could consume without puking would equate to more muscle growth. I started growing fast, and I thought to myself “damn if I can keep up this rate I’ll be 300 in no time.” Fast-forward 4 months and I’m 190 pounds. I had gained probably 10-20 pounds of muscle. But guess what, I had gained about 30 pounds of water and fat! My face looked like sh*t, and I had a bit of a gut even. Yes, a bone rack “hard-gainer” went from skin and bones to having a gut in 4 months from bulking too hard. So, I was forced to undertake an aggressive cut, and strip off about 30 pounds to get back down to a level where I could actually start growing properly again. Talk about spinning your wheels. I didn’t realize how terrible my strategy was at the time. Most guys think the heavier they are the better, and they get this tunnel vision on their scale weight, completely disregarding what they actually look like in the mirror. I literally had people telling me I looked like sh*t, but I didn’t care because I thought I was huge. They were right, I was wrong. Basically, once you hit a certain body fat percentage (around 15%) your body starts to become environmentally no longer conducive to productive muscle building. When I say that I mean that when you bulk up and your body fat level increases, your insulin sensitivity will decrease. Insulin is what is responsible for shuttling nutrients to the muscle for recovery, and it has a direct and major impact on how both your muscle and fat cells utilize amino acids and glucose. When your insulin sensitivity is high, muscle cells will readily absorb glucose and amino acids when insulin signals them to open. However, when you have a high level of body fat accrued on your physique, your natural levels of insulin are so much higher that it can have a severe desensitizing effect on muscle cells to insulin’s nutrient shuttling effects. Compounding the issue, with diminished insulin sensitivity your body will become more and more prone to convert more of the excess calories you intake as body fat, as the muscle cells are no longer absorbing and utilizing the consumed glucose and amino acids efficiently. In addition, once you get past a certain body fat percentage, you're simply accelerating fat storage process. It gets worse and worse the fatter you are too. Not only is this unhealthy (I don’t think I need to elaborate on how being fat can lead to cardiovascular issues), it can lead to the creation of new fat cells that make it even harder to diet down once bulking ends. When you are doing a “dirty bulk” at first all the excess calories, which are converted to glucose get used by the muscle and fat cells for energy usage and storage. This is why your pumps and muscular fullness is so great the first couple weeks of hardcore bulking (if you do it this way still). When your glucose levels are constantly high though, you will start to overspill once your glycogen stores are full (which doesn’t take a lot to do). This over spilling process is essentially calories that you don’t need being stored as fat. Your muscles only need a certain amount of glucose to recover, and when you exceed that amount necessary for muscular recovery and growth, you have entered into the dangerous territory of all excess calories being converted right into stored body fat. In addition, if you are already too fat and bulk up further than that, you are just making the process you need to complete to diet down more torturous. If you let yourself get really fat, you are just going to have to kill yourself to diet down. And if you have to do a hardcore cutting diet with an insane amount of cardio and a severe deficit of calories, you will just damage your metabolism by slowing it down far more than it should, and make yourself insanely prone to fat storage for once you want to try bulking back up again, or even eating at maintenance levels of calories. So How Do You Know For Sure If You’re Too Fat To Bulk, Or To Continue Bulking? The decision if you should bulk or cut comes down to knowing your body, using the mirror as a reference point, and assessing your overall results. You need a calorie surplus to build muscle, there is no doubt about that, and gaining weight with a complete absence of some extra body fat is impossible. The key is to minimize this, and once you get to a point where you’re too fat, you can diet down again in a quick and very easy way as you won’t let yourself get to a point where your metabolism is sluggish and your body fat is out of control. Think of it this way, if you are bulking and for every 5 pounds you gain, only 1 of them is muscle, does it make logical sense to continue bulking? You will probably just lose that muscle when you have to diet down to get rid of that 4 pounds of fluff. I suggest never letting yourself bulk up past 14-15% body fat. It’s ok to not have razor sharp abs all year, that would be unrealistic. But if you notice that your abs have literally almost disappeared entirely, you are probably passing the 15% barrier and need to do a mini-cut back down into the single digit body fat % level. Once you start getting too fat and losing insulin sensitivity you will not only start looking really soft with a lot less definition, but you will notice your pumps in the gym aren’t nearly as good as they used to be. Not being able to get a good pump in a calorie surplus is a surefire way to tell that either your diet sucks, or your body isn’t efficiently using the nutrients you are consuming any more and your insulin sensitivity is starting to go down the toilet. Bulk up to 14-15% (max), mini diet back into the single digits, rinse and repeat. This will not only keep your results maximized, but it will allow you to actually look good year round. Take it from me, I’ve done both approaches more times than I can count, and staying lean IS the way to go.

    "content": "Are The Gains From A Steroid Cycle Maintainable?     Are The Gains From A Steroid Cycle Maintainable? This is a common question I get, and I am going to tell you exactly what will determine how much of your cycle gains you can keep from Steroids. So, Can You Keep All Your Gains? Yes, you can. But, this comes with a few conditions. 1) Are You Past Your Genetic Potential? Your body has a certain genetic limit, and this limit represents how much potential your physique has progression wise as a natural. If you train naturally for years and years, with perfect diet and training, you can eventually get very close to this limit, but you will NEVER pass that limit without some supraphysiological anabolic assistance. While the ideal scenario would be to train naturally until you reach your genetic limit, and then to use performance enhancing drugs (PED’s) once you reach this limit should you decide you want to break the barriers of what is physically possible for you as a natural athlete, I’d estimate that less than 1% of PED users actually do this. Usually, this is the result of impatience, as truly reaching your genetic limit can take many years. Regardless if you choose to use them only once you’ve peaked naturally, or you choose to use them earlier, the fact remains that your predetermined genetic potential will serve as a benchmark where no matter what you do, even if you surpass that limit with PED use, eventually, after discontinuing their use, you will slowly return to your genetic potential benchmark (at most). So, hypothetically let’s say you haven’t reached your genetic potential and you aren’t even close to reaching it and you do a cycle of Steroids. Let’s say you gain 10 pounds of muscle off this cycle, and your genetic limit is another 10 pounds more lean muscle above and beyond what you achieved with this cycle. You should have no problems retaining ALL of the gains from that cycle if you PCT properly and continue to diet and train hard. Now, let’s take another hypothetical scenario, let’s just say you are literally peaked as a natural and can’t progress anymore without PED’s and you do a Steroid cycle and gain 10 pounds of muscle. Now you are 10 pounds over your genetic limit. If you PCT perfectly and recover your natural endocrine function and continue to diet and train perfectly, you will likely retain most of your gains, however, this will be temporary. Eventually, your body’s natural supply of hormones simply won’t be satisfactory enough to sustain a level of lean muscle above and beyond of what your genetics are capable of, and over the course of several months (this time frame will differ for each individual), you will slowly lose all 10 of those pounds. Now, some of you may be thinking at this point, then what’s the point of doing a cycle at all. Well, the first thing you need to realize about bodybuilding and PED use is that EVERYTHING is temporary. Look at the pro bodybuilders that are retired. Is Arnold the same size as he was in the 1970’s?                View this post on Instagram                      Let's terminate hate. 100% of the proceeds from this shirt will go to the @simonwiesenthalcenter to fight hate and spread tolerance. Link in my bio! A post shared by  Arnold Schwarzenegger (@schwarzenegger) on Aug 17, 2017 at 5:08pm PDT   \n\n Of course not. This is largely due to his age, but also it has to do with the fact that he doesn’t take supraphysiological amounts of drugs like he used to or train and diet the same way he did before. Look at Ronnie Coleman who is a better example, he was once the greatest bodybuilder on the planet, but now he is hardly recognizable compared to what he once looked like. https://www.instagram.com/p/BeVoSFTj2gP/?hl=en&taken-by=ronniecoleman8 Yet, you have a guy like Dexter Jackson who is almost 50 years old himself (only 5 years younger than Ronnie Coleman), and he still looks as good as he did in his 20's and 30's. As a matter of fact, his physique is arguably even better now at 47 than it was in his 30's which is usually the prime for most bodybuilders, and he still wins top tier shows against guys over 10 years younger than him.                View this post on Instagram                      TRANSFORMATION TUESDAY‼️ OCT. 2002 ➡️SEPT. 2016 ? 15 years apart!! #dexter #dexterjackson #dex #mro #mrolympia #mrolympia08 #built #blade #builtbyblade A post shared by  Dexter \"The Blade\" Jackson (@mrolympia08) on Nov 7, 2017 at 1:57pm PST   \n\n This is because Dexter Jackson has stayed consistent for all of those years and has ALWAYS been consistent with his supraphysiological PED use. And the deterioration of other bodybuilder's physiques like Ronnie occurred because no matter how much muscle you build, once you get off the PED’s, your body is relying on only the amount of hormones that it has to work with, and that amount of hormones simply isn’t enough to sustain a level of muscle mass above and beyond one’s genetic potential. So, if you want to maintain a supraphyisological-sized physique, you are going to need to provide your body a steady (or intermittent via cycling) supply of exogenous hormones that allow it to maintain a greater amount of muscle than it is naturally capable of. So, short answer, yes the gains from Steroids are 100% maintainable, it just depends if you are below or above your genetic potential or not, as well as if you are willing to continue doing more cycles (or just never come off) to maintain/build on that supraphysiological physique if you have surpassed your genetic limit. 2) Are You Still Training Just As Hard And Dieting Properly After Your Cycle? If you train hard and eat properly on cycle and get fantastic gains, it doesn’t mean that you can let off the gas simply because you are now “off cycle.” One of the main factors that will dictate how much muscle you retain from your Steroid cycle will be if you continue to train hard and eat well even once you come off cycle. For some reason, many individuals think that because they have no anabolic assistance that they might as well throw their diet out the window and start taking it easy with their training. This couldn’t be further from the truth, and doing this will just cause the hard earned muscle you just built to melt off your body. You need to continue to train as hard and eat as well as you were on cycle, even when you are off cycle if you want to retain all of your gains from that cycle. You are already going to be fighting an uphill battle with a suppressed endocrine system that is recovering, so your training and diet needs to be 100% on point. 3) Did You PCT Properly? It is shocking how many individuals will embark on a cycle without having their PCT on hand ahead of time, or not even knowing what PCT is in the first place. If you don’t take your post-cycle therapy compounds after you get off whatever PED’s you’re using (if they are suppressive), your body will be in a suppressed state for a far longer span of time, and this is EXTREMELY catabolic. The longer your body remains in a state of suppression without any anabolic assistance, the greater your odds are for experiencing muscle loss. It isn’t uncommon for some individuals to lose everything they gained from a cycle simply because they didn’t PCT at all. The most critical hormone in your body that will retain your muscle mass after you come off a cycle is your endogenous testosterone production. When you come off a cycle, those levels are suppressed, and the point of a proper PCT is to expedite the recovery process of that endogenous testosterone production as quickly as possible. Leaving your body to recover on its’ own with no PCT at all will almost undoubtedly result in a big loss in muscle mass that could’ve easily been retained had you done a proper PCT regimen.

    "content": "How To Increase Your Appetite – Top 8 Ways To Make Yourself Hungry     Eat Smaller Meals Several Times Per Day The first thing I would recommend if you are trying to figure out how to increase your appetite is split your macronutrient intake into 5-6 meals per day. Whether it’s a mental thing or not, I have absolutely noticed that it’s much easier to eat an overall greater amount of food during the day if I break my meals up into several smaller ones. Instead of having 2-3 giant meals, I try to have 5-6 smaller meals while bulking. Splitting the meals up has me feeling much less bogged down and sluggish, and I get hungrier again a lot quicker. Do Cardio Yes, do cardio even while you're bulking. Cardio may seem counterproductive while bulking, but on the contrary, it is one of the best ways to stimulate a lacking appetite. Keeping some form of cardio in your regimen while bulking at least a few times per week is not only essential for cardiovascular health, but it will absolutely help your appetite and allow you to eat more food. Think about how many calories you actually burn while doing cardio. Maybe a few hundred calories or so. It's really not that many when you break down the numbers and realize that the majority of our total daily energy expenditure occurs at rest, however, it does stimulate your metabolism and will boost your appetite more than enough to make up for those few hundred calories you burned off. So no, cardio during a bulk phase is not counterproductive unless you are doing excessive amounts. MK-677 (Ibutamoren) If you are researching how to increase your appetite via pharmacological intervention, MK-677 is probably the most effective ghrelin receptor agonist right now. MK-677 (also known as Ibutamoren) is not just a GH Secretagogue, it is also an oral ghrelin mimetic. Ghrelin is also known as the “hunger hormone.” It is a peptide that is secreted by your stomach that stimulates your appetite. When your stomach is empty, Ghrelin is produced to signal to your brain that you are hungry and need to eat. As you would expect, Ghrelin levels are high before meals, and low after finishing meals. This is how your body regulates its appetite and knows when to eat and when to stop eating. With growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRP’s) and growth hormone secretagogues (like MK-677) they function by stimulating the pituitary gland to pulse out GH. However, these GHRP’s and MK-677 also have a very significant effect on Ghrelin. The most notable being GHRP-6 and MK-677. These are both notorious for being appetite stimulating compounds. MK-677 can literally take you from a subpar appetite to being ravenous within one day of using it. GHRP-6 This growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP) works by stimulating the pituitary gland to release GH after it is injected. There are several GHRP’s, but GHRP-6 in particular has the most significant impact on ghrelin levels, substantially increasing them very quickly post-injection. I have used GHRP-6 many times in the past when I couldn’t even look at food and I knew I had a large meal coming up that I had to mow down. A quick 100 mcg shot has me able to eat anything in sight within 15 minutes of pinning it. If I was using GHRP-6 for its GH spike benefits, I couple it with a 100 mcg shot of Mod GRF 1-29 (a GHRH) to substantially compound the GH producing capabilities of the compound. Using it exclusively for appetite though, a 100 mcg shot of GHRP-6 on its own is more than sufficient. The benefit of GHRP-6 vs. MK-677 is you can time when you want to be hungry. Right after pinning GHRP-6, you can expect your appetite to soar within 10-20 minutes, and then return to baseline within a couple hours, whereas with MK-677 you will be VERY hungry all day long. This makes GHRP-6 better for specific situations you want to be hungrier for, like a reefed day or a huge carb up meal, whereas MK-677 is better for when your appetite just overall sucks and you need to be hungrier all day long. Even with my crappy appetite I could probably win some eating competitions by pinning GHRP-6 beforehand. Eat More Calorie Dense Foods This one is obvious but by eating more calorie dense foods you can get more calories into your system without feeling as full. More calorie dense foods typically become essential to incorporate in some capacity at one point or another for most individuals during an effective bulking phase to prevent plateaus. One of the first things I do when I’m transitioning from cutting to bulking is I start rotating out white meat meals for red meat meals. Red meat is far more fatty and has a lot more calories than chicken, fish, etc. so I can actually eat the same amount of food on my plate, but get more calories in by simply swapping the types of meat as I start to plateau in my weight gain. Another great strategy is to start adding Macadamia Nut Oil or Extra Virgin Olive Oil to your meats. Even adding 1 tablespoon onto 1 meal each time you plateau is a great way to increase your calories without having to eat a greater quantity of food. Eat Less Fiber It takes your body longer to process fiber-rich food than it does other food, which is why fibrous foods increase levels of satiety. While cutting, high amounts of fibrous foods are great because they leave you feeling full for a long time, but during a bulk this can be counter-productive because you want to get hungry again as soon as possible after each meal. Thus, reducing your intake of fiber-rich foods is a great strategy for keeping your appetite strong. Eat Faster This is an interesting one that you may or may not know about, but research has shown that your brain can take upwards of 20 minutes from the time you start eating to start sending signals through your body that it is full and satiated. So, if you simply eat your meals faster, you can beat this timeline and actually consume more food than you would normally be able to before feeling full. Wake Up Early This one is a major key. I find that when I sleep in (sometimes I sleep in as late as 2:00-3:00 PM) it is MUCH harder to get my meals in. If you are bulking my recommendation is that you get yourself into a consistent sleeping routine where you get to bed at a reasonable hour so you can wake up as early as possible and get started on your day, and get your first meal in before you would normally be able to. The earlier I wake up, the more food I can shove down my throat before I go to sleep, and the hungrier I actually am to eat those meals.

    "content": "Fat And Strong, Or Ripped And Weak?     Fat And Strong, Or Ripped And Weak?  There has been a tug of war for years between the preference of being strong but having a softer physique vs. being ripped but being considerably weaker than you could be. The concept of whether or not being a very low body fat percentage and being brutally strong are mutually exclusive traits has been debated for decades. If you have ever seen power lifter physiques, you probably have noticed that the majority of them aren’t lean whatsoever. They are the strongest humans on earth though. Bodybuilders on the other hand have tremendous muscular development, even more so than power lifters, but not as much strength as power lifters (except for very rare cases with genetic outliers). There is indeed a direct correlation between the two. As you put your body in a state of energy deficiency via dieting down to lose fat, you are depriving it of calories and nutrients that would be necessary to maximize your strength progress. A bodybuilder during preparation for a competition would be content with simply maintaining their strength while they get to insanely lean levels of body fat, and intentionally avoids heavy weights to minimize the risk of injury. Power lifters don’t have to worry about how good they look whatsoever, so they can eat in a calorie surplus constantly to always be gaining more strength. So Is There Such A Thing As A Strong AND Ripped Bodybuilder? Yes. There are many bodybuilders that are actually insanely strong. Essentially, yes you can become a hybrid athlete who is not only aesthetically pleasing with low levels of body fat, but also has a very impressive level of strength. Here’s the catch: You will NEVER be as strong as you could be or as lean as you could be unless you focus 100% of your attention on it. By watching your caloric intake strictly to maintain a certain level of body fat you are limiting your strength gains. By eating in a minor surplus to at least gain some strength, you will still pack on a little bit of extra fat and blur your definition a bit, and lose a decent amount of your visible muscular separation. I find it funny because on competition days, bodybuilders are so freaky looking with humongous shredded muscular development, but they are at the absolute weakest they have ever been despite looking like they could lift a car over their head. This is where prioritization becomes very important. What is most important to you? Myself, I used to strongly favor strength over muscular development. I became strong as a house, but I had a gross, fat, soft, marshmallow physique (in my opinion) that I wasn’t happy with. I totally changed my priorities around, and now I almost entirely favor maintaining an extremely low level of body fat. I have what would look like double the amount of usable muscle than I used to, to the average human eye. But, believe it or not, even with this greater level of muscular development, my strength is literally a fraction of what it used to be. Despite looking like I am probably ten fold stronger than I was a few years ago. Find Balance Between The Two If That’s What You Prefer A lot of guys will just straight up ask me, “what do I do to get shredded and gain size?” I can’t help but shake my head because those are the 2 most counterproductive goals to each other on the planet. Ultimately, it comes down to what is most important to you personally. While you can stay shredded and be very strong, this combined effort to achieve both goals makes maximizing your true potential in either category impossible as they will always be hindered by your desire to not totally give up one or the other.

    "date": "2017-04-29T07:09:59+00:00",
    "content": "T3 (Cytomel) Overview – What To Expect     T3, also known as Cytomel, Liothyronine Sodium, and Triiodothyronine, is one of the most commonly misunderstood drugs in not only bodybuilding, but in the medical community. I have spoken with several individuals who have had major issues with fat loss, and having a weak metabolism who actually were walking around for years with an undiagnosed Thyroid deficiency (hypothyroidism). Unfortunately, the method used to diagnose hypothyroidism, and autoimmune disorders that cause hypothyroidism is completely flawed, and 99% of physicians are utterly clueless as to what they are doing, or what their patients need to get healthy. Sorry for the rant, but Thyroid hormones are a controversial topic for me as I have seen far too many doctors completely screw over their patients by being utterly clueless in the subject. What Is T3? In layman’s terms, T3 is the hormone in your body that regulates how fast your metabolism is. The higher your T3 level is, the more calories you will burn, and the more fat loss potential you will have. T3 is a drug that is prescribed to those with hypothyroidism, but it is commonly used by bodybuilders and recreational lifters who want to reach a level of body fat that would be difficult to achieve without drug assistance. That isn’t to say that it is easy to get shredded on T3, it helps though. Typical T3 Dosages Determining the ideal T3 dosage will be based upon several factors. Typically, T3 for bodybuilding/fat loss purposes involves purposely ingesting a supraphysiological amount of T3 in order to increase your metabolism to a level that would otherwise be impossible. This can be achieved with as little as 25 mcg, however, not all T3 is created with equal quality. Despite T3 being an inexpensive drug, for some reason, the quality varies wildly between different sources. Ideally, you’d want to get your T3 from a pharmacy (and prescribed by your doctor of course), as that’s the only way to absolutely ensure it is dosed accurately. The standard dose for fat loss purposes ranges between 25 mcg – 75 mcg of T3. The standard starting dosage for treating Hypothyroidism is typically much lower (as low as 5-10 mcg per day), and may be titrated up based on your doctor's recommendation. Personally, I never go above 50 mcg because T3 can be very catabolic at higher dosages, as it doesn’t discriminate between muscle and stored fat, so the higher your T3 dose is, the more muscle it will rip off your body. 50 mcg – 75 mcg should be more than sufficient for anyone to reap the benefits of a supraphysiological dose of T3. Side Effects Once you get to the 100 mcg + range, you put yourself at a much higher risk of side effects like Tachycardia, muscle loss, anxiety, and feeling weak. Side effects that will be notable at any dose, but will be more pronounced the higher you dose T3 will be increased body temperature, increased hunger, and in some cases (I get this) constant muscle flatness. By muscle flatness I mean it is a lot harder to get a pump, and your muscles lack that pop that they have when they are properly glycogen loaded and hydrated. That is one of the first things I look for when I am determining if my T3 is legit or not. I get a notable increase in body temperature, and I notice I am much flatter at the gym and it’s a lot harder to get a pump. My appetite starts getting a lot more ravenous once I go above 50 mcg as well. At 75 mcg I am hungry pretty much all day long. Offsetting The Muscle Loss From T3 The only way you can offset the catabolism from a high dose of T3 is with anabolic assistance. Whichever compounds are used to achieve that, the fact remains that a supraphysiological amount of Anabolics will almost always be necessary to maintain 100% of one's hard earned muscle tissue when venturing into the higher dosage range of T3. Obviously it isn’t mandatory, but you will lose A LOT more muscle on T3 without any anabolic assistance than you would with it. How Much Fat Loss Can You Expect From T3 I’m going to be completely honest with you as addressing this question specifically is the main reason why I wanted to write this article. T3 is NOT some magical compound like some portray it to be that lets you eat whatever you want all day long and stay shredded. Usually the individuals who perpetuate this myth about T3 consider “lean” as hardly visible abs. For me though, being lean is being shredded at a single digit body fat %. You CANNOT get to single digit body fat % by eating like crap on T3 just because you are on T3. You still need to diet hard in a calorie deficit, keep training hard, and do your cardio; T3 will simply magnify how much body fat the body burns up during your cut. I honestly think I could reach very close to the same body fat % I do during my cutting phases without T3 at all (I’d probably end my cut at 1-2% higher than I usually would), it would probably take me a month longer or so though. Basically, T3 speeds everything up and makes things a bit easier. It IS NOT an excuse to eat like crap though. You can get fatter even on T3 + DNP if you overeat. Trust me, I have. Does T3 Suppress Your Natural Thyroid Production? Yes, taking exogenous thyroid hormone will absolutely stop your natural production. Basically how your thyroid gland works is it has a stimulating hormone called TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) that is present at a certain level to signal your thyroid gland how much T4 it needs to produce, which then will get converted to the active form of thyroid hormone (the one we want) T3. When you take exogenous T3, your TSH plummets to near 0 because your body will recognize that there is already so much T3 in your system, that it has no need to produce any on its’ own. So your thyroid essentially goes to sleep for the duration of time you are taking T3. However, once you stop taking T3, your body will recognize there is no longer an excess amount of T3 in your system, and your TSH will skyrocket back up to signal your thyroid gland to start producing thyroid hormone again. There is NO SUCH THING as complete thyroid shutdown. Your thyroid will never be permanently destroyed from taking T3, and once you come off of T3, if you had a healthy thyroid to begin with, you will eventually recover to healthy natural thyroid function again. Typically, this recovery process takes a few weeks, but for others it can take substantially longer. It is all individually dependent. Personally, I have never had my thyroid suppressed for more than a couple weeks, even after staying on 50 mcg T3 for nearly a year straight. Why T3 Is My Favorite Fat Burning Agent I use it almost every single time I cut because it is one of the few things that works really great, and isn’t a stimulant. Granted, both T3 and stimulants can create cardiovascular complications if abused, I simply prefer T3 if I had to only choose one thing to use as a fat burner. I barely even notice T3 aside from slightly increased body temperature and a slightly faster resting heart rate, whereas with Clen my resting heart rate is borderline tachycardic and I can't combine it with any other stimulants that day without fearing some significant cardiovascular disaster. I also prefer it to DNP simply because DNP makes me feel like I’m dragging so much ass I can barely get myself to the gym to train, and I’m actually twice as flat and my workouts are complete garbage on DNP. Bottom line, T3 works, but it isn’t a magic pill that will get you shredded overnight. How To Know If Your T3 Is Legit Like I mentioned earlier, there are various sources for T3 and their quality varies. Obviously the best place to get it would be a pharmacy after being prescribed it by a doctor for treating Hypothyroidism if you have it. However, if you want to assess how potent your T3 is and see if the dose you are using is adequate for whatever you are using it for, then you need to get blood work to see how it is affecting your values, and know how to interpret them rather than trust some arbitrary dosage number that a doctor throws at you (doctors are notorious for doing this with hormone replacement therapy). These are the main things you want to look at: March 28, 2017 Bloodwork Results As you can see from my blood work, my TSH and T4 levels are absolutely tanked. This is because I have so much exogenous T3 in my body from the T3 I’m using, that my thyroid gland has completely gone to sleep (temporarily). This means that my body is HYPERthyroid (supraphysiological range of T3) during that test. You want your T3 in range if you are treating Hypothyroidism. In Canada they won't show you your T3 values in most cases (because most doctors here are clueless how to treat Hypothyroidism or anything hormone related) but if your TSH and T4 are in the toilet, you can be assured that your T3 is sky high (in most cases). Now, if your TSH was in the normal range or high, then that's a different story. Typically:  TSH in range = Thyroid functioning as normal and your T3 is probably bunk TSH high and out of range = Thyroid is trying extremely hard to produce more T4 (to ultimately convert to/increase your T3 into a healthy range) becuase:  A) You are Hypothyroid at the moment because you either just came off of legit T3 within the last week or two and your Thyroid is in the process of recovering natural function (meaning the T3 you are currently using is bunk) B) Or you have a crappy Thyroid gland and just have terrible natural thyroid production and likely require T4 or T3 to just maintain a healthy T3 level (meaning the T3 you are currently using is bunk)    Disclaimer: The information included in this article is intended for entertainment and informational purposes only.

    "content": "How Much Muscle Can You Gain From A Steroid Cycle Or SARMs Cycle?     “How much muscle can you gain from a steroid cycle” or “how much muscle should I expect to gain from (insert name of any anabolic compound here) is probably the most common question I get asked. I get a lot of questions about expectations for an upcoming cycle, AKA “Hey Derek, if I take ______ and ______ how much muscle will I gain?” The general answer to that question is you will gain somewhere between 0 – 20 pounds of muscle, with the more likely answer being closer to 0-10 pounds of muscle. Not the answer you were looking for I bet. 99% of guys who are brand new to performance enhancement want to know if they take X compound, exactly how many pounds of muscle will it equate to gaining. This question is impossible to answer and I’m going to break down for you exactly why. Genetic Response To Drugs First of all, let’s talk about genetic response to drugs. This is going to be one of the main factors determining how much “gains” you get from a cycle. If you’ve ever looked at the progression of a pro bodybuilder, you will probably notice that even if they started out with an average physique, once they committed their lives to bodybuilding their physiques exploded. These individuals have an amazing genetic response to performance enhancing drugs, and it allows them to reach superhuman levels of muscle mass very quickly. Dorian Yates is a great example. Before training he was just a normal looking skinny kid.  No different than you or I, but he had an insane response to drugs. No amount of training or diet can make up the difference between a guy with average or even above average genetics, and hyperresponders. Within only 9 months of training Dorian had already gained more muscle than most guys will gain through an entire lifetime of working out.  Kevin Levrone and Phil Heath are a couple more great examples.  Before taking bodybuilding seriously, they were just normal looking kids. As soon as they started though, they blew up.   They didn't gain 100 pounds of muscle off of 1 cycle obviously, however, genetically they most likely have a lower amount of Myostatin in the body naturally, thereby inhibiting their body from regulating how much muscle they can pack on. Now, if average Joe with average Joe genetic response to anabolics took the exact same drugs, he probably wouldn’t even gain half as much muscle as the pro bodybuilder did who took those drugs. Why is this you ask? Well, beyond the possibility of the pro bodybuilder training harder and eating better than the average Joe, the most likely reason is that the pro bodybuilder’s body simply responds far better to anabolics than the average human and they have less Myostatin. This is why if you injected absurd amounts of steroids into yourself every week you would never look like Jay Cutler, even if you were taking more drugs than he did. Genetic response is HUGE in determining a bodybuilder’s development. If we took two guys, with the exact same diet and workout routine and gave them the exact same cycle, their gains would NOT be exactly the same. There would be a difference, and that difference would be dictated by their genetics/genetic response to drugs. Training Smart If you train like crap and have zero intensity, don’t try to utilize progressive overload, don’t get a pump, don’t contract the muscle during your reps, or a variety of other factors, you will get subpar results. So, when someone simply asks in general “how much muscle can you gain from a steroid cycle” this is impossible to answer because I have no idea what your training is like, or if you even know how to train at all. This is another factor that will greatly impact your overall results. If you took two guys with the exact same diet, genetic response to drugs, and gave them the same cycle, but one of them trained hard several times per week and meticulously utilizes progressive overload and uses perfect form, and the other guy uses improper form, trains lazily, skips the gym sometimes and just doesn’t know what he’s doing even when he is there, obviously the first guy will gain more muscle mass despite all those other factors being exactly the same. Diet Just like the previous two factors, diet also plays a huge role in your results. If you are trying to pack on as much muscle as possible, but you aren’t eating enough, or you eat like crap 24/7, your body composition and cycle results will reflect this. On the opposite side of the spectrum, if your diet is spot on and you are eating enough macronutrients to replenish, recover, and grow, your cycle results will reflect this and you will have much better results than the other guy who eats McDonalds three times per day for his bulking diet. As annoying as it is, the guy who hyperresponds to drugs will still gain more muscle than you though even if he's eating McDonalds and crap all day.  Obviously the hyperresponder's results would improve as he became more regimented with his diet though too.  Even if you're a hyperresponder to drugs you will still need a sufficient amount of calories present to grow, your genetic limits are just far higher than the average guy. In Conclusion How much muscle can you gain from a steroid cycle is an unanswerable question and is only something you will learn for yourself from experience as you learn how your body responds to different compounds and factors related to your diet and training. Embarking on your first steroid cycle, prohormone cycle, SARMs cycle, etc. and asking a third party who has never met you exactly how much muscle you will gain from such and such compound is an impossible question to answer as every one has completely different genetics, hormone profiles, lifting intensity, adherence to a strict diet, drug response, among countless other factors.

    "content": "What Is The Best Creed Aventus Clone?      Creed Aventus http://amzn.to/2pj58QZ  Creed Aventus is one of the most highly regarded (if not the most) fragrances in the world. It has gained an unparalleled level of respect among fragrance enthusiasts, as well as even small-time collectors. The reason being that it is not only an amazing scent with fantastic performance, but it is so damn unique that it is highly unlikely anyone else will ever be wearing the same fragrance as you, and who doesn’t want to stand out from the crowd with something totally unique. It definitely is in a class of its’ own in some regards, and is absolutely a lady killer. Do I think it’s as amazing as it’s hyped up to be by many fragrance fanatics? No I don’t. However, I DO agree that it is VERY good. I wouldn’t spend $300+ on a fragrance though that I’m not completely enamored with. Hence why I started expressing interest in some of the “Creed Aventus clones” on the market that I had heard about. There are 2 fragrances in particular that are very well known for being nearly indiscernible from Creed Aventus. Those fragrances are Armaf Club De Nuit Intense Man, and Reyane Tradition Insurrection Pure II. Club De Nuit Intense Man Vs. Insurrection Pure II http://amzn.to/2nSoBGQ  http://amzn.to/2mhyIpL    Now, the question on everybody’s mind is which of these is the better Creed Aventus clone. Well, off the bat I can say one thing, they both have the same dry down as Creed Aventus (or as close as you’re going to get to it). The top notes is where there is a big difference in these fragrances. Insurrection Pure II, Club De Nuit Intense Man, and Creed Aventus share nearly the exact same notes from top to bottom, with blatant bergamot, apple and pineapple top notes. Insurrection Pure II is much closer to Creed Aventus in this opening, whereas Club De Nuit Intense has a very sharp lemon top note. Now, for very hardcore frag heads who actually know the differences between the Creed Aventus batches, there are in fact some batches with the noticeable lemon note too. However, I find that the lemon top note is so harsh, and the dry down takes so long to come with Club De Nuit Intense, that it ruins the scent for me almost entirely. Insurrection Pure II on the other hand is far closer of a match to the predominantly smokey, woody, pineapple batches of Creed Aventus. These batches I prefer far more myself, and it seems that the ladies do as well that I asked. Basically, the only stark difference between Club De Nuit Intense and Insurrection Pure II is that heavy-duty lemon top note. I much prefer Insurrection Pure II and will stick with it in the future as my Creed Aventus clone. The Only Time You Should Buy A Bottle Of Creed Aventus (In My Opinion)  You are a collector You have lots of disposable income You absolutely want the extra strong beast-mode performance that Creed Aventus has  If you don't fall into any of those categories, then you should stick with Insurrection Pure II as it will absolutely suffice as an amazing Creed Aventus clone that is so close scent wise, that even many frag heads wouldn’t be able to tell the difference blind folded, and it is less than 1/10th of the price.

    "content": "The Purpose Of Steroids And SARMs During A Cut Phase     Let’s talk about the purpose served by Steroids and SARMs during a cut phase. I get a lot of questions about expectations for an upcoming cycle, AKA “Hey Derek, if I take ______ and ______ how much muscle will I gain?” First of all, this is an impossible question to answer as every one has completely different genetics, hormone profiles, lifting intensity, adherence to a strict diet, PED response, among countless other factors. But, for the sake of this article, I’m going to tell you exactly what you should expect gains wise from a cycle of SARMs during a cut, or even a steroid cycle for that matter. The answer is… NOTHING Yes you read that correctly. Nothing. That’s exactly what you should expect while using any anabolics in a steep calorie deficit. Unless it’s your first cycle ever, or you have taken a lot of time off from anabolics and have lost muscle as a result and are about to hop back on a cycle, or you are a complete newbie to lifting in general, you should NEVER expect to make gains during a cut. The purpose of using Steroids or SARMs during a cut phase is simply to PRESERVE WHAT YOU HAVE. Your body is in an energy deficit, and is clamoring to use stored energy as fuel to prevent itself from starving essentially. Do you really think this is an ideal environment for putting on muscle? Of course not. Even with anabolic steroids involved. What happens when you are in a calorie deficit and trying to lose fat is your body dips into stored energy to fuel itself, as it isn’t being fed enough to maintain itself. So, what happens when it dips into stored energy is it starts utilizing stored glycogen, stored fat (what you want to lose), and STORED MUSCLE PROTEIN. Stored muscle protein is just another way of saying the body will breakdown your hard earned muscle to fuel itself, resulting in a loss of muscle mass. So, the amazing thing about SARMs and Steroids is that they are incredibly effective at muscle sparing. What I mean by this is that they jack up your hormonal profile to a level where it is far less likely to enter a state of catabolism, where your body will start breaking down your muscle tissue, and instead it will simply pull energy from your stored glycogen and body fat. The goal of every cut should be to maintain your same level of strength from the start of the cut, to the end of the cut, as this will help preserve your lean muscle as well. If you gain literally nothing, but maintain every single pound of muscle on your body during a cut, you can absolutely call that cut a success. Getting shredded isn’t easy, and getting shredded without losing muscle is absolutely impossible if you are not hormonally enhanced to some degree. Whether that be via SARMs or via Steroids, the whole point of using an anabolic compound during a cutting phase is simply to maintain your strength and size, and if you can accomplish just that while still simultaneously getting shredded, then the compounds you used absolutely did exactly what they should do, and expecting more from them when you are in a massively deprived state is just naïve wishful thinking.

    "date": "2017-04-04T10:27:07+00:00",
    "content": "The Best Penis Extender Device – Phallosan Forte Review     What Is The Phallosan Forte The Phallosan Forte is a Penis extender that is used to increase overall Penis size, improve Penile blood flow/circulation, and treat Peyronie's Disease (straighten out a bent or curved Penis). The Phallosan Forte’s primary use is of course for Penis enlargement. If You Just Came Here To Order A Phallosan Forte –  You can use the following link to order from the only official Phallosan Forte manufacturer in the world.  There are many fakes and imitations being sold all over the internet, but be aware that there is in only one legitimate manufacturer of the Phallosan Forte, and that is the one linked above. What Size Gains Can You Expect From The Phallosan Forte While there are several anecdotal logs that can be found online, there was 1 very notable clinical study that assessed the progress that can be made with the Phallosan Forte within 6 months. There were 36 test patients in the clinical study.  Length Gain Results After Wearing The Device for 6 months, 9 Hours Per Day, 6 Days Per Week:  The highest result achieved after 6 months in length at non-erect/erect stage was 4.9 cm (1.9 inches) / 4.0 cm (1.47 inches) Girth Gain Results After Wearing The Device for 6 months, 9 Hours Per Day, 6 Days Per Week: The highest result achieved after 6 months in girth at non-erect/erect stage was 2.5 cm (0.98 inch) / 2.1 cm (0.82 inch). This was achieved within 6 months wearing the device 9 hours per day (achievable almost entirely wearing it just during sleep), 6 days per week. An average was also recorded among those who wore the device less.  The clinical study I am referring to can be found here for your reference: http://www.phallosan.com/fileadmin/doc/PHALLOSAN-clinical-study-en.pdf Ultimately, the longer and more frequent you can wear this device, the more growth potential you will have. Much like bodybuilding, Penis Enhancement (PE) is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes consistency and commitment to see big results. Obviously the growth potential is much higher if you wear this device for years, coupled with other effective PE activities like Bathmate pumping, and manual stretching/jelqing. This is the easiest form of PE though as there is literally no time commitment necessary. You just need to strap the thing on and then go about your life. The Best Penis Enhancement Solution For Lazy Guys If you have delved into PE, you probably have come to realize that to truly get fantastic results, a significant amount of time must be dedicated to it. PE is a marathon, not a sprint, and it works much like bodybuilding does in the sense that the Penis works via progressive overload, adapting to stress (stretching or pumping) in a slow manner, eventually resulting in size gains to offset the stress being exerted upon it. One of the absolute best ways to get substantial length gains is via manual stretching. However, it can take up a huge chunk of your time several days per week to stay dedicated to a manual stretching routine that will equate to worthwhile size gains. This is where a Penis extender becomes a VERY attractive alternative. By using an extender, you can continuously keep your Penis in a stretched position with an adequate amount of tension on it stimulating maximum growth, for several hours on end without having to dedicate a single minute to any stretching. This is because the extender does all the work for you, keeping you stretching all day long (or however many hours you decide to keep it on for), while you go about your daily activities uninterrupted and without having to waste precious time pulling on your Johnson. You Can Wear The Phallosan Forte While You Sleep The main pitfall of most Penis extenders is that they place the Penis in a restrictive position, where getting an erection or moving in particular ways will cause severe restriction of blood flow. While this is manageable in the daytime as adjustments can be made on the fly, it presents a huge danger if you are wishing to simply wear your extender while you sleep. With other extenders, you absolutely cannot wear them while you sleep, or else you could cause injury or damage to yourself. The Phallosan Forte is unique in that it is the first Penis extender that you can wear safely while you sleep. This is HUGE for guys who don’t want to walk around all day with an extender hanging off of their body. With the Phallosan Forte, you can simply put it on each night before bed, and sleep through the night while it does its’ job and safely stretches you. Phallosan Forte Vs. Other Penis Extenders Prior to discovering the Phallosan Forte, I actually bought a couple other Penis extenders that also worked fairly well, but the main issue with them was they were much more uncomfortable, and I was forced to wear them throughout the day when I was active and moving around, which was an inconvenience many times. The Phallosan is not only far more comfortable than other “top” extenders, but it can be worn while you sleep. I sleep 8-10 hours per day; so simply wearing the device throughout the night provides sufficient enough use to produce some great size gains. Checkout the comparison charts below that compare the benefits of Phallosan Forte to all the other popular extenders on the market:      Other Phallosan Forte Reviews           The Only FDA Approved Male Enhancement Device How Phallosan managed to get their PE device approved by the FDA is beyond me, but they are the first company to succeed in doing this. As a result, they are the only company who has authentic clinical studies that back their extender’s effectiveness, has urologists recommend their extender to patients, has their extender available in pharmacies, and can get customers’ purchase costs covered by their health insurance. The FDA approved the Phallosan Forte in November, 2013, and if you go to their website you can see it for yourself on their approved list. How Phallosan Forte Works And How To Use It  The video above details in elaborate detail exactly how the Phallosan Forte works and how to put the Phallosan Forte on. After you learn how to put it on, all you need to do is set the device to your required level of resistance, and then let it do its’ job.  Start LOW, do not jump the gun and go to the strongest level of tension. Taper your way up to it SLOWLY, as your Penis adjusts and stretches over the coming weeks. One tip that you should note as well, switch sides with the Phallosan Forte. By that I mean don’t simply wear it to the left side every single time you use it, or to the right side every time either. Switch sides each time you use it. If you just used it overnight and were stretched to the left side of your body, next time you put it on use it on the other side of your body, stretching to the right side of your body. This will prevent any possible imbalances you would get by stretching your Penis solely to once side each and every time. Combining The Bathmate, Phallosan Forte, And Manual Exercises For Maximum Gains The Phallosan Forte is more than sufficient to provide substantial size gains, especially for newbies. However, you can expedite your results, as well as achieve more overall size by implementing other effective PE techniques.  Bathmate:   The Bathmate Hydropump is the world's most effective Penis Enhancement pump that will add both length and girth to your penis. Bathmate keeps the process fun, immediately pumps up your penis for sex (partner will absolutely notice and appreciate your added size) and slowly but surely – adds permanent size over many months.  Jelqing And Stretching:  Jelqing and stretching are manual exercises that are bar none the most effective non-device related PE techniques. You can easily pack an inch or so on using just these exercises with a high level of commitment and a consistent training regimen. Other Benefits Of The Phallosan Forte The Phallosan Forte is mainly used for increasing overall Penis size, although it has a couple other notable benefits as well. One of them is improved circulation in the Penis. By creating painless micro-fissures in the Penis during stretching (like in bodybuilding), space for new cell material is created in the Penis, and when recovery occurs, the result is greater overall size with a greater capacity for blood flow, consequently resulting in stronger erections. In addition, via the continuous stretching/tension of the device, the Phallosan Forte can correct Penis curvatures, eventually completely straightening out a bent or curved Penis with adequate device usage. Discrete Shipping/Packaging I know the first concern many guys have who live with their family ordering these devices is wondering if a box show up with dick extender pictures plastered all over it. Ease your mind; your dick enhancement endeavors will remain a secret as the box it shows up in is packaged very discreetly without any images or text that could suggest the contents. Even the shipping documents and the invoice in the packaging are discreet. An order will take no more than 3-5 business days to arrive in the worst-case scenario (you live in some obscure far away area). If you order and you don’t receive a confirmation email shortly afterwards, don’t stress, it’s probably just sitting in your spam/junk box. If you use Hotmail or Gmail the confirmation email is probably sitting in there. This is simply how email providers work because in almost every single case, male enhancement related emails are actually spam/junk, it has nothing to do with the legitimacy of the vendor so don’t stress. Where To Get A Legitimate Phallosan Forte Device + Free Add-ons There is only 1 legitimate Official Phallosan Forte Manufacturer in the world, and I have linked it below for you:  By using this link, you are ensuring you are getting a 100% authentic Phallosan Forte product, straight from the manufacturer themselves. Don’t risk getting a fake product just because you saw a cheaper price somewhere else. If it looks to good to be true and is cheaper than the official manufacturer’s price, it’s probably fake. In addition, by ordering through this link you will receive 4 FREE CONDOM SLEEVES with your order. The condom sleeves keep your Penis in a stretched position and are a necessity for using the device. These sleeves can rip, so having extras on hand is highly suggested.

    "content": "How To Make Your Fragrances/Colognes TWICE As Strong      For years I went about my life completely unaware of why fragrances performed so terribly on my skin. I chalked it up to just poor luck, but after looking into it a bit, it became blatantly obvious the reason why this was happening was my dry skin. My skin is very dry, and to have a fragrance perform even averagely on my skin, I need to be using one of the heavy hitter “Beast Mode” fragrances. If Salvatore Ferragamo F Black, Armani Code Profumo, and other heavy hitters are only performing averagely on your skin, the root of your issue is likely the same as mine. The oilier your skin is, the more your fragrance will soak in and stay there for a long period of time. The dryer your skin is, the faster your skin will flake off essentially and in turn also get rid of your fragrance. When it came to average performing fragrances, these would become a skin scent on me within an hour. So I did some searching online and I came across a VERY helpful tip. This tip literally can increase the double the performance of your fragrances. That tip is, to apply Vaseline to where you are applying your fragrance.    For me, I apply Vaseline behind both of my ears, and on my wrists (a common pulse point used for fragrance application). I’m not just talking about a moisturizer, I mean literally Vaseline. Vaseline will stay on your skin all day and not dissipate into your skin quickly like a common moisturizer would. Once you apply your fragrance to the spots on your skin where you have applied Vaseline, you will likely notice a vast improvement in performance (at least I did). Some of my favorite fragrances that would turn into a skin scent within a couple hours on my dry skin would last all day long and project twice as far.

    "content": "Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) While On A Steroid Cycle – Do NOT Use One Until You Read This     Why You Shouldn’t Have A Predetermined Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) Dose One colossal mistake I see widespread among bodybuilders and recreational enhanced lifters is that they have a predetermined dosage set for their Aromatase Inhibitor (AI). It seems that AI usage has become so commonplace that users don’t even bother to understand the purpose of the drug in the first place prior to implementing it into their regimen. Nowadays, AI’s are treated almost as on-cycle essentials, and are simply a necessity just like your multivitamin you pop each day is. This couldn’t be further from the truth, and it explains why many individuals embark on their anabolic cycles with a misconception that they need an AI in there at a particular dosage to “prevent side effects.” I can’t even count how many times I’ve seen a guy propose his entire cycle layout asking for feedback, and for some strange reason his AI dose is already determined prior to the cycle, and stays constant for the entire duration of the cycle despite other changes in aromatizing compounds occurring during the cycle. Here’s an example of what I’m talking about: “Hey guys, newbie to AAS here and wanted to run my cycle by you guys and see if you have any feedback or changes you would make.  Week 1-12: Test E 750 mg Week 1-12: Equipoise 700 mg Week 1-4: Dbol 40 mg per day Week 8-12: Anavar 50 mg per day Week 1-12: Arimidex 0.5 mg per day Week 14-16: Nolvadex 40 mg per day Week 14-16: Clomid 100 mg per day Week 16-18: Nolvadex 20 mg per day Week 16-18: Clomid 50 mg per day” Now, to the average steroid user, that probably doesn’t look like a bad cycle outline and they may even be asking themselves what exactly is wrong with this. Look closer, from week 1-12 the guy has proposed that he will be using 0.5 mg per day of Arimidex. So, basically, if he knows what the point of having Arimidex is in a cycle, you would think he’d realize the point of Arimidex is to keep your Estrogen in check. However, if you understand how these drugs work in the first place, you will understand there is a compounding effect with everything, and they take several weeks to fully saturate in your system. Some longer than others. In the case of this cycle, there are 2 heavily aromatizing compounds in there for the first 4 weeks (Test E and Dbol). Then, for the next 8 weeks he’s completely off of Dbol and adds in Anavar at the end for 4 weeks. So, it should be pretty obvious by now that there is a vastly different amount of aromatization occurring at different points of this cycle. Even with the Test E, after his first couple shots, will there be as much test circulating in his system as there will be once the drug has fully saturated in the blood stream 5 weeks later in the cycle? Of course not. So, if there’s not as much test circulating in his system as it hasn’t fully built up yet, there won’t be as much Estrogen in his system. So, if there is differing amounts of aromatization occurring at different points of this cycle, as well as saturation levels increasing at different rates and heavily aromatizing compounds being swapped in and out of the cycle, does it make sense to be using the exact same dose of Aromatase Inhibitor for the entirety of this cycle? NO! This is the point I’m trying to drive home with this article. At the start of your cycle, these drugs are just entering your blood and haven’t even reached saturation levels, yet, a predetermined dose of Arimidex is being used to combat aromatization that may not even need addressing at the time, and that same predetermined dose is used later in the cycle where the amount of aromatization will be vastly different. How can you expect to keep your Estrogen levels in the sweet spot with a predetermined dosage of your Aromatase Inhibitor? Long story short, you can’t, unless you have been using the exact same compound for a very long period of time and have definitively concluded via blood work what dosage of that particular compound equates to a particular level of Estrogen aromatization in the body. Why This Is A HUGE Problem In The Medical Community Too If you've read any of my posts about hormones, you probably already know by now how little faith I have in most general doctors when it comes to properly addressing underlying hormonal deficiencies and imbalances. Depending on where you live, getting prescribed TRT for insufficient natural Testosterone production is a challenge in itself (many doctors will tell a 21 year old they are fine and healthy even if their blood work indicates their Testosterone is equivalent to the “normal” of an 80 year old geezer). Then, after actually getting on TRT, another challenge often rears its ugly head, and that is Estrogen control, and how to go about doing it safely and most effectively. Just the other day I had a consultation with a guy who told me about how he is on 150 mg of Testosterone per week for his TRT, and his doctor put him on 1 mg of Arimidex every day for his Aromatase Inhibitor. I was STUNNED. Well actually, not really, because there are a disturbing amount of doctors entrusted to treat patients properly who are actually completely incompetent when it comes to proper treatment during HRT. However, this was beyond excessive. This guy was literally on the second strongest Aromatase Inhibitor there is, for a dosage of Testosterone that just keeps his Test levels at high-normal. And not only that, he was on 1 mg per day. I wouldn't need that much of an Aromatase Inhibitor even if I was on 5x as much Testosterone as he is on per week. So as expected, his libido nose dived, his dick ceased to work properly (no erections), he had insanely dry and achy joints, among a myriad of other horrible side effects. But basically, he felt like shit. This is EXACTLY why when you are utilizing a drug that aromatizes into Estrogen and an AI may become necessary, you get baseline blood work, and then when you add an AI in, you use a very conservative dose of the most mild and forgiving AI there is (depending on what/how much aromatizing hormones you're using), and titrate up accordingly based on your blood work until you've reached the Estrogen sweet spot (or based on symptoms which is the “bro” method which is not recommended). E.G. my TRT is also 150 mg per week, and I literally only need to use 12.5 mg of Aromasin once a week to keep my Estrogen in the sweet spot. Obviously the requirements will vary individual to individual dependent on your own genetic predispositions, but nobody would EVER need 1 mg of Arimidex everyday for TRT, and if they did they would be an extreme genetic outlier scenario, and even in a scenario like that I would bet money their Estrogen was actually in the toilet, or their Arimidex was fake/underdosed. What’s The Estrogen Sweet Spot And How To Stay There Typically, most men feel their best when their estrogen levels lie between 20-30 pg/ml in their blood work. This is the target “estrogen sweet spot” you want to shoot for to feel amazing and improve your quality of life substantially. If you start to get too far above this level, you can start to experience symptoms of high Estrogen. If you start to get too far below this level, you can start to experience symptoms of low Estrogen. Both scenarios are very unpleasant to say the least. So, the key to staying in the sweet spot is getting your blood work done, and adjusting your AI dose accordingly based upon your current Aromatase Inhibitor needs. If your Estrogen is too high, then you need to slightly increase your AI dose, or switch to a stronger one and start the titration process over again. If your Estrogen is too low, then you need to slightly lower your AI dose, or switch to a weaker one and start the titration process over again. It isn’t rocket science, however, many users seem to have completely neglected to comprehend why they are using an AI in the first place, and what purpose it serves. If I kept my AI dosage constant like that during a cycle (by cycle I mean a blast phase of a supraphysiological amount of highly aromatizing hormones), my experience would more than likely start out with me feeling symptoms of low estrogen, followed by symptoms of high estrogen later in the cycle once my level of aromatization had surpassed the inhibitory capacity of that particular dosage of AI. The First Thing You Should Do If you have any of the traditional symptoms of high estrogen or low estrogen, you should first and foremost get blood work with a sensitive assay test to see where your estrogen levels lie. Some labs use a standard assay test, which is tailored for women almost exclusively, so you would be wise to request the “sensitive” assay version. Even with high testosterone levels, you can still experience ALL of the unwanted side effects of out of range estrogen levels if they are too high or low. Common symptoms of high estrogen include:  Acne, oily skin Erectile dysfunction Low libido Lethargy Gynecomastia (man boobs) Aggression and bitchiness Depression Water retention High blood pressure Enlarged prostate Shrunken testicles Sugar cravings  Common symptoms of low estrogen include:  Dull weak orgasms Dry skin and lips Dehydration Low libido Irritability Mood swings Loss of appetite Fatigue Lethargy  These are all quite unpleasant side effects, and it isn’t uncommon to experience several of them at once if your estrogen levels remain too high or low. After seeing where your Estrogen levels lie, you can decide what dose of AI, and which AI is appropriate to combat those symptoms. If these symptoms go away and your sex drive is perfect, you have no erectile dysfunction issues, etc. you can conclude that your dosage of AI is satisfactory for the time being. Obviously the best way to confirm where your Estrogen levels lie though is via blood work. However, it isn’t uncommon for individuals to overshoot the Estrogen sweet spot, and tank their Estrogen without even knowing it. This is far less likely to happen with the weaker AI’s like Arimistane and Aromasin, but it is very common with Arimidex and Letrozole. The goal you should have is to keep your Estrogen between 20-30 pg/ml for the entirety of your cycle, regardless of what dosage of AI is necessary to achieve that.  Using a predetermined dosage for your AI simply makes zero sense. Which Aromatase Inhibitor Is Weakest And Which Is The Strongest  Arimistane (greatest margin of error, weakest aromatase inhibitor) Aromasin (high margin of error, fairly strong aromatase inhibitor) Arimidex (low margin of error, fairly easy to crash Estrogen unless on a high dose of aromatizing compounds, very strong aromatase inhibitor) Letrozole (minimal margin of error, VERY easy to crash Estrogen by accident, even on tons of aromatizing compounds, the strongest aromatase inhibitor)  Keep in mind, Arimistane is the only over the counter Aromatase Inhibitor on that list, the other three are Rx AI's, and can only be obtained via a prescription from your doctor and should only be used under the direction of your doctor.  In Conclusion Which Aromatase Inhibitor you should choose and the dosage you use should be based on your own individual propensity to aromatization, what your blood work indicates, the dosage of the aromatizing drugs you are using, etc. E.G. if your TRT is 125 mg per week for example, and your doctor is giving you 0.5 mg of Arimidex twice per week, and after several weeks utilizing that protocol you get a blood test and your Estrogen levels show that you have a 5.5 pg/ml reading, you are using too much Arimidex, and probably shouldn't even be using Arimidex in the first place as such a little amount of it is crashing your Estrogen and it is too powerful of an AI for your particular needs. Electing for a weaker AI in that scenario would be wise, and starting with a very conservative amount of it. Some guys don't even need an Aromatase Inhibitor at all, which is also something to keep in mind. The usage requirements of Aromatase Inhibitors while on SARMs will greatly differ from that of traditional aromatizing Steroids as well, which needs to be taken into consideration if that's what you are using. If your doctor is forcing drugs like Arimidex on you, be 100% sure you understand how to interpret your blood work before you start popping pills and hurt yourself.

    "content": "Clenbuterol Fat Loss Results (Overview and Common Clenbuterol Myths)     Clenbuterol General Overview Clenbuterol is a compound I have used countless times. Without delving into too much boring information about what Clenbuterol is actually prescribed for (it is a bronchodilator used to treat breathing disorders like asthma), I use it exclusively for its’ fat burning properties. Clenbuterol stimulates the metabolism by increasing the temperature of the body. Via this mechanism of action, Clenbuterol is a fairly effective thermogenic compound that allows the body to burn fat at a greater rate. The Protocol I Use For Clenbuterol After trying countless different protocols over the years, I have settled on what works best for me. That protocol is a very gradual, slow titration up in the dose over the span of 8-12 weeks (however long my cut lasts). By the end of my cut (5-7% body fat usually) my dosage typically ends up being 80-100mcg. I have never exceeded 120mcg and I never will (and neither should you). I always start on the very low end of dosing, which is 20mcg. Clenbuterol tolerance works just like caffeine does, where you can get away with a very low dosage at the start of use and reap the maximum benefits from it, but as time goes on with continuous use, your tolerance builds up quick and the dosage must be titrated up to maintain the same max benefit. Starting low with Clenbuterol is absolutely key though, because just like overdosing on caffeine, if you take more Clenbuterol than your body can handle, you will put your cardiovascular system into overdrive and could cause some major health complications. Clenbuterol Myths  1) It Will Get You Ripped Without Dieting This should be obvious but unfortunately a lot of people perceive Clenbuterol as a magic pill of sorts that will get you shredded just by popping a few pills per day. This couldn’t be any further from the truth. If you are fat with your current diet, just adding Clenbuterol into your regimen with no alteration in diet or cardio will probably shave a few % off your current body fat percentage, but it will not take you from 20% to 10% without changing anything. Clenbuterol is simply that extra boost that will help you go from lean, to very lean. Clenbuterol also has an apparent cosmetic drying out effect which is beneficial to a more polished physique as well. Whenever I use Clen, I notice within days that my physique looks a bit dryer, and my face looks a bit leaner. 2) 2 Weeks On 2 Weeks Off Protocol  One of the biggest myths in bodybuilding that is practically treated as gospel by some individuals is the theory that Clenbuterol absolutely must be cycled off of completely every 2 weeks to allow beta-2 receptors to upregulate and recover sensitivity. What most people don’t realize is that the Clenbuterol is still working after 2 weeks, it is simply not as effective. After 2-3 weeks is the time I bump the dose another 20mcg. By bumping it up in this gradual manner, an increased metabolic rate can be taken advantage of for the entire duration of the cutting phase, as opposed to having heightened fat-burning potential for only 2 weeks on, and then taking 2 weeks off before you can reap those benefits again. This protocol has been shoved down the throats of bodybuilders for so long and by so many people that it has gotten severe enough that people think Clenbuterol is useless after 2 weeks, and it is an absolute necessity to come off of it at that point. This is absolutely NOT the case. 3) Benadryl For Beta-2 Receptor Upregulation This myth has been around for many years, and I have no idea how it manifested itself because it is completely bogus. The theory behind it is that by using Benadryl each day with your Clenbuterol you can keep the beta-2 receptors upregulated for the entirety of your cutting phase, consequently allowing you to use Clenbuterol at the same dose throughout your whole cycle without losing effectiveness. The reason why Clenbuterol loses effectiveness after prolonged usage is that it causes the beta-2 receptors to downregulate. If you can keep those receptors upregulated then you would never lose sensitivity to Clenbuterol. Despite Benadryl being an antihistamine, it actually exerts no upregulation of the beta-2 receptors, thus doing nothing for Clenbuterol users. There is only one compound that can accomplish this, and that is Ketotifen Fumarate Ketotifen Fumarate is the only thing that will keep beta-2 receptors upregulated. Using legitimate Ketotifen, you can probably get away with using 50% less Clenbuterol than you would otherwise need to if you weren’t using Ketotifen to get the maximum benefits. It is absolutely not a necessity though (I never use Ketotifen with Clen anymore). 4) If You Don't Get The Clen Shakes, It Doesn't Mean Your Product Isn't Bunk This is a myth that is typically pushed by guys who have an agenda of some sort, and may be partly, or entirely responsible for selling somebody (knowingly or unknowingly) bunk Clen. Granted, there are likely some exceptions to the rule, but typically, if your beta-2 receptors aren't completely burnt out, if you can take a moderate dose of Clen and not get the infamous “Clen shakes,” and your resting heart rate isn't notably increased, I would be inclined to believe you got a bunk product. Clenbuterol is one of the drugs where it's blatantly obvious almost every single time if it's real or not within a couple hours of taking it. If I ever got a bottle of Clen where I didn't get shakes from 25-50 mcg (50 being the max wiggle room I'd give a product even if it was underdosed), I'd be highly suspicious of its' potency, or if it even has any active drug in it at all.

    "content": "GH Gut In Bodybuilding – What Causes It?     There is a belief that is widespread in the bodybuilding community that using HGH, MK-677, or other GH releasing peptides will cause your intestines to grow, start protruding outwards, consequently giving a very unaesthetic distended look of the abdominals known as GH gut. Let me put this to rest for you guys.  Table of Contents ToggleIncreased GH Levels Will Not Push Organs Against The StomachThe True Cause Of GH GutWhy Did Bodybuilders From The 70's and 80's Not Have GH Gut?GH Gut Is ReversibleBen Pakulski GH Gut ReversalRoelly Winklaar GH Gut ReversalPhil Heath GH GutIn ConclusionRelated Increased GH Levels Will Not Push Organs Against The Stomach While increased GH levels can cause parts of your body to get bigger (mostly your bones), the amount of GH that it would take to cause your intestines to grow so much that they would be literally pushing your stomach wall outwards is immeasurable. Bones and tendons in the body may grow fairly substantially with extreme dosages of GH, but intestines growing to the point of nearly exploding out of the abdominal wall will not happen.  The True Cause Of GH Gut The cause of GH gut is typically the overconsumption of food, with carbohydrates in particular being the main macronutrient responsible. GH abuse can also indirectly cause GH gut, but the mechanism by which it causes it is much different than what most believe. It isn’t uncommon for a large bodybuilder to be taking in upwards of 1000 grams of carbs per day. Especially when a bodybuilder is trying to gain more size, they need to increase their caloric intake accordingly, which means eating more carbs even after they've already been eating significantly more than the body needs. Keep in mind, caloric needs for the average guy vs caloric needs for a bodybuilder trying to get past 300 pounds lean are significantly different, but the pancreas limits are exactly the same. If you are constantly cranking blood sugar through the roof day in and day out, the pancreas will be stressed in order to produce the amount of insulin necessary to bring blood sugar back to homeostasis, and this is where insulin resistance and pre-diabetic symptoms start to rear their ugly head. When the intestines are backed up with an overabundance of carbohydrates, a backlog of bacteria in the small intestine can develop, and gut health is destroyed while your body attempts to remedy the situation. An overabundance of bacteria in the small intestine leads to significant bloating and gas, and leads to very obvious abdominal distension. Unlike the large intestine (colon), the small intestine does not have a large number of bacteria most of the time. Also, when a bodybuilder over-consumes carbohydrates, they can start becoming insulin resistant, and GH abuse just contributes to this as it will also severely raise blood sugar levels. As insulin resistance sets in and the body has chronically high blood sugar levels, gastric emptying becomes delayed and the intestines start to lose their ability to contract as effectively. Intestinal transit is severely impaired as a result of this.    The gut flora normally would protect the intestine from bacteria. However, if the speed of intestinal transit is negatively affected by chronically high blood sugar levels then backflow from the colon into the small intestine can occur where it becomes colonized with colonic bacteria. This results in bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, and ultimately very obvious “GH Gut”. As insulin resistance becomes worse, intestinal motility is hindered in parallel, just compounding the issue. Why Did Bodybuilders From The 70's and 80's Not Have GH Gut? The reason why bodybuilders from the golden era did not have GH guts comes down to the fact that they didn't have access to GH, and the mass monster era hadn't started yet, so there was no chemical warfare arms race to get as big as humanly possible. As soon as mass monsters started being rewarded circa the Dorian era, there was an obvious need to get bigger. To get bigger you need to eat even more than you already were, meaning you are stressing your pancreas even more than you had to previously to keep your blood sugar in check. The inevitable result that will occur at some stage no matter who the individual is would be abdominal distension once the amount of food overconsumption reaches a point that the digestive system can no longer support, and a backlog of bacteria starts to seep into the intestine where it shouldn't be, which causes bloating/GH gut. We see this time and time again in the modern bodybuilding era as bodybuilders constantly chase size and have to push the boundaries of their digestive health in order to do so. GH Gut Is Reversible Another thing many individuals who preach this myth seem to not take into account is that there have been many successful pro bodybuilders who had a bad showing on stage with gut distension/GH Gut. But then the next time they stepped on stage suddenly their waist was more streamlined, and their gut had magically vanished. Did their organs suddenly shrink and rearrange themselves? No. Their stomach was never protruding from their innards being pushed to the outside, it was simply from their compromised intestinal health causing bloating and distension. Ben Pakulski GH Gut Reversal Ben Pakulski is a great example to use to debunk the intestinal growth theory attributed to GH guts.  As soon as he stopped chasing size and was able to get his gut health in check, he was able to completely reverse his GH gut. If his organs had truly grown, he wouldn't have been able to get rid of it. The truth of the matter is, when chasing extreme levels of size, you will inevitably have to overconsume food and at one point or another likely impair your intestinal health. Ben Pakulski evidently lost some muscle size in between his previous showings where he prominently displayed a massive GH gut and his most recent showing where he had an awesome vacuum pose and no distension issues, and this can be solely attributed to him no longer trying to eat as much food as he would have needed if he wanted to keep gaining size. This is what he was doing previously when he had horrible distension issues, as he was trying to play the size game to remain competitive with the the mass monsters. Roelly Winklaar GH Gut Reversal Roelly is another great example of someone who got their GH gut under control and was able to continue making progress. Was it attributed to his use of a waist trainer? Doubtful. My guess is it had more to do with dietary changes than anything. If you check out Roelly's old showings, you can clearly see he was one of the worst offenders for a prominent GH gut.  But now he can almost hit a vacuum on stage.  A bodybuilder can literally go from having a vacuum to having extreme amounts of distension/GH Gut overnight just by screwing up their carb up and compromising their intestinal health before stepping on stage. This is why you will see bodybuilders show up on stage with huge GH guts, and then a week later show up to another show with the issue completely fixed. Phil Heath GH Gut There are many other cases of GH guts in the bodybuilding world, but Phil Heath's has garnered the most attention of all because of his Olympia wins many felt he didn't deserve. I do not believe Phil Heath's hernia was the cause of his distension issues. It likely played some role on his abdominal control, but the fact remains that his gut has been distended for a few years now, and I believe the root of the issue is compromised intestinal health. I also believe Phil Heath is showing early signs of insulin resistance, also called “Palumboism”. If you compare Phil Heath in 2012 to Phil Heath in 2018, the one glaring difference is his midsection. Whether the result of that is GH abuse, overconsumption of food to chase size to stay on top of the division, or a combination of both, I can't say for certain, but my best guess is that it comes down to those 2 things. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa8LtLUmyeg&t=39s  In Conclusion No, Growth Hormone, MK-677 and peptides will not cause intestinal growth that pushes against the abdominal wall. Poor diet choices, insulin resistance (from GH, your diet, or other causes), and compromised gut health is what will give you extreme bloating and distension (GH gut).

    "date": "2017-03-17T03:12:07+00:00",
    "content": "5 Of The Biggest Myths In Bodybuilding       Myth #1: Your Workout Wasn’t Good If You Aren’t Sore The Next Day Being sore is a side effect of hard training, not a necessity for growth. I could train you into the ground with the goal of making you not even able to walk up your stairs the next day from soreness. But would that induce the most muscle growth possible? Hell no. More is not always better, and training until your legs literally can’t hold you up isn’t a necessity. There is not one piece of research that links post-exercise soreness to muscular hypertrophy, or enhanced strength gains. Being excessively sore is typically a side effect of not being recovered adequately in fact, and may be a sign that you need to increase your protein intake. This doesn’t mean that you are training too hard if you are sore, just don’t make it your priority to train until your muscles are crying and sore as heck. Myth #2: You Need To Do Nothing On Your Rest Days To Recover Optimally No, lying in bed all day and eating 6 times without exerting any energy whatsoever isn’t going to equate to better muscle gains and better recovery. I actually use my rest days as days where I do cardio regardless if bulking or cutting. Stimulating blood flow to your entire body will actually improve your nutrient partitioning, recovery, and obviously maintain cardiovascular health by doing some cardio work on your rest days. Myth #3: Free Weights Are Better For Growth Than Machines This is a huge myth. Yes, free weights will involve stabilization work from other muscles to help lift the weights that won’t necessarily get hit when using machines, however, this shouldn’t make a difference in your muscular development unless you are neglecting those stabilizer muscles and not training them at all in other workouts during the week. The goal of an exercise is to subject your muscle to resistance, to stretch it and contract it, to break down the muscle fibers adequately, and drive blood into the muscle cells. Machines do that just as well as free weights do, but you will simply need to ensure you are hitting those stabilizer muscles still in other targeted exercises. For example, on a flat barbell press you may end up using a lot more front delts and triceps than you would on a machine, however, this may actually take away from your chest development because those stabilization muscles are absorbing some of the workload, whilst on machines you can really focus on the muscle contraction right in your chest because the weight is set on a predetermined track with no stabilization necessary. Myth #4: Forearms And Calves Size Are 100% Genetically Determined While I think they are definitely stubborn muscle groups, if you have small forearms or small calves, don’t give up hope and assume you are doomed to chicken legs or tiny forearms. The main issue with these two muscle groups is that most individuals simply don’t train them enough, or with enough volume. They will do one exercise for each, once per week, and then whine about their crappy genetics. If you have bad forearms, start doing your deadlifts without wrist straps, start doing farmer walks every other day, start doing wrist curls, use fat grips on your bicep exercises, and train them HARD like you want them to grow, and they will respond if you are eating enough as well. Myth #5: Lift Lighter Weight + Higher Reps While Cutting To Tone The Muscle This is a brutal myth. Time and time again, when cutting individuals think that they are “carving” or “striating” their muscles by dropping their weights substantially and increasing their rep ranges. The reality is, you built your current level of muscular development using a certain weight, so do you really think you will adequately maintain muscle tissue in a calorie deficit while cutting by decreasing that work load you are exerting on your muscles? Hell no, you will dwindle away much faster. Your training during a bulk phase should be literally exactly the same as it is while cutting. Obviously as your glycogen stores get depleted and you get leaner you will start to lose some strength and that’s okay, but your goal should be to keep 100% of your strength on every single lift you do at the gym. If you can do that while cutting, you will end up with a much denser physique that retains muscle much easier than you would if you started training much lighter in hopes that you are going to “detail” the muscle.

    "content": "Top 10 Most Complimented Fragrances/Colognes 2017      #10: Reyane Tradition Insurrection Pure II: http://amzn.to/2mhyIpL If you have even scratched the surface of men's fragrances, you probably know by now that the infamous Creed Aventus is regarded by many as the holy grail scent. Insurrection Pure II is essentially just an Aventus clone, smelling nearly 100% identical, for a minuscule fraction of the retail price. Only a fragrance expert would be able to tell the difference if you blindfolded them to be honest.    This fragrance only retails for around $23, meanwhile Aventus is commonly sold for upwards of $300 per bottle. The scent opens with a very apparent pineapple note, and then it drys down into a woody, creamy, and smokey kind of scent. It definitely has some very apparent musk to it as well, which women love. The bottom line, this stuff is pretty much a clone of Aventus, and it garners the same reaction from the ladies Aventus does. Compliments, left right and centre. This scent is best for the Summer in my opinion and hotter temperatures, just like Aventus. It provides a very nice alternative to most standard Summer fragrance choices as well in that it isn't aquatic and just fresh smelling. It is very unique and you will definitely stand out with this one, and it being so cheap as well as smelling exactly like the most highly regarded fragrance on earth (Creed Aventus), it is a no brainer to have a bottle of Insurrection Pure II in your arsenal. #9: Salvatore Ferragamo F Black: http://amzn.to/2bhmPef This one would probably be higher on the list if it were more versatile. This fragrance screams masculinity, and it is the manliest fragrance on this list. It has very obvious notes of Lavender, Tonka Bean, and Black Pepper. It actually smells similar to La Nuit De L’homme except with much more edge, masculinity, and more peppery.  This scent excels best in outdoor situations (particularly, colder weather temperatures) as its’ projection and longevity fall into the beast category. This definitely isn’t a summer fragrance, I find it best for the Fall and Winter months as it is very sophisticated, manly, and can actually cut through the cold air outside and still project to your date or whoever you are with. This cologne is VERY cheap as well. #8: Perry Ellis 360 Red: http://amzn.to/2bIywu3 Or Nautica Voyage http://amzn.to/2by8I7z Another very inexpensive fragrance, 360 Red smells exactly the same as Acqua Di Gio, but it performs much better with greater projection and longevity. So it not only is much cheaper, but it performs better as well.  This scent is super versatile and can be used at work, at school, running errands, on dates, with family, out with friends, it literally is fantastic for almost every single situation. The most noticeable notes from this fragrance are the Lime, Cinnamon and Bergamot, and it is very strong so be careful to not over apply it.  Nautica Voyage is also a fantastic VERY cheap fragrance, and it falls into the exact same category as 360 Red in the sense that it is a great everyday scent that can be used for anything essentially, and is universally pleasing to all who smell it. It is very affordable, with 100 ml only costing around $15. I ALWAYS have a bottle of this in my collection, and if I’m running out I will order another one without question. It is a perfect scent for summer time, the gym (it’s very fresh), or the daytime in general. It has mass appeal with women and it is a very, very safe choice. I have yet to encounter one single person who doesn’t like this fragrance a lot. The performance is good, it is versatile as hell, it is insanely cheap, and all women love it. You can’t go wrong with Nautica Voyage. #7: Armani Code Profumo: http://amzn.to/2mFv8EC This fragrance smells delicious. It has some of the same DNA of the original Armani Code, but definitely has been amped up about 20 notches in the performance category, and smells a lot sweeter. It is a fantastic clubbing fragrance, AKA it can cut through the crowd of other dudes' fragrances very well and brings HORDES of compliments from women.  It is very sexy, sophisticated, and definitely has a few qualities that differentiate it from Armani Code Original in a big way. Armani Code Original almost smells like a fresh out of the shower type fragrance, whereas the Profumo rendition is absolutely not subtle and falls right into the beast category for performance, and best of all, not many guys wear it. You can expect 10+ hours of high performance wear out of a few spritzes of this stuff, it is that strong. #6: Abercrombie & Fitch Fierce: http://amzn.to/2kPeuWX Or Montblanc Legend: http://amzn.to/2lxZYA0 The reason these two both share the #6 spot is that they literally almost smell identical.   Legend is a more cost-effective alternative to Abercrombie & Fitch Fierce, and for years many guys have been buying Legend instead, but some guys swear they can tell a difference between the two. Honestly, I can hardly tell the difference, and they both perform very well. They project strongly, so if you are using it in a date setting it is best to be conservative with the application of either and to just bring a travel atomizer with you if you need reapplication later in the date, but it probably won’t be necessary. The best way to describe these fragrances is that they are pure musk. If you have ever walked into an Abercrombie & Fitch store you most likely have smelled this fragrance, because many of the retail locations are completely filled with this scent in the air. I think back to my teenage high school days when I smell this fragrance, and it is very youthful, playful, and “young sexy” if that makes sense. I don’t think that older men would be able to wear this scent; it is tailored more towards the teenage/very young adult crowd. I held off from buying this scent for a while, but I ended up pulling the trigger last year and was very pleased with the amount of compliments it has brought in. I find that this scent is best for school and dates. #5: Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit De L’homme: http://amzn.to/2bIx3Ux This was my #1 last year, and the only reason it has dropped is simply because the number of compliments it has gotten has been superseded by the other 4 I will mention. This fragrance is still absolutely a masterpiece, eloquently mixing sexiness, masculinity, and softness in one heavenly blend of panty dropping smoothness.  This will absolutely get you tons of compliments on dates and other close-encounter situations, and is still a must have in your collection if you want some variety for your dates. If you only want one scent for your dates, then consider La Nuit De L’homme if the type of fragrance you want isn’t aggressively masculine, but is still extremely sexy. It definitely is the softest of the top date fragrances I have in my list, but it never fails to still be sexy as hell to women. #4: Christian Dior Sauvage: http://amzn.to/2bICLpl As much as the fragrance community loves to hate this fragrance, I can’t deny that it is quickly becoming one of my most complimented fragrances. This fragrance is the definition of “synthetic” smelling, but women still love it, and it excels particularly well in the summer. This is one of my go to fragrances now for running errands, grocery shopping, and almost anything in the summer with the exception of close encounter dates.  The performance of this is arguably stronger than even Armani Code Profumo, and is very powerful, so conservative spraying should always be done with this fragrance. It will literally project across the room and last for 10-12+ hours at close to full strength even with moderate application. Definitely don’t overdo it with this one or it will be very cloying. However, conservatively applied when you are out and about in the spring/summer heat, you will get tons of compliments from women with it. This one is definitely blind buy worthy because even if you go to the store to smell it first, you will probably not like it very much. I assure you, despite what your opinion of this might be (I don’t think it smells outstanding either), women LOVE it. #3: The One EDP By Dolce and Gabbana: http://amzn.to/2moglSN This absolute masterpiece is simply the Eau De Parfum concentration version of the EDT version of The One. We lucked out and they actually nailed the scent and maintained its’ integrity, while doing exactly what we hoped with this one, and that was to simply make it stronger but still smell the same. This sexy fragrance has a very obvious boozy, tobacco note in it that makes it smell very sophisticated, and the overall scent is just incredibly sexy too. If you were to only buy 1 fragrance that would universally please the nose of everyone who smells it, this would probably be the safest buy for you.  This fragrance is the definition of a panty dropper, and is exceptional for dates, as well as pretty much any nighttime situation in my opinion. I feel it excels more in colder temperatures, but it can honestly be used year round and is very versatile. This fragrance will have women burying their noses in your chest (and other places) to inhale this scent (seriously it is that good). #2: Carolina Herrera CH Men: https://amzn.to/2CELw1I CH Men is still my personal favorite fragrance in my collection. It has blatant whiskey and leather notes, and those make the fragrance very masculine and almost smell like a bad boy type sexy.  It’s hard to put into words, but it is extremely alluring, classy, but still has an obvious edge to it. It also has a bit of a playful vibe to it due to the evident sweetness in the scent. I find this fragrance excels most in the evening during indoor dates and get-togethers, although it is still pretty versatile. #1: Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb: http://amzn.to/2lNUh39 This new addition to my lineup was a VERY surprising underdog in the compliments department (or at least I thought it was an underdog). I bought this scent at the beginning of last Fall because I wanted something “spicier” for the Fall and Winter seasons. I knew of this fragrance but never pulled the trigger on it, and one day I was at a store in the mall smelling a variety of fragrances and pulled out a sample of Spicebomb. It was the first time I got a 10/10 rating on a fragrance from a very critical woman who has literally smelled every fragrance I own and not rated any of them more than a 9/10.  After I bought this, I noticed an enormous response in compliments, which was actually much to my surprise as I didn’t think this fragrance was going to break the top 5, but it really does deserve its’ placing. The performance is great, it isn’t a beast, but it doesn’t require over application to project adequately and it lasts for a very long time. I can still smell this fragrance on my sweaters weeks later. I also find that this fragrance coincides exceptionally with the tastes of women during the Fall and Winter months. During these times Women are going to Starbucks and getting their Pumpkin Spice lattes, buying spiced scented body lotion and soaps, and Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb is literally the epitome of sexy, masculine, Fall/Winter spices. The name of the fragrance is absolutely fitting. It encompasses the scents that Women find intoxicating during these months and blends it into a sensual, masculine, powerhouse fragrance that is irresistible. I have yet to find one woman who doesn’t like this fragrance, and it scores compliments all across the board. The best part about it is it is so versatile that it can be used very almost every single situation. Dates, clubbing, get-togethers, errands, school, work, literally any situation essentially this fragrance is an absolute masterpiece.

    "content": "The #1 Secret To Never Running Out Of Things To Say To Girls     The biggest reason why guys are so terrified of hitting on women is the fear of running out of things to say, and not knowing what to say to a woman.  Have you ever been out at the bar or a club and seen some hottie in a guys arms and he’s just chatting up a storm with her and you want to know SO BADLY what this guy could possibly be talking about that has her so invested in him (I know you have). “If only I knew what these guys were saying! Then I would have the keys to getting gorgeous women left right and center” is what I used to tell myself. Well guys, I figured it out. And you may be shocked when you find out what they are really talking about. These guys that are scoring with all these hotties you have been unnecessarily pedestaling all these years are literally talking about WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT. I’m serious, in a bar or club you can’t even hear what you’re saying half the time, do you think she can hear you clearly? Nope. As long as you can maintain a fluid conversation by at least in some decent capacity answering what she’s talking about, have words that come out of your mouth that are relevant to what she’s talking about, and can follow up with a topic about literally anything, you can seriously have an endless conversation. The same applies during day game (approaches in the day time). For your first approaches, after introducing yourself, you should literally just say the first thing that comes to your mind and go from there. You will be shocked at how quickly you develop when you force your mind to think on the fly. Why Analyzing “Players” Conversations Is Harmful To Your Development When I was first writing this article, I was going to include some sample conversations I have had with women because I know when I was learning I loved specifics and real in field examples that I could see from start to finish EXACTLY what a successful conversation looked like. However, after literally writing out a few conversations I have had for your reference, I realized it would be far more beneficial to completely avoid including specifics about exactly what I say. The reason for this is simple. If you spend time reading and analyzing what other people say, you will start to develop a very one-track state of mind where when you are at a loss for words, the only thing you can muster up in your head is canned material that you have read or heard online. This is a huge issue for guys because if you go into approaches to hit on women with predetermined material or stories or a script essentially, you have already screwed yourself over for your development. Winging It Vs. Having A Script If you are hitting on women using scripts, you will eventually become so accustomed to only having the conversation pieces from your script as material, that you will never progress and adapt to situations where your own creative mind would kick in and give you things to say. This is what happened to me, I used to go out with predetermined conversation topics in my head, and then when I got into conversations it felt SO unnatural, not congruent with my personality, and I didn’t get better at talking to women at all because I was just rehearsing written material that didn’t allow my brain to progress in any creative way. I didn’t get sharper, I didn’t get more clever, I just stayed the same and rehearsed the same old bullshit over and over. How I Started Making Progress At A VERY Fast Rate My true progress started at an exponentially fast rate when I ditched the scripted material completely, and went into conversations having absolutely no idea what I was going to say beforehand. The first several conversations are definitely awkward as you run out of stuff to say, but this is where progress is made insanely quick, because your brain quickly adapts and you start to learn how to come up with witty topics, responses, and just great overall conversational skills ON THE FLY. This not only is immeasurably beneficial for your success with women, but it translates directly into other facets of your life like job interviews, stressful business presentations, going to parties with strangers and not knowing anyone, etc. Think of having a conversation with your best friend and how not awkward it is. Women are just human beings, flesh and bones, just like your best friend is, and you should treat conversations with them no differently, because they aren’t any different than any other human being. Seriously, I could start talking about literally anything and turn that into a 20 minute conversation. I could ask where she’s from, and then when she answers your creative brain could kick in if you know the place she’s talking about and then have a multitude of questions and subtopics from there related to the place she’s from and turn that into a giant conversation. Or you could turn that into a subtopic about travelling, and where she’s been in the world. Or you could turn it into a conversation about where you’re from and an interesting fact about where you’re from, or literally fucking anything. You could even just randomly blurt out “what’s your favorite sexual position?” mid conversation and she would more likely than not be stoked to find a guy who’s ballsy enough to bring that up as it’s not just another boring conversation topic for her, and then you could have an awesome conversation about sex and escalate that into taking her home with you. The reason why it’s so difficult to find information online about what exactly to say to get into a woman’s pants is that there is no formula, you simply talk, and make sure your intent is known via non-verbal body language, or giving her a compliment, or anything that lets her know you don’t just want to be friends without literally having to say it. Or you could even say it if you felt like it. There are no rules! Think about how ridiculous it is to be scared to talk to a little 110 pound human; it’s almost laughable when you truly think about it. Ultimately, the goal of every conversation with a woman is to finish off with bringing them home with you if your logistics are worked out, or to get their phone number so you can set up a date with them at another time and place. You absolutely don’t need to have an hour-long conversation with a woman, or even a ten-minute one for that matter. You could literally even grab a girl’s number on the way out of a venue by going up to her quickly and dropping a compliment (not mandatory but I typically do it so they know my intent), introducing yourself, and telling her you want to grab her number so you can connect another time, and then handing her your phone to put her number into it. That interaction would literally take no more than 30 seconds and it works like a charm. To Sum It All Up + Best Topics To Bring Up If You Completely Blank If you can’t think of something to say, literally say the first thing that pops into your head and base your conversation off that. Even if it’s kind of odd, by forcing yourself into situations where you have to come up with a conversation off the top of your head, you will start to develop your “game” at incredibly fast rate (faster than any other method in my opinion), and soon you will find yourself easily having smooth conversations with women that can last as long or as short as you want them to with absolutely no awkward pauses. If you legitimately blank out during a conversation and are freaking out, then just throw a random general question at the girl like “what do you do for work?” or any general question that will get her talking while you regain your composure, and then you can branch off of her response from there with an array of different responses or sub-topics relevant to her work. Easy general topics that you can bring up when you blank are work, school, hobbies, travel, and future aspirations. These each on their own could span into hour long conversations and sub-topics, so I compel you to use these if you legitimately blank or need to regain your composure. It’s not rocket science guys, and you will soon find after doing this consistently that each conversation becomes easier, and easier, and easier, until you are so calm cool and collected that talking to a random attractive woman you don’t know is as easy as talking to your best friend.

    "content": "How Attractive Do You Need To Be To Get Good Looking Women     Issues With Self Entitlement Delving into this article and my stance on women’s sexuality these days, I should preface this entire article with the statement “she has probably slept with someone uglier than you.” What do I mean by this exactly? Well, many men not only have massive issues with self-esteem, and overall feelings of insecurity, but they also suffer from a major pitfall that literally sewers their dating lives. That issue is a lack of entitlement. Entitlement is defined as “the fact of having a right to something.” This article isn’t referring to men being entitled to women in general, but it’s referring to the fact that many men don’t feel like they are worth enough, or entitled to having intimacy with an attractive woman. This lack of self-entitlement prevents them from EVER fulfilling their potential, and they live in a state of underachieving for the vast majority of their lives (unless they do something about it). On any given day or night, there are hundreds of attractive women in a small vicinity of you, and in the span of their lives they have likely slept with a handful of men at least, but more than likely that number is higher for the majority, and for some the number is significantly higher.  Your lack of action is the only thing stopping you from scoring with these women. I have known several 19-21 year old girls who have lay counts in the 10-15+ range. Now, think logically for a moment. Do you really think of those men, every single one of those was significantly better looking than you are? No, the chances are very unlikely. As a matter of fact, it would be more plausible to assume that at least one of those men was significantly WORSE looking than you are. How Did HE Get A Girl Like THAT? This is likely a question you have asked yourself at least once (more likely several) in your life. Seeing a guy who’s far below your level of attractiveness walking around with a hottie on his arm. What am I getting at with all of this? There is a minimum standard that must be met looks wise (referred to as the looks threshold by Chris at GoodLookingLoser.com), and this minimum standard varies from girl to girl. You will note a typical progression of women as they age. At a young age they are usually more interested in attractive guys.  Having a beater car and living in your parent’s basement isn’t even an issue to a 19-year-old girl if you are attractive to them. As women start to age, and get closer to their mid twenties, looks become far less important than they were in their teen years and very early twenties, and things like money, status, ability to be a good provider, etc. become more important, and by the time they’re in their late twenties the concept of looks being the most important thing is completely laughable. Hell, I even heard a woman the other day in her thirties say she “just wants a guy taller than her with a good job who isn’t bald.” That was the extent of her requirements. It’s blatantly obvious that this misconception of attractive women only wanting guys with movie star good looks is just a manifestation of men’s own insecurities. You Just Need To Be Above Average The older you get, the less important looks become relative to all other factors. However, even when you are young, you’d be shocked at how viable of a sexual partner you are to many women who you probably think are “out of your league.” Through my success with women, a lot of naysayers like to tell me that my judgment is clouded based on my physique and that’s the reason why I did so well with women. Granted, as my looks improved, I matured, gained muscle, became more comfortable talking to women, etc. my results did improve along with it, however, the truth is, I started exactly where many of you guys are. I was a skinny little beanpole who didn’t have a lot of things going for me other than the fact that I was relatively tall and was in shape.  And, even at that time with my very ordinary looks, and only being above average in my age group (I was tall, dressed nicely when I went out, and was fit) I still did well with very attractive women. This is because I made an effort to actually try. The issue with men is THEY DO NOT TRY. If you think that going out at night and drinking a half liter of vodka so you can have the confidence to drunkenly walk up to a girl on the dance floor and creepily start grinding on her while she dances and hope to turn that into a lay later in the night is the only way you can get laid (what 90% of other guys my age did) you are sorely mistaken. My friends would literally sit there astonished when they’d see me have the audacity to go walk up to an attractive woman in the grocery store, at the mall, on the street, anywhere, and strike up a quick conversation, hit on her, and get her number. The reason is because this behaviour is so rare, and frankly, nobody has the balls to do it. Since when did being a man, talking to someone and being friendly become so bizarre? Societal programming is the culprit, but that’s another topic for another time. If you are above average, meet that particular girl’s looks threshold who you are hitting on, and she is open to having someone new in her dating/sex life, you will more than likely leave that situation with a new very promising prospect for your own dating/sex life, or even have her in your bed in the next 20 minutes if you are seasoned at this and have worked out your logistics beforehand. Women's State Of Being Sexually Open Assuming you are taking action and actively hitting on women, as well as look better than the average guy, you are golden. Let’s delve into being sexually open very briefly before closing off this topic. When a woman rejects you, assuming that you have met a set of predetermined criteria, you are not getting rejected for not being handsome enough, or not having witty enough pickup lines, or not being smooth enough, rather, you are rejected simply because she is not open to having someone new in her sex life at that particular moment, and that same outcome would inevitably happen at that time if any other guy meeting that criteria went up to her and hit on her too. If she is young that criteria is usually simply that you meet her specific looks threshold. It doesn’t take a genius to ask a girl what her name is, how her day is going, what she does for work, say we should grab a drink/coffee/whatever the hell you want, etc. These are literally the extent of how your conversation skills need to go to get the number of a girl who you’ve just met if you’ve met the looks threshold. So What Does It Really Mean If You Get Rejected? It could mean an infinite amount of things, but of those things, it absolutely is not that you weren’t good looking enough (if you meet her looks threshold). There are many things out of your control that influence a girl’s mindset, and if you get rejected on any given day, the true reason could be:  She has a boyfriend She just lost her job Someone in her family died She’s having a bad day She is obsessed with some other guy She has depression She’s fighting with her friends She’s failing in school She’s a weirdo She works three jobs and doesn’t have time to date  Or a million other reasons that are COMPLETELY outside of your control.  I’ve hit on girls who have flat out rejected me contact me out of the blue a year later wanting to meet up. The reason for this is that although I met their minimum requirements, they weren’t at that exact moment and time open to having someone new in their life. When I connected with them the next time, they were. Yes, girls have lives too, and events in their lives influence what they are currently in that exact moment and time available and wanting to do or not to do. And if you just so happen to get rejected (you will many times), don’t sweat it. Seriously. There are countless factors outside of your control that can (and will) ultimately influence her decision and none of them are dependent on your looks or your game if you meet her minimum looks requirements. This is why when you ask for a “player’s” batting average/lay ratio, if they aren’t lying, even the best looking ones will typically at most sleep with 5-9% of the women they hit on. 9% is actually a VERY good ratio, and is probably even a bit generous. Most women are simply not available for one reason or another during that exact moment and time when they are being hit on, and that’s the cold hard truth. This isn’t something to fret about though, as the men who take action are the ones who know the truth, and understand that this entire dating scene is just a big numbers game. Aka the more volume you put in (the more women you hit on), the more notches you will get on your belt (sexual encounters). So, What Does It Take To Sleep With Attractive Women Consistently? The point of this article isn’t to convince you that you can avoid putting in work improving your looks and still nail supermodels on a weekly basis. No, absolutely not. However, the point of this article is that you should do everything in your power to max out your current looks, and when you do that, even if you are still just above average (not very hard to achieve with some commitment), you will still be capable of getting very attractive women because you will be meeting most of their minimum requirements from a looks standpoint. These things include but are not limited to:  Improving your wardrobe Having good hygiene Hitting the gym (being jacked isn’t necessary, just fit and a low body fat % is far more important) Proper diet Hair Loss Prevention  Once you have at least become fit, have maxed out your wardrobe, have good hygiene, you have more than likely reached a level that is above the average for men at your age. Once you have reached the general looks threshold, all it takes from there is action, which every one else is severely lacking. Don’t follow the norm. If you want something, go out there and get it. Simple as that.

    "content": "High Dose MK-677 Vs. Low Dose MK-677 Results     This article will delve into exactly what you can expect from high dose MK-677 vs low dose MK-677, and how that will correlate to your individually specific goals. Referring to the following study we can see what HGH/IGF-1 level response is to a relatively low dose of MK-677 (10 mg per day), as well as what the response is to a high dose of MK-677 (50 mg per day). Oral administration of growth hormone (GH) releasing peptide-mimetic MK-677 stimulates the GH/insulin-like growth factor-I axis in selected GH-deficient adults. Read the following results from this study carefully: “After treatment with 10 mg MK-677, IGF-1 concentrations increased 52 +/- 20% (65 +/- 6 to 99 +/- 9 micrograms/L, geometric mean +/- intrasubject SE, P < or = 0.05 vs. baseline), and 24 h mean GH concentrations increased 79 +/- 19% (0.14 +/- 0.01 to 0.26 +/- 0.02 microgram/L, P < or = 0.05 vs. baseline). Following treatment with 50 mg MK-677, IGF-1 concentrations increased 79 +/- 9% (84 +/- 3 to 150 +/- 6 micrograms/L, P < or = 0.05 vs. baseline) and 24-h mean GH concentrations increased 82 +/- 29% (0.21 +/- 0.02 to 0.39 +/- 0.04 microgram/L, P < or = 0.05 vs. baseline), respectively. Serum IGF binding protein-3 concentrations increased with both 10 mg (1.2 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/L, P < or = 0.05) and 50 mg MK-677 (1.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.2 +/- 0.2 micrograms/L, P < or = 0.05).” While there are a lot of random numbers thrown around that may seem confusing, there is one very apparent factor that becomes obvious. The 50 mg dose of MK-677 resulted in a significantly higher IGF-1 level increase than 10 mg of MK-677 did, but an almost equivalent increase in GH concentrations. Placebo Vs 10mg MK-677 Vs 50mg MK-677 in GH deficient men – GH Levels Placebo Vs 10mg MK-677 Vs 50mg MK-677 in GH deficient men – IGF-1 Levels 10 mg MK-677 increased serum IGF-1 levels by 52% on average, and increased GH levels by 79% on average. 50 mg MK-677 increased serum IGF-1 levels by 79% on average, and increased GH levels by 82% on average. What we can conclude from this is that 50 mg doesn’t result in much higher GH concentrations than 10 mg does, but it did result in significantly higher IGF-1 concentrations. So you might still be sitting there wondering what that really means in terms of which dose you should be doing your own research with. The answer to that lies in the difference between the function of high GH levels and high IGF-1 levels. In general, high GH levels typically equate to more fat loss, anti-aging and healing, whilst high IGF-1 levels equate to more muscle growth. For a more comprehensive and complete list of the benefits of HGH vs. IGF-1, please refer to my original MK-677 article. Based on the study, if fat loss and the anti-aging/healing benefits of HGH is all that is sought after by the user, a 10 mg dose would likely be sufficient. Whereas if the user was seeking maximized muscle growth potential, then higher IGF-1 levels would be what they are after, and would then justify a higher dosing protocol. While this study did compare 50 mg and 10 mg dosing, delving further into other studies you will note that there is a significant diminishing returns effect on IGF-1 levels once you hit a dosage of 25 mg per day. You can still get almost all of the increase in IGF-1 concentration with 25 mg that 50 mg would produce. Hence, 50 mg is unnecessarily high to research with, and 25 mg is the benchmark for boosting IGF-1 levels significantly higher, while still reaping all of the benefits of the GH increase. Keep this in mind when designing your protocol as the optimal dosage will be different based upon your specific individual goals.

    "content": "MK-677 Doesn’t Cause Hypoglycemia – Reactive Hypoglycemia Explained     MK-677 DOES NOT Directly Cause Hypoglycemia I can see how many individuals would conclude that MK-677 is causing hypoglycemia, because it literally brings on the exact same feeling that very low blood sugar brings on. Shakiness, sweating, severe hunger, anxiety, etc. The thing is, with MK-677 is it doesn’t drop your blood sugar; rather, it slightly increases it. MK-677 is most commonly known as a potent growth hormone secretagogue. However, one commonly overlooked trait of MK-677 is the fact that it is an oral ghrelin mimetic. What Is Ghrelin Exactly? Ghrelin is also known as the “hunger hormone.” It is a peptide that is secreted by your stomach that stimulates your appetite. When your stomach is empty, Ghrelin is produced to signal to your brain that you are hungry and need to eat. As you would expect, Ghrelin levels are high before meals, and low after finishing meals. This is how your body regulates its appetite and knows when to eat and when to stop eating. Growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRP’s) and growth hormone secretagogues (like MK-677) function by stimulating the pituitary gland to pulse out GH. These GHRP’s and MK-677 also have a very significant effect on Ghrelin. The most notable being GHRP-6 and MK-677. These are both notorious as appetite stimulating compounds. Their ability to stimulate appetite so significantly has nothing to do with them dropping your blood sugar lower and making you hungrier, rather, it has to do with the fact that they significantly increase Ghrelin levels more than any of the other GHRP’s. The result of this is a massive spike in hunger, resembling the symptoms very closely of hypoglycemia. The effect on blood sugar levels is actually completely contradictory to what most are thinking is occurring in their body. In one of the most popular and notable studies on MK-677, you will find that they actually observed its’ effect on blood sugar levels in the body after continuous use, and it was determined that “Fasting blood glucose level increased an average of 0.3 mmol/L (5 mg/dL) in the MK-677 group (P = 0.015), and insulin sensitivity decreased.” You can read this study for yourself here: Effects of an oral ghrelin mimetic on body composition and clinical outcomes in healthy older adults: a randomized trial. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18981485 The point of me addressing this is more so to dispel a common myth surrounding MK-677, as well as to inform you about how it actually is working in your body and the mechanism of action behind the hunger response. Can MK-677 Indirectly Cause Hypoglycemia? Yes, and this is something a lot of people don't understand either. If you are experiencing Hypoglycemia on MK-677, this is the result of your own body's poor insulin response. As mentioned, MK-677 can raise blood sugar. But, in some individuals with developing insulin resistance, when their body senses a spike in blood sugar, their pancreas releases too much insulin. Not enough to just bring blood sugar to homeostasis, but so much as to cause a complete reversal of blood sugar and drop it low. The final outcome of that is a tanked blood sugar reading, and very real hypoglycemia. Early stage or moderate insulin resistance combined with a growth hormone secretagogue that increases blood sugar levels would just worsen the condition and inch you closer to becoming diabetic. The only way to fix this is to address the insulin resistance and work on improving fasting blood sugar via lifestyle and diet changes. The overconsumption of carbohydrates (and calories in general) and lack of exercise are the most common causes of reactive hypoglycemia and insulin resistance. Growth Hormone abuse is also another common cause in bodybuilders. How Can You Tell If You Are Experiencing Hypoglycemia Or Just A Giant Ghrelin Spike? The only way to be 100% sure is to take your blood sugar and see for yourself. Some individuals are unable to discern between a huge Ghrelin spike, and crashing blood sugar, so it would be advised that you keep a glucose meter on hand whenever you mess around with MK-677, GH, or anything that can cause a sharp elevation or sharp drop in blood sugar. The solution if your blood sugar drops would be to quickly ingest something with simple sugars that will quickly raise your blood sugar back up to normal. The solution to help reverse insulin resistance would be to exercise, clean up your diet and focus on losing fat, get adequate sleep every night, as well as remove any drugs out of your protocol that are keeping your blood glucose levels chronically elevated.

    "content": "How To Give A Girl A Mind Blowing Orgasm – Hitachi Magic Wand Review     My Hitachi Magic Wand Review This Magic Wand review is positive to be frank, very very positive. You could blind buy this vibrator without even reading this article and you would not be disappointed. With that being said, every girl is different and has different sexual preferences. Some things that make one girl go over the moon with pleasure could leave another girl yawning. However, there is one sure fire way to send 99.9% of women into a state of delirious pleasure, and more than likely give them the most intense “O” they have ever experienced in their entire lives. That Sure Fire Way Is “The Hitachi Magic Wand”  Obviously there are various techniques you can use yourself, but in this article I'm going to delve into this device in particular as I have found it to be extraordinary in its' ability to deliver amazing levels of pleasure to your lucky lady. I'm not exaggerating when I say that even women who have never experienced an orgasm before in their lives will probably still get off from the Magic Wand. What Is “The Hitachi Magic Wand?” It commonly goes by a few names. These include “Magic Wand,” “Hitachi Magic Wand,” “The Magic Wand Original,” and “Magic Wand®”. The Magic Wand was originally created as a body massager, and it worked great to work out the knots and kinks in the body. Eventually, its’ “uses” evolved to a point where it is now almost exclusively known as a sex toy. It is unparalleled in its’ ability to bring on near-instant arousal and consistent, multiple orgasms to whichever lucky lady is using it.  It has two speeds, a low and a high setting (5,000 and 6,000 vibrations per minute, respectively), allowing for customization over the intensity. Those who are more sensitive will typically be most comfortable using the low setting. It is definitely not a coincidence that in most adult films where the woman is trying to get off and there is a toy involved; 9/10 times the toy is the Magic Wand. Needless to say it is the only vibrator you will ever need to use with your girl, and if she has one already, this one will blow it away. If You Just Came Here To Buy A Hitachi Magic Wand: You can use the following priority links to order from one of the only official “Original Magic Wand” distributors in the world: For customers in the USA buy your Magic Wand here: PinkCherry.com (free shipping will automatically be applied to your order when you use this order link) For customers in Canada buy your Magic Wand here: PinkCherry.ca (free shipping will automatically be applied to your order when you use this order link) For International customers buy your Magic Wand here: AdamEve.com (free shipping will be applied to your order when you use the following code “59SHIP” at checkout) There are many fakes and imitations being sold all over the internet, but be aware that there are only a few legitimate Magic Wand vendors online. The approved distributor I used for mine is linked above.  Real Hitachi Magic Wand Reviews (There Are Literally Hundreds You Can Easily Find Online)        I literally pulled these reviews all in a matter of 30 seconds off of the distributor reviews page. That's how many over the top positive ones there are. There are hundreds of Hitachi Magic Wand reviews online, and I compel you to check for yourself just how positive the feedback is on this device. What Can You And Your Special Lady Expect From The Magic Wand? Without delving into too much graphic detail, you can expect to give your girl one of the most intensely pleasurable experiences of her life. I’m actually quite surprised how few women have actually heard of this thing, and I’m positive if they all knew what this device was capable of, they would all own one themselves. All the reasons why a vibrator is pleasurable for a woman are applicable for the Magic Wand, except they are exponentially magnified to catastrophic proportions. That is the best way I can describe just how powerful this device is. The Original Magic Wand Vs. The Magic Wand Rechargeable There are two legitimate Magic Wand products available now, one being “The Original Magic Wand” and the other being “The Magic Wand Rechargeable”.  The only difference between the two is that one plugs into the wall, and the rechargeable one operates off of a battery so it doesn’t need to be plugged in to use. However, the rechargeable model is about 2x as expensive as the plug in model. My suggestion is to not even think about it and go with the plug in model. It is far cheaper, it doesn’t require charging consistently, and the cord that plugs into the wall is actually long enough that it not reaching where you need it to is typically not an issue (the cord is 6 feet long). The Hitachi Magic Wand Vs. Other Vibrators Comparing the Magic Wand to other vibrators is like comparing a Lamborghini to a Honda. There is no comparison. The Magic Wand was actually originally marketed as a body massager, used to work out knots and kinks in different muscle groups. It wasn’t until users started to be a bit adventurous with their use of this device that it became known that it was essentially a plug in pleasure machine. Comparing it to other vibrators would be pointless as this literally stands in a class of its’ own in power and performance. That cheap looking plastic vibrator at your local grocery store, or even the “top of the line” vibrators at your local sex shop will literally pale in comparison to the Magic Wand. 1 Year Warranty When you buy a Magic Wand Original from a legitimate distributor, you will automatically be eligible for a 1-year warranty. This is only applicable for legitimate vendors of the Magic Wand though, so if you buy a cheap knockoff and it breaks, you will not be able to get your Wand replaced free of charge, or be covered by the warranty at all. Fake Magic Wand Sellers There are hordes of websites and retailers selling brand name imitations and knockoff products, and naturally, the best will always be imitated. This has led to a large influx of fake Magic Wand products into the sex toy industry. Especially on places like Amazon and Ebay. While it may seem overwhelming figuring out if the retailer you’re using is selling an official product or not, do yourself a favour and simply order straight from one of the few legitimate vendors. Where To Buy A Legitimate Magic Wand  There are only a handful of legitimate official “Magic Wand Original” vendors in the world, and I have linked the one I personally used below: For customers in the USA PinkCherry.com has the best deal on the Original Magic Wand for customers living in the USA. Free shipping will automatically be applied to your order when you use the following More Plates More Dates order link: ORDER HERE For customers in Canada PinkCherry.ca has the best deal on the Original Magic Wand for customers living in Canada. Free shipping will automatically be applied to your order when you use the following More Plates More Dates order link: ORDER HERE For International customers AdamEve.com has the best deal on the Original Magic Wand for International customers. Free shipping will be applied to your order when you use the following code “59SHIP” at checkout. You can order via the More Plates More Dates order link here: ORDER HERE By using any of these links, you are ensuring you are getting a 100% authentic Magic Wand product, straight from an approved seller. Don’t risk getting a fake product just because you saw a cheaper price somewhere else. If it looks to good to be true and is cheaper than most sellers, it is probably a fake. Magic Wand Discreet Packaging I know the first concern many guys have who live with their family ordering these devices is wondering if a box will show up with sex-related images plastered all over it.  Ease your mind; your sexual activities will remain a secret as the box it shows up in is packaged very discreetly without any images or text that could suggest the contents.  Even the shipping documents and the invoice in the packaging are discreet. In Conclusion This article was simply a very general overview of this amazing device, and there is a lot that could be said about this product. For now though, checkout the Magic Wand, I think you will find that it speaks for itself, and if you have any questions feel free to drop a comment below.

    "date": "2017-01-18T19:38:44+00:00",
    "content": "The Number 1 Thing That Determines How Much Muscle You Can Gain     There is 1 thing above all other factors that determines if you can put muscle on at all, how much you can put on and at what rate.  It's not steroids, or training, or sleep…. It's Food  The sad thing is that most will be quite disappointed with this boring if an answer, but it is in fact the 100% cold hard truth. Many people have gotten into the fad of calorie counting for cutting and then don't understand why they aren't growing when they're trying to gain muscle. If your body expends more calories than you're taking in per day, all of that food you ate has been burned off to fuel your everyday activities. None of it has gone into building muscle tissue or gaining weight. The only way you gain muscle is by eating a calorie surplus, where there is an excess amount of calories that goes towards facilitating muscle growth. I can't stress enough how important eating a calorie surplus per day is for gaining muscle. Even if you're on thousands of milligrams of anabolic steroids per week, you simply will not grow if you're not eating a calorie surplus. This is why it is so important that when you pick a goal, it doesn't conflict with another goal. I also consider this the two steps forward one step back methodology, a common practice in bodybuilding where an individual tries to accomplish two totally separate and contradicting goals like gaining muscle and losing fat simultaneously. The end result is spinning your wheels, and making crappy overall progress. Sometimes people will under eat to stay lean, but also want to put on muscle at the same time and gain huge amounts of size.  It simply will not happen. You should either be gaining muscle and minimizing fat gain eating in a calorie surplus, or losing fat and minimizing muscle loss eating in a calorie deficit. It would be wise to pick one goal or the other when you are writing out your diet plan. The plan of attack you create for yourself should always be driven by 1 overarching main goal. Do you want to gain muscle or get ripped more? Which is more of a priority for you at this exact moment in your life? PICK ONE, NOT BOTH Throw the concept of burning fat and building muscle simultaneously out the window because even if you could accomplish that, your results would be subpar. It doesn't matter if you have testosterone levels through the roof and take 10 iu's of HGH per day. If you aren't eating enough food, you won't grow. Sure you can get into semantics and argue that you can grow in a calorie deficit while on performance enhancing drugs, but trust me when I tell you that it is a far cry from how much you could actually grow eating in a caloric surplus on those same compounds, consequently just wasting your health and money to spin your wheels and make subpar progress. I know for me personally, once my calorie intake goes below maintenance, all that matters at that point is muscular maintenance, and everything else goes out the window. There will be no strength or size gains being made, even on performance enhancing drugs, the name of the game becomes simply trying to maintain all my current lean tissue and strength. That is why I stress calorie counting so much, especially for newbies. It's not just something that is optimal to do when you're trying to get shredded. The opposite approach to calorie manipulation should still be taken while bulking. I tell guys this time and time again, “the most anabolic thing you can take is FOOD.” Instead of slowly tapering down calories and tapering up cardio like you would to lose fat, you should slowly taper calories up and taper down cardio to gain muscle. All your body mass is essentially just stored calories, whether it be stored muscle proteins in the form of lean muscle mass, or in the form of spilled over carbohydrates stored as adipose tissue/fat sitting on your stomach, your body is a walking embodiment of the food you have ate. Anabolic compounds are simply hormones that allow your body to make more efficient use of nutrients that are ingested into your body, but the hormones themselves won't do jack for gaining muscle in the absence of enough food to grow. If you just shot thousands of dollars of drugs week to week but you eat like a bird, do you really think that the amount of food a canary eats (exaggeration but you get the point) is going to translate into inches of meat being slapped onto your arms, chest, back, legs, etc.? Of course not. I honestly believe that appetite is one of the top limiting factors of a bodybuilder's development. Once you get to a certain point of muscular development, you will likely encounter a point where your metabolism has sped up to such a pace that you simply can no longer eat more on a daily basis than your body expends, and that plateau that many individuals hit is ultimately what will hinder their potential as a bodybuilder. If you can't eat, you can't grow, period. While genetic inserts, muscle bellies, genetic response to performance enhancing drugs, symmetry, shape, etc. are all pivotal determining factors in how far a bodybuilder can go in their development, being consistent in eating like an animal is usually the breaking point for most top tier bodybuilders' development. Your current structure may not be the prettiest, or it may be, but you can always get bigger. There isn't a genetic cap on your size, the cap is a fictional plateau placed on one's own where they truly believe they cannot get bigger, but the reality is, they simply cannot eat enough to get bigger. If I had an insatiable appetite, had hundreds of thousands of dollars of disposable income for performance enhancing drugs, had all the free time in the world to cook and eat like clockwork, and had the motivation to do so, I could probably be a pro bodybuilder within a few years. Granted, my genetic structure isn't blessed enough for me to be a good pro by any means, but the point I'm trying to make is that drugs, training, all of that is all secondary to the importance of eating like a machine. I have no aspirations of being a competitive bodybuilder anymore, and one of the main reasons for that is because my appetite sucks, and I simply don't want to commit myself to the round the clock schedule that would be necessary to undertake for years on end to get to that top level. I truly believe most people are simply in a complete delusional state about their actual potential. The Formula For Becoming A Jacked Bodybuilder: In my honest opinion, the formula for becoming a larger than life bodybuilder is simply the following: Train hard consistently + enough disposable income to spend on performance enhancing drugs and food + the appetite/ability to eat an absurd amount of food = unmeasurable potential Obviously drugs play a big role in bodybuilding, but the same rules apply for natural competitors as well. You aren't growing? Eat a couple hundred more calories per day than you have been. Then watch as the scale starts going up again and your measurements start to get bigger. Rinse and repeat each time you plateau.  It's not rocket science, yet thousands of people are stumped as to why they aren't growing anymore. Obviously there are some intricacies and rare situations where it isn't this cut and dry, but 99% of the time, if you aren't gaining the size you want to be, it is either because of your hormones, or more often a lack of food intake that is limiting your gains.

    "content": "My Phenibut Review – What You Can Expect And What It Feels Like     With over 7 years of experience, I can confidently say that Phenibut is bar none the greatest pro-social supplement ever created. Most Phenibut reviews online are written by affiliate marketers who just want you to use their link to buy Phenibut, but have ZERO real world experience with it in anxiety spiking social situations. If you aren't one of the few men who actually has a sh*t ton of real world experience and a set of balls to go out there and experiment with Phenibut in high pressure situations like first dates, cold approach, job interviews and business presentations, your Phenibut review is useless in my opinion. To be clear, Phenibut is not something you should use to get high or feel happy, this is a tool you should strategically reserve for social situations that make you anxious. My experience ranges from micro-dosing Phenibut all the way to falling asleep in a club with a girl on my arm with over 5 grams of Phenibut in my system (p.s. once you induce Phenibut zombie sleep you're not going to recover and be able to finish the job with any girl that night, you're going to be borderline KO'd for hours). Simply put, I highly f*cking doubt that anyone writing a review has more experience with this compound than I do, and I want to illuminate for you EXACTLY what you can expect from it, how to use it effectively, how to assess your tolerance, how to cycle it, what it feels like, side effects, dosages, and everything in between. Without further adieu, let's begin.

It's a pretty remarkable supplement to say the least, and it has been a huge part of my life (especially my dating life) for the past 7 years. Phenibut Benefits – Kills social anxiety as well as general anxiety – Increases social freedom and the desire to socialize – Decreases stress – Can drastically improve your mood – Produces slight to moderate euphoria – Increases sense of well-being – Increases levels of relaxation – Increases levels of focus and motivation – Enhances cognitive function – Music sounds amazing on Phenibut – Very deep levels of sleep (Phenibut can act as a very potent sleep aid at a high enough dose) – No loss of motor function like with alcohol – Improved sexual performance and increased libido (women especially) I have been personally using Phenibut for years now (since 2012) and it has been a HUGE help in allowing me to bust through social plateaus, build an amazing dating/sex life, kill it in job interviews and nerve wracking business presentations, among countless other benefits.  Being able to curb my anxiety in high pressure situations like job interviews, hitting on gorgeous 10/10 women at the drop of a hat no matter where I was (even if they were complete strangers), and just feeling amazing in general helped me achieve my goals in a much more timely manner, and ultimately helped me build the amazing social circles and sex life that I knew I wanted. I'm not saying I attribute all of those things to Phenibut, but it certainly helped me get to that point quicker and easier. Don't Be That Guy Who Has To Chug A Half Litre of Vodka Just To Have The Balls To Hit On Beautiful Women There is a reason that when 99% of guys want to get laid, they go to one place and one place only. The bar or club. Why is this such a common phenomena? It’s because it is the only environment where it is socially acceptable to get completely inebriated drunk, and getting absolutely devastated out of their minds is the only way the majority of men are capable of mustering up the balls to go up to gorgeous women attempting to get laid. Phenibut For Social Anxiety Social anxiety is a prevalent issue, and seems to affect a greater proportion of men at an alarming growth rate year after year. Unfortunately, it seems to plague men the most due to societal conformity and their tendency to find comfort in not putting themselves in uncomfortable situations. While I’m all for using all the crutches you can at your disposal to make your social life more eventful, I personally can’t stand alcohol because of how absurdly sloppy it makes men when they are under the influence. What’s the point of having your social inhibitions lowered if you are stumbling around, can barely form a coherent sentence, are drooling while you’re talking, and can’t even get it up (get an erection). The reason Phenibut excels in a social setting so much is that it is one of the few compounds that can replicate the same loosening up effect of alcohol without the loss of motor skills or sloppy disorientation. What Does Phenibut Feel Like?  A sense of calm, cool collectedness will overcome you, and situations which would typically have your nerves flying through the roof will suddenly seem like not a big deal. The effects of Phenibut are subtle, but powerful. You will not feel high, so don't expect that. It is almost like a background effect, and other than having a generally better mood, you may not notice the benefits it truly is capable of providing until you put yourself in a situation that would spike your anxiety or stress levels. I notice its’ benefits most myself when I’m going to job interviews, hitting on women, and doing high pressure business presentations.  In these situations my anxiety and stress would typically be higher than average, and on Phenibut it is SO INCREDIBLY OBVIOUS how curbed these emotions are when I’m immersed in a high-pressure situation. Something that would otherwise seem like a colossal challenge can be a walk in the park on Phenibut. How To Use Phenibut Phenibut is generally taken via ingesting pure Phenibut powder. You can measure it using a scale or a measuring spoon. I literally just throw it into my mouth, chase it with some water, and then swallow it. It can also be mixed into a drink or encapsulated if you can't handle the taste. If you mix it in a drink, choose a calorie free drink like diet pop, black coffee, tea, etc. Many users highly recommend mixing Phenibut with caffeine or another stimulant. 80 – 160 mg of caffeine is the preferred amount. This caffeine needs to come from a calorie free source though or else you will inhibit the effects of the Phenibut instead of make them more potent which is the goal. A couple of my go to zero calorie stimulant sources are caffeine pills, diet energy drinks, and black coffee. This is the dosing protocol I followed when I started Phenibut in 2012, and is the same protocol I recommend for all newbies: Take 1000 mg of Phenibut on a totally empty stomach in the morning upon waking (1500 mg if you weigh more than 210 pounds). Women should start with 500-1000 mg. Take 80-160 mg of caffeine from a zero calorie source immediately after taking your Phenibut. After 45-60 minutes you can eat something if you want. After 90-120 minutes of dosing it evaluate how you feel. Phenibut can take long to start working in some cases, sometimes 4-5 hours. However it usually will produce noticeable effects in about 2 hours or sooner. If you feel nothing after 2 hours, take another 500 – 1000 mg dose. 5 hours after your initial dose, re-evaluate how you feel again (and based on your plans for the rest of the day, night) consider taking 500-1000 mg more. Exceeding 4000 mg in a day will find you creeping closer to Phenibut induced zombie sleep, and once you exceed that dose and start venturing into 5000-6000 mg territory you will more than likely become an incapacitated sleeping rock for the remainder of the day. Phenibut can be used as an acute potent sleep aid (infrequently) at higher doses, hence why dosing Phenibut anywhere past 4000 mg per day will start to put you less into a pro-social mindset, and more into a tired and want to crash with the deepest sleep you’ve ever had mindset. Do not take Phenibut more than 2 days per week, as your body will start growing a tolerance towards it. How Does Phenibut Work? Phenibut is a GABA analogue which can easily pass through the blood-brain barrier and bind to the GABA receptors in the brain, unlike GABA itself which cannot. Once it has passed through the blood-brain barrier, Phenibut works by binding to the “GABA-B” receptors in the brain, in turn producing a variety of it’s own specific benefits (as outlined at the beginning of this article). You will notice if you look into other compounds that bind to the GABA receptors that they all produce similar effects to one another. This is what makes Phenibut provide benefits so similar (and arguably better) to many drugs that are prescribed for anxiety. Phenibut is so effective at reducing anxiety that many users report that they actually like it MORE than prescription drugs designed for anxiety! Using Caffeine With Phenibut Stimulants like caffeine tend to greatly potentiate the effects of Phenibut. Phenibut can also cause sleepiness at moderate doses. Because of this, it is recommended that you take some caffeine alongside your Phenibut dose (unless you are using it as a sleep aid obviously). The amount of caffeine you ingest with it should be equivalent to 1-1.5 cups of coffee (100-150mg). Make sure the caffeine source you have doesn’t contain any calories though or else then you are no longer taking Phenibut on an empty stomach. Phenibut Side Effects I believe that Phenibut is a fairly low-risk compound if a safe dosing protocol is followed and it isn't used too often. If you use it several days per week, you may start to develop a dependency on it, which can lead to withdrawal symptoms upon the cessation of its use. These are extremely unpleasant, and is why I urge you to only use Phenibut a couple times a week ideally. Do not operate drive or operate machinery after taking Phenibut, as your motor skills may be slightly impaired. As mentioned earlier, in higher dosages (and low-moderate dosages for high-sensitivity individuals) Phenibut is a very potent sleep aid, so keep that in mind. There can be mild hangover-like symptoms (similar to an alcohol hangover but far less intense) in some very high-sensitivity individuals as well. Another very notable side effect is how much the effects of Alcohol are potentiated while Phenibut is in your system. Alcohol Will Hit You Much Harder If You Are On Phenibut  Alcohol and Phenibut both affect the same GABA receptors in your brain, and as a result, they compound each other’s effects substantially when taken together. I'm not exaggerating when I say that drinking 4 beers will feel like you just drank 6-8 beers while on Phenibut. While some may feel this is advantageous, absolutely under no circumstances drive or operate any kind of vehicle with both Phenibut and alcohol in your system. This past summer I was downtown with a new girl I was seeing who had asked to try some of my Phenibut for a night out. She didn’t take my warning about alcohol with Phenibut too seriously, and by the end of the night this girl was literally a drunk disaster. Just hammered out of her mind, off of maybe 4 shots of tequila. The compounding effect of Phenibut and alcohol concurrently can be a shock to some, but it needs to be taken seriously and extreme caution must be taken if you intend to combine them. Personally, I avoid alcohol for social anxiety purposes entirely, regardless if I'm using Phenibut or not, because it is just a subpar drug and the benefits don't make up for the massive drawbacks it has. What Kind Of Social Situations Is Phenibut Ideal For? Anytime you want a boost in social freedom, mood, stress relief, etc. Phenibut is perfect. I find it excels most in situations like stressful job interviews, dates, and business presentations, but it can literally be used at any time to greatly enhance your social freedom.  In Conclusion Phenibut has multiple uses, and it definitely is a powerful supplement and can have a hugely positive impact on your life if you respect the compound and dose it responsibly. Stick to the recommended dosing guidelines, and you will experience only the positives that Phenibut has to offer and have a fantastic new tool at your disposal.

    "content": "The Top 10 Things You Should Always Have In Your Gym Bag     I’m often asked what’s in my gym bag that I’m dragging around with me every time I’m at the gym. I’m going to outline the 10 essentials I always have with me, and that serious lifters should always have in their gym bags. Obviously some of these might not be applicable for you, but I have found each and every one of the following items EXTREMELY useful in progressing my strength and physique over the years. 1) Wireless Headphones Before I delve into the functional workout equipment that will help you get bigger, stronger, stay injury free, etc. I should tell you guys about wireless Bluetooth headphones. After years of having buds popping out of my ears during the most important sets, or doing exercises when the dumbbell hits the wire and rips the buds out of my ears, or having headphones that simply have a big ass wire constantly getting in the way, I finally upgraded to wireless Bluetooth headphones.  And I honestly think they are a necessity. I can’t even count how many times wires have gotten in my way in the gym, pissed me off, and screwed up my set. These wireless headphones have high quality sound, they are cheap, the battery life is very long, and best of all, it doesn’t get in my f*cking way during important lifts. Obviously any good quality pair of wireless headphones will work, if you care though these are the ones I’ve been using and I definitely prefer them to all the other headphones I’ve tried for the reasons I outlined above. You can order them here: http://amzn.to/2gdhtVu 2) 0.5 Pound Plates I remember in 2008/2009 when I first started working out, I was wondering why nobody had invented these yet.  I don’t know about you guys, but it is the most annoying thing in the world how gyms only have a minimum of 2.5 pound plates. You know as well as I do, that when trying to break strength plateaus on certain lifts like the bench press, 2.5 pounds extra on each side (5 pounds total) is near impossible to constantly add to your lift each and every week consistently. This makes progressive overload and increasing your strength every week VERY DIFFICULT. Thankfully, some smart SOB finally invented 0.5 pound plates, and now you can add exactly 1 pound to your lifts every single workout.  5 pounds is very noticeable (too noticeable), and is actually way too much to add every single workout when even the slightest increase in difficulty will prove too much for a plateaued muscle to handle. 1 pound on the other hand is MUCH more manageable, and you can easily slap an extra 0.5 pounds on each side of any lift week after week. You will get 8 of these plates when you buy them, allowing you to micro-load between 1-4 pounds each workout. Eventually, this adds up, and before you know it, you will have accrued a huge amount of new strength that you could have never done if you were stuck using the weights provided by your gym. I highly recommend you grab some of these if you are serious about adding huge strength to your lifts. You can order the same 0.5 pound plates I use with the following link: https://moreplatesmoredates.com/halfpoundplates 3) A Good Weightlifting Belt:  It should go without saying that having a good weightlifting belt is an absolute necessity, at least on days you train your back or your legs.  There are some people that actually believe you’re a pussy if you use a weight belt because you’re not lifting the weight “raw.” I could care less about if I’m lifting the weight “raw” or not, and frankly I find it kind of ridiculous that someone would put themselves at risk of injury simply so they can feel like they are more masculine than someone who uses a belt. I’m not going to make a myriad of points as to why you should use a belt too or why it’s stupid to not use one, but I’ll tell you this. With a heavy weight on your back, a belt will drastically reduce your chance of an orthopaedic injury by reducing stress on the spine and creating better body biomechanics (no brainer already in my opinion), and it will also improve your lifting performance. I remember reading research conducted by Weider Research Group to actually determine if it increases performance or not and they found that on average, every person who participated could squat 10 pounds heavier while wearing a weight belt than they could without it. The study was done on 12 trainers who had at least 5 years experience of squatting. Research has also shown that wearing a lifting belt during squats increases the level of muscle activation in the quads and hamstrings, consequently promoting better muscle growth.  There are a million belts out there, and so far out of all the belts I’ve tried, this one is my favourite (I’ve gone through a lot of different belts): You can order the belt here: https://moreplatesmoredates.com/weighttrainingbelt 4) Alpha/Fat Grips: If you have weak or small forearms, you NEED to get these.  I have terrible forearms, and I find that they need a lot of direct stimulation to actually grow. I had no idea these even existed until a couple years ago, and damn are they ever good for blowing up your forearms. These grips you can wrap around whatever bar you’re using, making it a lot fatter. The point of doing this is it makes it 10x harder for you to hold onto the bar, which will directly engage your forearms a lot more. The end result of doing bicep curls, deadlifts, (or any other exercises pretty much) with these grips is an INSANE forearm pump.  I’d recommend starting with the 2.5 inch grips first, and then once you have built up your forearm strength a bit more to upgrade to the 3.0 inch grips.  These are no joke, and will have your forearms on fire. They also reduce the pressure on your joints that certain exercises cause, which helps prevent injuries, which is a cool extra benefit. You can order them here: https://moreplatesmoredates.com/2.5inchfatgrips https://moreplatesmoredates.com/3inchfatgrips 5) Rubberized Lifting Straps: Nobody should go without having a solid pair of lifting straps in their gym bag. Lifting straps make holding onto heavy weights on back day, and other “pull” days (days where you do pulling exercises) soooooooo much easier. I don't know why, but there are VERY few companies putting rubber on their lifting straps. You will find that the rubberized ones are exponentially better for your grip, as it is simply so much easier to hold onto heavy weight when there is rubber under your hands for a high level of traction. Most companies will just have the same material on both sides of the strap, but the ONLY straps I use and have ever used are the WSF Rubberized Lifting Straps. I've literally bought about 5 pairs over the last 8 years, and I use them until the rubber is completely destroyed, and then go get a new pair. There is no lifting strap on the market that can even relatively compare to these. Rubber Straps Vs. Normal Straps = Night and Day When you don’t have to worry about your grip at all, you can not only lift heavier, but you can directly engage your back (or whatever muscle you’re targeting) with much greater ease, and achieve a much greater level of mind-muscle connection. They also help provide support to the wrist joint so that you can go heavier on certain movements (like dumbbell lateral raises) without worrying about your wrists blowing out. You can order the same high quality straps I use here: https://moreplatesmoredates.com/liftingstraps 6) Neoprene Knee Sleeves: I have struggled with knee issues for years after squatting way too heavy and not using proper form and gear.  First off, if you have knee issues, address your form. The mechanics of your form are likely one of the culprits of your injury. However, even if your form is perfect, there is no denying that the human body wasn’t exactly created to be able to squat 500 pounds to the grass. Holding a giant load of weight over your body and squatting it down puts tremendous stress on your joints, ligaments, and tendons, and over time with wear and tear, you will eventually encounter some sort of issues more than likely. This is why I always ensure my knees are wrapped up when I go heavy, to take a lot of the stress off of my knees. These Neoprene Knee Sleeves provide a huge amount of stability and support for heavy lifts, are comfortable, and reduces the pressure exerted on my knees.  Absolutely essential for bodybuilding, powerlifting, or just normal weight lifting longevity and injury prevention. You can order a high quality knee sleeves here: https://moreplatesmoredates.com/neoprenekneesleeves 7) Lifting Gloves: This one isn’t as much of a necessity, but my grip strength isn’t fantastic, and I found that when I used to deadlift 500+ pounds, I would not only need my straps to hold onto the bar, but I would also need a good pair of lifting gloves to hold onto the weight without dropping it mid-set because my hands got too sweaty and my gym doesn't allow chalk to be used. When you are first starting out, calluses can get pretty painful too when your skin is adjusting to holding onto heavy raw iron on a daily basis. I used to go home with bloody hands constantly. Obviously eventually your skin will adapt and you will develop calluses, but on days when you need to rip some heavy weight off the ground, or you have open wounds all over your hands from being a newbie, lifting gloves are very helpful to have on hand.  I don’t use mine as much as I used to, but they are still in my bag just in case I decide I want to do some very heavy deadlifts or farmer’s walks. You can order high quality lifting gloves here: https://moreplatesmoredates.com/liftinggloves 8) Whey Isolate: After a grueling weight training session when your muscles are depleted, and your glycogen stores are tapped out, the number one thing you need to worry about is starting the muscle protein synthesis (muscle recovery) process as quickly as possible. The longer you wait, the longer your muscles are sitting there dying for nutrients and in a catabolic state. You want to get a lean protein source in your body ASAP and start the recovery process. This is where a high quality Whey Isolate comes into play.  Dip into your handy dandy gym bag, and grab the bag of 2 scoops Whey Isolate you packed from home and make a shake with it. Whey protein is bar none the fastest digesting protein source, making it the most ideal thing to consume post-workout, as we want something the body can process as quickly as possible, digest, and start feeding those muscles. Although Whey protein in general is the ideal post-workout protein source, Whey Isolate in particular is more optimal than Whey Concentrate. The reason why Whey Isolate is the optimal choice over Whey Concentrate is because it is filtered in the manufacturing facility even more so than Whey Concentrate. By removing more lactose, carbohydrates and fat from a Whey Concentrate, the manufacturer can further filter the protein into a faster digesting protein that is absorbed even quicker by the body. This extra filtered/pure protein is called Whey Isolate. As you can see in the nutritional facts below on the Whey Isolate I use, per 1 scoop it has almost 0 grams of fat, it has 0 grams of carbs, it is only 105 calories, and it has 25 grams of high quality Whey Isolate. That is exactly the kind of nutrient profile we want for lightning fast digestion and recovery.  Make it a priority to get a couple scoops of Whey Isolate consumed as quickly as possible after your workout if you want to maximize your muscle gain potential. You can order the same high quality Whey Isolate I use here: http://amzn.to/2fGmvWB 9) Fast Digesting Carbohydrates (That Are Easy On The Stomach And Won’t Bloat): Coupled with a good Whey Isolate, fast digesting carbs become the next most important thing you need to worry about post-workout. I get asked time and time again what the best post-workout meal is. There is so much misinformation, let me clarify how simple it really is. Post-workout ALL you want and need is a fast digesting Whey Isolate, and a fast digesting Carbohydrate. When you ingest carbs, your blood sugar will go up, causing the Pancreas in your body to release insulin as a countermeasure to bring blood sugar levels back down to homeostasis. Insulin is a shuttling hormone, responsible for transporting nutrients throughout the body faster and more effectively than they would without its’ presence. The result of high insulin levels post-workout is your Whey Isolate getting shuttled to your muscles even quicker, and more efficiently, resulting in more muscle growth. Hence, we want our insulin levels elevated post-workout, so we must ingest a fast-digesting carbohydrate to instigate this process. Some great choices for post-workout simple carbs are Dextrose and Maltodextrin, or Waxy Maize. All of which are processed and digested fairly quickly by the body. However, one issue I have with these carb sources is that they are notorious for causing bloating and gastrointestinal stress in many individuals. If you are bloating and getting excruciating stomach aches, obviously that is counterproductive to muscle growth. Also, Dextrose, Maltodextrin and Waxy Maize have a high osmolality which delays gastric emptying (and subsequently absorption) by the small intestines. What I have found to be the best fast digesting carb source post-workout is Highly Branched Cyclic Dextrins.  Formed by the breakdown of amylopectin, a low osmolality, high molecular weight molecule is formed. Once this branched dextrin cluster hits the stomach it passes through the stomach at an insanely fast speed. This is exactly what you want in a post-workout supplement with your protein. In and out of the stomach quickly to be absorbed by the small intestine, in conjunction with the Whey Isolate you should have ingested alongside it, you can initiate muscle recovery and growth within minutes of finishing your workout. These carbs are fairly new on the market, and are very special as they are one of the first insanely fast digesting carbs that are very light on the stomach. It doesn’t bloat, it doesn’t upset the stomach, and it digests more efficiently than even Dextrose, Maltodextrin, and Waxy Maize. I typically will use 2 scoops of this post-workout, but on really heavy intense workout days like back day or leg day I may opt for 3-4 scoops.  However, when I’m strictly dieting down I will usually limit myself to 2 scoops of this as a maximum post-workout. You can order the same Highly Branched Cyclic Dextrin product I use here: http://amzn.to/2fvMV1T 10) Deodorant That Doesn’t Stain Your Clothes: Ok this one I felt I should add in because there are a lot of stinky mofo’s at the gym, and I actually went through some trial and error before finding a deodorant that didn’t mess up my clothes at all. Obviously, you should use deodorant every day, and if you aren’t, then please start. Throw a stick of this in your gym bag, as you will undoubtedly need it. One thing that annoyed me to no end was all the deodorant products out there that would stain my clothes yellow when I’d sweat. It was disgusting, and very noticeable on my white clothes. Within one day of wearing a white shirt, with a subpar deodorant I would literally have a yellow mini pit stain. Not a good look at all. I eventually stumbled on this deodorant, and have never turned back.  It smells great, doesn’t leave any residue on your arm pits, and best of all, it doesn’t stain your clothes AT ALL. Highly recommend. I’m sure you can probably find this at your local supermarket for a much cheaper price so I advise you check there first, but if for some reason you can’t find it, you can order it here: http://amzn.to/2gd4SSd  Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

    "content": "How To Mix RU58841 In K&B Solution     RU58841 is a non-steroidal experimental anti-androgen, which is intended for use as a topical treatment for acne and androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness). To briefly describe how it works, it is basically a turn-key all in one hair loss compound that blocks all DHT on the scalp, and can significantly improve the life of anybody experiencing hair loss, and I’m shocked it isn’t more heavily researched. I will be using RU for the rest of my life unless something better gets invented. For the carrier (what the RU58841 raw powder is mixed in), I prefer PG (propylene glycol) + Ethanol. I find it rare for someone’s scalp to be irritated by the PG/Ethanol to the point of needing K&B instead as the carrier. They both work fine; some people just seem to have skin irritation to particular carriers as opposed to others. HOWEVER…. If Your Scalp Gets Irritated By Propylene Glycol If you are one of those who’s scalp is irritated by the Propylene Glycol in the traditional standard RU58841 carrier blend, this will be a quick instructional guide for you specifically detailing how to mix a RU58841 solution in K&B Solution. K&B solution is 60% Ethanol, 35% Deionized Water, and 5% K&B Emulsifiers. These are more forgiving on sensitive scalps. If You Have A Very Hard Time Finding Ethanol Another reason K&B solution might be necessary for you to use is if you want to reconstitute your own RU58841 solutions but can’t find Ethanol by itself (it’s not easy to find). All that is required with the K&B solution is to pour your desired amount of RU58841 powder into the premixed K&B solution, then shake or stir lightly until it is thoroughly dissolved and mixed evenly. If you want to mix the standard concentration, use 2.5 grams of raw RU58841 powder in a 50ml K&B solution to achieve a 5% RU58841 solution of 50mg/ml. What You Will Need To Mix Your Own RU58841 Solutions With K&B Solution   RU58841 Raw Powder K&B solution 50ML A Very Accurate Digital Scale Glass Stirring Rod 1x 50ml Measuring Beaker A Funnel  The Instructions Turn on your scale and make sure it’s measuring in grams as its’ unit of measurement. Once you see that it’s turned on and at 0 grams, put an empty beaker on the scale. After the measurement has stabilized, turn the scale back to 0 with the beaker still on it by pressing the “Tare” button. Once you press this, it will reset the scale to 0 even with the beaker on it. The purpose of this is so we can determine what 2.5 grams of RU5881 powder is without the beaker screwing up our measurement. Add 2.5 grams of powder to the empty beaker on the scale until you see the scale reading 2.5 grams. Once you’ve done that, you can turn off the scale and put it away. Next, pour the 50ml of K&B solution into the beaker with the 2.5 grams of RU58841 raw powder. You should now have a cloudy solution of RU58841. All you need to do now is get your glass stirring rod, and stir the solution until it is crystal clear and you can’t see any fragments of unmixed RU58841 powder in it. Once it’s crystal clear your solution is ready to go, and you can get your funnel and 50ml+ K&B container and pour the solution through the funnel back into the empty bottle you have to store your solution in. There you have it, now you have a 50ml 5% RU58841 K&B solution dosed at 50mg/ml. Store it in the fridge and out of the light ideally to maximize the shelf life and prevent any degradation to the solution. Room temperature is the least ideal scenario, but if you don’t have a fridge or freezer you can store it in, then at least make sure it’s in a cool, dry place, out of direct light when you’re storing it at room temperature.

    "content": "How To Make A RU58841 And Minoxidil Combination Solution     If you cannot source Ethanol, or you simply don’t want to spend the money on it as you already currently use liquid Minoxidil, aside from K&B solution, one of the only other viable alternatives would be to mix your RU58841 raw powder in your Minoxidil liquid. This will only work if you use Minoxidil liquid, and won’t work if you use the foam. Or you could simply use the foam during your morning application of Minoxidil, and then use the liquid RU58841 combo mixture at night for your second Minoxidil application. Ultimately it will be up to you what you find optimal for which type of Minoxidil you use, and what fits into your hair loss prevention protocol and what doesn't. There are advantages and disadvantages to mixing your RU58841 with Minoxidil liquid Advantages:  Cheaper if you already use Minoxidil liquid every day Efficient as Minoxidil already comes in separate 60 ml bottles (very close to the standard 50ml PG + Ethanol solutions we use to measure and mix our RU58841 Easy to find and very cheap  Disadvantages:   Requires that you use Minoxidil every single time you apply RU58841 because they are mixed Makes small dosing changes near impossible because if you want to alter your RU58841 dosage, then you will also be forced to alter your Minoxidil dosage, which could lead to unwanted side effects. Perhaps exhibits less efficacy/ability to deliver RU58841 to the hair follicles than a 70%/30% Ethanol/Propylene Glycol solution can  If you already use Minoxidil liquid every day, you want to use RU58841, and your dose has consistently proved to be constant between the two compounds, you may be in the ideal position to use your Minoxidil liquid as your mixing solution for RU58841. What You Will Need To Mix Your Own RU58841 And Minoxidil Combination Solutions  RU58841 Raw Powder   Fast Drying/Non-Oily Minoxidil Liquid   A Very Accurate Digital Scale   Glass Stirring Rod   50ml Measuring Beaker   A Funnel  How To Mix Minoxidil And RU58841 It is actually quite simple how to mix the two, and it simply involves some basic math. Hypothetically, let’s say you want to make a 5% strength 50mg/ml RU58841 solution (the most popular dosage/strength). Because Minoxidil bottles come in 60ml each, you will need to measure out 3000mg (3 grams) of RU58841 raw powder per bottle of Minoxidil. To do this, turn on your scale and make sure it’s measuring in grams as its’ unit of measurement. Once you see that it’s turned on and at 0 grams, put an empty beaker on the scale. After the measurement has stabilized, turn the scale back to 0 with the beaker still on it by pressing the “Tare” button. Once you press this, it will reset the scale to 0 even with the beaker on it. The purpose of this is so we can determine what 3 grams of RU5881 powder is without the beaker screwing up our measurement. Add 3 grams of powder to the empty beaker on the scale until you see the scale reading 3 grams. Once you’ve done that, you can turn off the scale and put it away. Adding The RU58841 Powder To The Minoxidil Liquid Solution Get a funnel out and pour the 3 grams of RU58841 powder you just measured out into one of the 60ml bottles of Minoxidil liquid. Shake and swirl the solution lightly until the RU58841 powder has completely dissolved inside the bottle, and the solution is completely clear. That’s all there is to it. Now you have a bottle of Minoxidil with 50mg of RU58841 in each ml of solution.

    "content": "How To Store RU58841 Mixed Solutions And RU58841 Raw Powder     If you don’t already know what RU58841 is, it is a non-steroidal experimental anti-androgen, which is intended for use as a topical treatment for acne and androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness).  If you haven’t read my overview article on RU58841 check it out here: RU58841 There are a lot of myths surrounding the proper storage of this research chemical, and I’m going to quickly clarify every thing for you in this quick article. How To Store RU58841 Pre-Mixed Solutions Essentially, to prevent degradation of the compound, you simply must make sure it's stored out of any direct light and it's in a cold enough temperature. The only two viable places that your everyday household would have for proper storage conditions of RU58841 are the freezer, or the fridge. Although RU58841 can remain potent in room temperature for a while, I put my mixed solutions into sealable 50ml bottles, and then put the bottles into a container, shut the container so no light can get in, and then put that in the fridge. My raw RU powder is always sealed in zip-locks though in the freezer. I've actually noted as of recent that storing mixed solutions (not RU raw powder) in the fridge is probably more ideal than the freezer for convenience reasons. Allow me to explain this, as I used to recommend storing all RU58841 (mixed and unmixed) in the freezer. Although the freezer will ultimately result in the greatest longevity without degradation of the product, it can cause slight crystallization of the RU58841 powder reconstituted in the Ethanol/PG, making it so you may have to let it sit in room temperature and then lightly shake it a bit to make sure it's fully dissolved again prior to each administration. No crystallization occurs in the fridge though. It's also still cold enough to offset degradation to a large degree, but not cold enough to cause crystallization of the powder in the solution basically. This makes the fridge ideal for the storage of mixed solutions. How To Store RU58841 Raw Powder As opposed to pre-mixed RU58841 solutions, all RU58841 raw powder (unmixed) should always be kept in the freezer. I keep those sealed in several ziplock bags, in another closed container to ensure no water somehow seeps in and hits the powder. If you follow the storage recommendation outlined above in your research, you will maximize the potency and longevity of your RU58841.

    "date": "2016-11-02T06:22:09+00:00",
    "content": "Will Your Hair Recover After Shedding Caused By Stopping Minoxidil     Will your hair recover from shedding induced from discontinuing Minoxidil treatment is a very common concern. Very few seem to have the answer to this question for some reason.  Acute Telogen Effluvium  This is something that often occurs to those who start Minoxidil, and then suddenly stop it cold turkey. They experience an acute increased shedding phase, and it can be very difficult to deal with. I’m going to shed some light on my experience with this though in this article and hopefully help un-frighten many of you. If you’ve researched Minoxidil, you probably know at least in a rudimentary way how it works. It has an initial shedding phase that causes dormant hairs to be shed to make room for new growth, and ultimately better growth down the line in a few months after the life cycle of the hairs affected by Minoxidil have run their course. Minoxidil also widens the hair follicle, causing thicker strands of hair to grow, and keeping them in the anagen (growth) stage for a longer period of time, allowing them to get even longer and thicker than they normally would. The first couple months of Minoxidil use can be excruciating for some, as it essentially makes your hair look worse before it gets better. This is VERY mentally taxing on individuals, who are probably turning to Minoxidil in the first place because they are already unhappy with their hair. Minoxidil definitely isn’t for the weak of mind, as you have to trust the process by which it works, and be patient while you let yourself start looking even worse, on the journey to looking better. During this initial shed phase, many simply can’t make it through this period and jump ship early. The issue with this lies in the fact that these individuals who jump ship and stop treatment have already used Minoxidil for a short period of time and have induced the shedding phase. Essentially inducing further hair loss without even having any improvements in store for them down the line because they discontinued the Minoxidil. Can Minoxidil Make You Permanently Lose More Hair? This is where a big debate has been ignited, as there are a large majority of individuals who are absolutely convinced that Minoxidil has essentially poisoned their hair and further worsened its’ state. The other side of the spectrum has individuals who feel that even if you stop Minoxidil early, you aren’t actually furthering hair loss, rather, you are simply inducing the shed phase, and your hair will eventually return to its’ pre-Minoxidil state after the hair life cycle has completed in a few months. The Truth The fact of the matter is that Minoxidil stimulates hair follicles and growth, but does not reduce dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or the enzyme responsible for its accumulation around the hair follicle, 5-alpha reductase, which is the primary mediator of male pattern baldness in genetically susceptible individuals. Therefore, when treatment is stopped, the DHT has its expected effect of shrinking and ultimately destroying the genetically predisposed hair follicles. This means that hair loss will continue as it normally would without any hair loss protection if you stop Minoxidil, and any hair that was being grown or maintained with Minoxidil will inevitably die and fall off your head. So, what would happen is your hair would return to the same state it was in prior to Minoxidil use, but Minoxidil won’t accelerate permanent hair loss. It just seems like it does because so many individuals will freak out during the shedding phase, stop Minoxidil cold turkey, and then have to experience a much worse looking hair line than they previously had for a few months until the life cycle of the hair brings everything back to what it was pre-Minoxidil use. This is why if you choose to use Minoxidil, you should be prepared to be using it for a VERY long time. Once the life cycle of the hairs that shed have concluded and they are once again in the anagen stage, some token individuals still report that their hair is worse than it was pre-Minoxidil use, so it is only logical to assume that Minoxidil was the culprit for permanently furthering their hair loss. On the contrary, the explanation for this scenario is rather simple as well. By the time an individual has recovered the hairs lost from the Minoxidil shedding phase or the acute telogen effluvium induced by stopping Minoxidil, they will simply be exactly where they would be hair loss wise if they never used Minoxidil in the first place. The issue with acute Minoxidil usage is that every one who uses it sets their base line of what they will compare their hair loss to as their first day pre-Minoxidil use. So, when they experience acute telogen effluvium, they expect that once the mayhem has concluded that their hair should look exactly like it did on Day 1 of Minoxidil use. The Issue With Using Minoxidil Day 1 As Your Defined Hair Reference “Baseline”  The issue with this logic is that it takes several months to fully recover your hair density from acute telogen effluvium, and in this time frame your hair loss is likely still moving you closer to the bald side of the spectrum. So, while you sit there observing your hair recovery every day without any hair loss prevention products being used, your genetic path to baldness is still progressing like it would normally, as you have zero protection! Many individuals seem to completely disregard this and simply think that Minoxidil furthered their hair loss, but the reality is that your hair loss is progressing just like it normally would, and even once you “recover” from post-Minoxidil shedding, your new baseline may very well be a lot worse than your previous baseline half a year ago because your Androgenic Alopecia has progressed just like it would regardless of all the other factors. Minoxidil isn’t poison, and it has been the saviour of thousands of men’s hair, so I highly suggest you embrace it if your hair is in severe need of saving. My Experience With Acute Telogen Effluvium  The first time I tried Minoxidil, I used way too much. I was far too generous with my applications, and would likely double my dose on a regular basis because I wanted to ensure the stuff was working. With Minoxidil though, you need to realize that more is not better. And when you start using more thinking it’s going to be better results wise, you will simply increase your risk of side effects. Within a week I had gained 7 pounds of water weight, and my face looked fat and disgusting (at least in my opinion it did). My natural uneducated reaction back then was to stop Minoxidil cold turkey. This is when I was introduced to my super awesome friend acute telogen effluvium (syke). My hair shed like crazy, it was the most I had ever seen and I was getting very worried. However, I kept up with the rest of my hair loss prevention regimen using my RU58841 every night and my Ketoconazole shampoo every time I showered, and did A LOT of research into what exactly telogen effluvium is, and my mind was soon put at ease. Within a couple months I noticed that my hair density was starting to return to where it was previously severely thinning. Finally, my hair had returned to base line, and my hair had not worsened in any notable way. Another Huge Mistake Guys Make With Minoxidil This mistake is a common one. It is where someone experiences shedding from Minoxidil, quits it cold turkey because they can’t mentally deal with it, induce acute telogen effluvium, and then hop back on Minoxidil because they are afraid of not having protection while they are still shedding. This yo-yo effect of stopping and starting Minoxidil over and over in short bursts is just asking for side effects, and also will leave you in a state where you will never recover your hair, or improve your hair. Minoxidil is a long-term commitment for it to work well, and it absolutely does if you trust in the process. My Recommended Minoxidil Product I recommend ‘Intelligent' brand Minoxidil as it is formulated to dry faster with much less grease. Most cheap generic brands like Kirkland are so oily they make your hair look terrible and greasy for hours after use.

    "content": "14 Tricks And Delicious Low Calorie Foods To Get Shredded Easily     The number 1 reason why most people can’t get shredded is because they can’t stick to a strict diet. The reason they can’t stick to a strict diet is almost always because the diet eventually gets so low in calories that to get ripped they would need to feel like they are starving all day long. Feeling hungry is not only distracting, but it makes it borderline impossible to stay on track and stick to your calorie allotment for the day.  This article includes 14 products I’ve come to learn over the past half a decade can make dieting a walk in the park. Sticking to a diet actually isn’t that difficult if your meals are at least somewhat enjoyable, and you can keep your appetite suppressed with some of the following items I recommend.  Without further adieu: 1. Sparkling Water This should be the first thing you go drink when you wake up. Sparkling water is just like normal water, but it is carbonated. The trick behind it is that when you drink it in the morning, the carbonation in the water will help fill your stomach up, making you feel satiated. By tricking your stomach into thinking there is food in your stomach with the carbonation, your brain will be signaled to stop producing hunger hormones, and you can effectively crush any morning cravings you might have in the morning.  You Can Buy Sparkling Water HERE 2. Black Coffee Black Coffee is a tried and true method of suppressing your appetite. Where most people screw up is they will add sugar and other calorie dense additives to their coffees to make it taste delicious, but ultimately they just end up with a sugar dense concoction with more calories in it than a hamburger from McDonalds. This defeats the whole purpose of it. What you want to do is wait until you start feeling hungry, and then go make yourself a cup of black coffee sweetened with Stevia. Stevia is an all-natural sugar replacement. It tastes exactly like regular sugar, but it has 0 calories in it, and it doesn’t induce an insulin spike in the body. This will not only prevent you from getting hungrier (insulin spikes will make you even more hungry), but it will also prevent your body from shifting from fat-burning mode to fat-storing mode (your body cannot burn fat while insulin is spiked).  You Can Buy My Favorite Coffee HERE 3. Sugar Free Monster Energy Drinks I arguably have a slight Monster addiction. I love the taste of them, and they are essentially zero calorie drinks. There is no more than 10 calories in even the most calorie dense sugar-free Monster flavor. They range between 0-10 calories per can depending on the flavor. I like these so much not only because they’re very portable and easy to bring on the go, but they taste delicious, and they have caffeine in it which gives me a good energy boost in an energy deprived state caused by eating in a calorie deficit. The caffeine also helps suppress your appetite. These are my two favorite flavors:  You Can Buy Sugar Free Monster Energy Drinks In Bulk HERE 4. Ephedrine Ephedrine is one of the greatest fat-burning compounds ever. Not only is it a great energy booster and pre-workout supplement, but also it suppresses appetite even more than caffeine does in my opinion. Occasionally I will pop three 8mg pills to kill my appetite, or just give me the kick in the ass I need when I’m feeling run down. Ephedrine is illegal in some countries; luckily here in Canada you can still buy it right over the counter at local supplement stores.  You Can Buy Ephedrine (If You Live In Canada) HERE 5. Sugar Free Jello This is possibly one of the best-kept secrets in your local grocery store. Sugar free Jello tastes like any sugary desert would, but it literally has no carbs or sugar in it at all, and it has only 10 calories for a quarter pack of it. Typically, I will make 2 full packages of this stuff at a time in a glass tray, and then once it has settled in my fridge overnight I will eat half of the tray (1 full package) in a sitting the next day. Even if you were having a brutal craving and “binged” on 2 full packages of this stuff, I can 99% guarantee by the end of the 2 packages you will be full and satisfied. 2 full packages are only a whopping 80 calories. This stuff makes sticking to a diet much easier, and anytime I get a sugar craving I’ll just go have a bowl of this.  You Can Buy Sugar Free Jell-O In Bulk HERE 6. Walden Farms Sauces, Dressings, Syrups, Condiments, Spreads & Dips Ahhh Walden Farms. Many diets good ol’ Walden and his Farm have gotten me through. Walden Farms makes such a vast array of delicious products it’s honestly pretty unbelievable. Even more unbelievable is that they still taste decent and they’re 0 calorie. Granted, a lot of the products are hit or miss, but the trick is finding all the “hits” and loading up on them. I’ll show you guys some of my favorite “hits” that are guaranteed to spice up your diet.       You Can Buy Walden Farms Sauces, Dressings, Syrups, Condiments, Spreads & Dips Here: Calorie Free Pancake Syrup Calorie Free Chocolate Syrup  Calorie Free Italian Dressing Calorie Free Strawberry Fruit Spread Calorie Free Honey Mustard Mayo Calorie Free Marshmallow Dip 7. Diet Soda Nothing really needs to be said about diet soda. It’s delicious, tastes identical to the sugar dense version, and kills cravings. My favorites are coke zero, and diet orange crush.   Recently I’ve actually started adding calorie free vanilla syrup to my coke zero too and making my own concoctions of diet vanilla coke.  You Can Buy DaVinci Gourmet Sugar Free Vanilla Syrup HERE 8. Sugar Free Gum Sugar free gum is an awesome way to stave off cravings. With less than 5 calories per piece, sugar free gum will not only keep your mouth busy, but it actually promotes satiety in the body and will prevent you from getting as hungry.  You Can Buy My Favorite Sugar Free Gum HERE 9. BCAA’s Finding a decent tasting BCAA can be a pivotal move in sticking to a diet. BCAA’s are calorie free, and are more satiating than normal water would be. Not only that, but they help in the muscle recovery process. Sometimes to kill a craving I will blend up some ice, throw in a couple scoops of BCAA’s, and then put in some water and blend up my own homemade BCAA slushie. Unfortunately, a lot of BCAA’s taste like ass and mix terribly. So, make sure when you get BCAA’s you check the reviews and you get something like Xtend. It mixes great, tastes good, and comes from arguably the most credible company for their BCAA products (Scivation).  You Can Buy Xtend BCAA's HERE 10. Salads Having lots of leafy greens and other extremely low calorie veggies will allow you to eat a higher quantity of food, without pushing your calorie intake past your daily goals. When I get really hungry, I like to incorporate a giant salad into my daily meal plan as it is literally no more than 50 calories for a giant bowl of lettuce, spinach, and other greens and veggies, but it gets me really full and prevents me from getting cravings. I also like to add some of the Walden Farms dressings to it to make it actually taste good instead of bland and boring.  11. PB2 Peanut Butter With 85% less fat than normal Peanut Butter, PB2 Peanut Butter is an all-natural powdered Peanut Butter product deriving from peanuts that are first slow roasted, and then pressed to remove the fat and oil. You simply add some water to a couple tablespoons of the powder, and then stir it and in seconds it will change into good old peanut butter. The consistency, look, texture, and taste are all identical to normal Peanut Butter. The end result is a Peanut Butter that tastes just as fantastic as regular Peanut Butter, but has WAY less calories. Sometimes if I need something quick and small because I’m just too damn hungry, I will have a tablespoon or two of PB2, and then I’m good to go for another couple hours. PB2 is also packed with much more protein than regular Peanut Butter is, which is another awesome feature it has. 1 Tablespoon of regular Peanut Butter typically has about 100 calories and 1-2 grams of protein. 2 Tablespoons of PB2 has only 45 calories and 5 grams of protein. No brainer.  You Can Buy PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter HERE 12. Shirataki Noodles Shirataki Noodles look and taste exactly like normal pasta noodles do. However, they aren’t carb dense whatsoever, and as a result, they have almost no calories at all. In fact, the brand I personally use has 0 calories in an entire package. This is a fantastic diet food because you can literally cook 2 whole packages of these noodles and have a giant chicken and noodle bowl that will fill you up with less than 250 calories!  With normal pasta noodles, that meal would’ve easily topped out 700+ calories. I like to add some sugar free Teriyaki sauce or low calorie Guy’s BBQ sauce to the bowl for some added flavor.  It is truly delicious, and very low calorie. Dieting is a breeze with these noodles.  You Can Buy Calorie Free Shirataki Noodles HERE 13. Guy’s Sugar Free Barbeque Sauce This is bar none the best low calorie BBQ sauce on earth. Per tablespoon there are only 5 calories, 1 gram of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar. The main issue most sugar-free BBQ sauces have is that the consistency is too thin. They run like water. Guy’s BBQ sauce is thicker though, much more similar to the actual consistency of real BBQ sauce, and it tastes EXACTLY the same. I’m not exaggerating, you will start putting this on all your meat as soon as you try it, and it is absolutely phenomenal for dieting.  You Can Buy My 3 Favorite Flavors Of Guy's Sugar Free BBQ Sauce HERE 14. Seal Sama, Sugar Free Teriyaki Sauce This list wouldn’t be complete without adding this stuff. This sugar-free Teriyaki sauce has only 5 calories per tablespoon, 1 gram of carbs, and 0 grams of sugar. It tastes identical to real Teriyaki sauce, but it is quite a bit thinner. Honestly though, I don’t even care, this is by far the best sugar-free teriyaki sauce I’ve tried, and I drench my chicken, rice and Shirataki Noodles in it all the time. For whatever reason, Amazon's price is obscenely expensive for it though, so I recommend you shop around a bit for this one. I've seen it listed as low as $8 in some online stores. *Update* Found it for a decent price finally.

    "date": "2016-10-21T07:07:00+00:00",
    "content": "Modafinil – What You Can ACTUALLY Expect (It’s Not Like Limitless)     I have had a prescription for Modafinil for a few years now, and I have quite the thorough experience with the stuff to say the least.  Before you jump to the conclusion that I have (or faked having) ADD/ADHD symptoms to get a prescription, let me preface this by saying that Modafinil IS NOT a drug prescribed to treat attention deficit disorder symptoms. Contrary to popular belief, Modafinil is a “Wakefulness Agent” prescribed for those with Narcolepsy, Severe Sleep Apnea, or Shift Work Sleep Disorder. I have an extreme case of Sleep Apnea, and went to the doctor and straight up told them about it, and got a Modafinil prescription in less than 60 seconds.  So what exactly is a “Wakefulness Agent?” A wakefulness agent does exactly what it sounds like it does. It helps you stay awake. This is why Modafinil is prescribed exclusively for those with Narcolepsy, Shift Work Sleep Disorder, or Sleep Apnea. Narcolepsy is a condition where you have a tendency to fall asleep throughout the day at any given moment. The other two conditions are both conditions that lead to extreme daytime sleepiness as well due to poor amounts (or quality) of sleep. You can read more about that in my Sleep Apnea article. Modafinil is prescribed to keep individuals with these conditions awake and functional throughout the day so they can still live normal and productive lives. Modafinil WILL Make You Much More Productive (Sort Of) The mechanism by which Modafinil makes you much more productive is MUCH different in my opinion to how it is described by many online reviewers. Some of whom I have actually started to question if they have ever even actually taken Modafinil because their “experience” seems to differ so vastly from mine. Will you be euphoric, more intelligent, focused like you’re a fucking Terminator who was sent back in time to get tons of work done and become rich and successful?  No. But, you will be more productive (indirectly), and I will explain why later in this article, with a very good example of exactly what a day in the life on Modafinil vs. off Modafinil is like. What Does Modafinil Feel Like? The most accurate way I can describe Modafinil is that it is like Caffeine on steroids, without the anxiety and jitters. The number 1 way I can tell that Modafinil is working is that when nighttime rolls around and I’m usually starting to yawn and doze off on the computer while I’m working, I can plow through for another several hours (or all night and into the morning sometimes) without being tired. That, coupled with the fact that my appetite gets slightly suppressed, are the ONLY notable effects you really feel from Modafinil. You don’t really “feel” anything, you are simply awake. The only time I “feel” Modafinil in a definite way is when I take more than I should and take 400mg+ in a 24-hour period. When I do that I start to get ridden with anxiety and it takes an hour or two for that anxiety to subside. *TIP IF YOU GET ANXIETY FROM MODAFINIL: Taking L-Theanine with Modafinil I have found is a great way to curb the anxiety, and it further aids your mental focus and concentration (can be substantial if you’re a good responder).  I usually take around 400mg L-Theanine depending on what I need to get done that day and what my anxiety level is like. If I stick to my prescribed 200mg Modafinil dose I am anxiety-free every single time though. Modafinil IS NOT Comparable To NZT-48 From Limitless No, it’s not some magical drug that will unlock your brain like its’ purported to by many of the individuals out their claiming it is like NZT-48 from the movie Limitless. Modafinil IS NOT like Adderall. Modafinil IS NOT like NZT-48. Modafinil IS NOT a pro-social drug for hitting on women. Modafinil IS NOT a focus agent. The literal purpose of Modafinil is to keep you awake, and that’s essentially it. An indirect benefit of being completely awake and alert is being able to focus and concentrate for far longer periods of time, however, Modafinil will not enhance your focus to some inhuman level where you are like a robot pumping out quality work. You will still get just as distracted as you were before you took Modafinil, you will just be awake now. The trick is to learn to harness your “awakeness” and manage your time better. Time Is Life’s Most Precious Commodity, And Modafinil Gives You More Of It  The main benefit I see in Modafinil that enters the scope of every generic review you see out there, is that Modafinil will indeed be able to make you more productive. The reason for this though is that you will have more hours in the day that you are capable of being productive, not that the drug itself makes you more productive. When you ingest Modafinil, you don’t have an efficiency switch that flicks on in your brain that suddenly makes you a work horse, rather, you can sleep less, and work more at a higher level of function because you are fully awake and alert during those additional hours. Fighter Jet Pilots And Business Executives Using Modafinil For An Edge If you don’t already know, Modafinil is widely used by fighter pilots to stay sharp while flying. http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/how-fighter-pilots-stay-sharp-20131205 It is also supposedly used by plenty of business executives to consistently work 20-hour workdays. https://techcrunch.com/2008/07/15/how-many-of-our-startup-executives-are-hopped-up-on-provigil/  These are perfect examples of what Modafinil can do, vs. what it cannot do. These individuals aren’t taking Modafinil because of some giant spike in their intelligence or creativity it will provide, rather, they use it because it keeps them awake for longer periods of time. The end result is getting more work done at a high quality level. Productivity In A Day On Modafinil Vs. Off Modafinil Here is a good example of how Modafinil affects productivity for me in particular. I will break down my typical day as it would play out if I took Modafinil vs. if I didn’t take Modafinil that day. Off Modafinil:  9:00 a.m. – Wake up 9:00 a.m. – 11:30 p.m. – Answer emails, workout, run errands, go to work, I start getting hazy and tired around 10:30 p.m. 11:30 p.m. – 12:30 a.m. – Continue working while starting to slightly doze off 12:30 a.m. – 2:00 a.m. – Continue trying to work while intermittently falling in and out of sleep (not really getting anything productive done at this point) 2:00 a.m. – Realize my work quality is starting to go to shit because I’m half asleep so I go to bed On Modafinil:  9:00 a.m. – Wake up 9:00 a.m. – 11:30 p.m. – Answer emails, workout, run errands, go to work 11:30 p.m. – 12:30 a.m. – Continue working 12:30 a.m. – 2:00 a.m. – Continue working 2:00 a.m.-3:30 a.m. – Continue working 3:30 a.m. – Start dozing off a bit and decide I should go to bed because at this point I will need to take more Modafinil to maintain high quality work and then I will be pulling an all nighter (I typically do this once a week to get tons of shit done in one go), or I’ll just go to bed. So, as you can see, on Modafinil I go to bed around roughly the same time, but I have many more hours that are actually productive hours at a 100% level of focus and alertness. Even if I did go to bed at 2:00 a.m. on Modafinil, I still get about 2.5 hours more hours each day to work with that are at a higher level of productivity, with 100% full mental capacity. Whereas by 2:00 a.m. off of Modafinil, I am running on fumes and just typing gibberish while I drool on myself and fall asleep on my keyboard. How To Dose Modafinil: Typically Modafinil is prescribed in dosage increments of 100 mg or 200 mg. Personally, my prescription is for 200 mg per day to treat my Sleep Apnea. Taking more than 200 mg I find is where you start to get the anxiety side effect from Modafinil. In Conclusion: Modafinil is a great drug for productivity, staying awake, and being completely alert. It is prescribed exclusively for those with major sleep disorders, but the benefits that could be experienced from Modafinil for anyone taking it are evidently universally applicable to anybody who needs to focus for longer periods of time, and get more work done (who doesn’t honestly).

    "content": "The Only Health Supplements That Aren’t A Colossal Waste Of Money     I remember very vividly how clueless I was a few years ago when I would go to the health section of the grocery store and try and figure out which vitamins and minerals I would need to optimize my health. Even when I knew the types of products I needed, I’d find so many variations of each product on the shelves I would literally get so annoyed by the whole process because I didn’t want to end up wasting my money on stuff I didn’t need I would just walk out of the store with nothing and tell myself fuck it, I’m young and my health will be fine I’ll worry about this stuff later. It took a few years before I finally determined what I truly feel are necessary for maximizing longevity, and mitigating potentially major catalysts that would lead to health complications.  All the health supplements I mention in this article are the essentials in my opinion. I constantly get blood work to assess my health and make sure everything is up to par, and when I stay on top of this supplementation regimen, even when I was hitting my body pretty hard with bodybuilding drugs, everything stayed within very acceptable levels. Basically, I would’ve been in a far worse position health wise had I not taken these supplements in my honest opinion. Walking around in a larger than average body (even if it’s pure muscle) will ALWAYS cause your heart and lungs to work harder in order to provide your body with an adequate supply of blood and oxygen to fuel that additional mass. Hence, I highly suggest getting started on a daily vitamin and mineral regimen to keep your health (mainly cardiovascular) in check. My Devastating Realization – You Could Be At Risk Even At A Young Age One of my best friends dropped dead from an undiagnosed blood clot the size of a baseball travelling from his calf to his lungs causing a pulmonary embolism, and then traveling into his brain and killing him almost instantly. This happened when he was fucking 21 years old and he was a seemingly perfectly healthy kid. The reason this was undiagnosed was because his constant “complaints” about his severely engorged calf were of no concern to all the doctors he saw because he was “too young” to have any health issues. They literally told him he must have hurt it working out and sent him home. More than one doctor did this too, it wasn’t just one idiot. I also have many relatives who have experienced strokes and heart attacks, some alive still, some not. Needless to say I don’t take cardiovascular health lightly anymore, especially as someone with extreme obstructive sleep apnea and as someone who walks around with 30-40 pounds more muscle than the average healthy male should. Cardiovascular maintenance is paramount in a bodybuilding/fitness lifestyle with the huge amounts of food we eat, the resistance training which causes ventricular hypertrophy, the excess muscle we carry constantly, among all the other things we do that increases our risk factors. Obviously health as a whole is important, but I have come to realize that having an emphasis on cardiovascular health is the most important of all. I’m going to outline the exact health supplements I use myself, and explain why I use them, and why they don’t suck like the 99% of crap out there. Keep in mind too guys, as part of a bodybuilding lifestyle, it is very typical that while we seemingly “eat clean,” our clean meals usually don’t actually contain vegetables or fruits unless they are serving some sort of purpose like leafy greens for appetite suppression during a cut phase, or fruits post-workout for an insulin spike. I have been very guilty of that, and I’m sure many of you are as well. This is why it is even more important that you get in your vitamins and minerals (that are actually useful). So, what actually is out there that isn’t a colossal waste of money? A Greens Supplement That Actually Contains What You Are Missing/Need  First and foremost, I already know you probably don’t eat enough veggies, I know I don’t. If you do, good on you, but I’m notoriously shitty at regularly eating veggies, and I know a lot of other people that are as well (most people). Because of this, I always have a greens supplement to replace the nutrients I should be getting. One serving per day will be sufficient. My favorite greens supplement is Greens Freak by Pharmafreak.  Delving into why it’s superior in my opinion, first of all, most greens supplements are literally intolerable to drink and literally taste like complete butt hole to put it bluntly. I don’t have too much of an issue with slamming gross shakes (I’ve been doing it for years), but there’s just something about drinking a shake that tastes gross and then seeing green residue everywhere that makes me gag. I blame Kratom for that I guess. Anyways, Greens Freak is bar none the best tasting greens supplement I’ve used, and it definitely has the best nutrient profile bar none. I mix it in with my vanilla whey protein shakes usually nowadays.  Here is a quick breakdown of Green Freak’s many benefits: – Most complete superfoods green formula: Contains the major superfoods barley, wheatgrass, spirulina, and chlorella – Designed for athletes and serious lifters: Greens formula designed specifically for bodybuilding and serious athletes – High amounts of vitamins and enzymes: Contains barley grass and Hawaiian spirulina to give you high amounts of key vitamins and enzymes – Powerful detoxifying agents: Contains wheatgrass to help detoxify your body and organs – Complete immune support: Contains alfalfa grass to offer superior immune support – Actually tastes good I always keep some on hand because I know I will more than likely end up slacking in the vegetable department in my diet.  FOR LIPID HEALTH 1) Citrus Bergamot 1000mg per day This serves one purpose, and that is lowering your bad cholesterol (LDL) and increasing your good cholesterol (HDL). In a study done in 2010 (V. Mollace et al. / Fitoterapia 82 (2011) 309-316) they used a dose of 1000 mg per day and saw decreases in total-Cholesterol of 29%, decreases in LDL-Cholesterol of 34% and corresponding increases of 35% in HDL-Cholesterol. You can read the abstract at: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0367326X10002777 Any Citrus Bergamot product that is cost efficient will serve the same purpose. I get Now Foods Cholesterol Pro Tablets.    2) Psyllium Husk 2-3 teaspoons per day (which will give you 10-15g of fibre) You can adjust the dose depending on how much fibre you get through your diet. But if you barely eat any Vegetables like myself, then this supplement is great. High fiber foods typically only provide one source of fiber. Psyllium Husk powder provides a combination of insoluble and soluble fiber, which will be necessary to maintain optimal digestion, and sweeping bad cholesterol from the digestive tract for greater cardiovascular health. Digestion is actually a huge factor in muscle growth potential that 99% of people don’t even consider either. A high intake of fiber when combined with water also promotes satiety, helping you to feel fuller longer, which makes this stuff great for cutting down as well. I use it for the health benefits mostly though. I use Viva Labs Organic Psyllium Husk Powder.  For Digestive/Gut Health 1) Psyllium Husk falls into this category as well obviously as it greatly helps regulate bowel movements. 2) Tumeric/Curcumin 1200mg per day Curcumin is the main active ingredient in turmeric. It has powerful anti-inflammatory effects and is a very strong antioxidant. In short, it greatly reduces the potential risk of high cholesterol, chronic joint pain, and other chronic inflammation related issues. I use Cree Nutrition’s Tumeric/Curcumin because it includes 95% Curcuminoids and BioPerine, a substance that can enhance the bioavailability of Curcumin by 2000%  3) Probiotic Duo 1 Serving Per Day This stuff is a blessing for surviving cheat meals/days with your stomach in tact. Typically, because I diet pretty hard for long periods of time, I start to get pretty intense cravings that can’t be satisfied by one little treat once per week. So, I’ve been known to have giant gut wrenching cheat days once and a while where I just eat everything remotely resembling junk food in sight. It’s honestly the only way I can totally get rid of the cravings sometimes. When your body has adjusted to eating clean for weeks on end, adding in just a greasy burger with fries and an ice cream cone can be enough to send your digestive system into mayhem. But, try throwing a giant pumpkin pie, a box of glazed donuts, 2 boxes of cookies, some KitKat Chunkies, a tub of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, a pizza, muffins, cake, Fudgeos, brownies, a burger, fries, calamari, a milkshake, a few cheese filled hot dogs, candy, taquitos, and cupcakes at yourself all in one day and then tell me your stomach wouldn’t hurt. I have had some pretty epic cheat days, and they ALWAYS resulted in me sitting on the toilet about every hour or two until I learned about managing my digestive health. My body just couldn’t handle the junk; even one meal of it would be enough to throw my digestive system for a loop because it has become so accustomed to certain types of clean food. So, how this all relates to Probiotics is that taking a Probiotic before a cheat meal can actually facilitate proper digestion, and help you avert having gut wrenching stomach pains all day. Cree Nutrition’s Probiotic Duo contains an advanced pre and probiotic formula that works by promoting growth of beneficial bacteria and crowding out bad bacteria. It requires a significantly smaller dosage and starts acting within hours, not days like most prebiotics. This is obviously optimal for me because I need what I’m taking to do its’ job sooner than later. It promotes proper digestion of dietary fats and complex carbohydrates into beneficial small chain fatty acids such as omega-3 and omega-6, while maintaining healthy levels of cholesterol, glucose and triglycerides. Obviously I’m not saying get a Probiotic so you can binge eat on shitty food all day, rather, I’m saying I suggest getting one as it will help regulate your gut health and promote proper digestion, which is very important on a day to day basis. The helping you get through cheat meals thing is just an added bonus.  For Joint Health 1) Tumeric/Curcumin falls into this category as well as it helps relieve joint pain caused by inflammation 2) Krill Oil Omega-3’s 1000mg per day EPA and DHA are essential fatty acids that the human body can’t make by itself, so it must be ingested from the food we eat, or from supplementation. They are necessary to ensure proper function of your brain, nervous system, and many other basic bodily functions. They also provide anti-inflammatory benefits, improve mood, regulate insulin sensitivity, improve muscle growth, and encourage better sleep. Most individuals don’t eat enough fish (or the right kind) to get the amount of Omega-3’s they need each day to achieve these benefits though, so using a high quality supplement becomes necessary to reap the health benefits of it. I used to take Fish Oil until I found out that Krill oil is a superior source of EPA and DHA because the polyunsaturated fats are packaged as phospholipids, which can be used immediately by your body. The EPA and DHA in fish oil, on the other hand, are typically packaged as triglycerides and have to undergo additional processing in order to make them bioavailable. Krill oil is also more stable because it includes astaxanthin, a powerful antioxidant that protects the fragile fats from oxidizing. Also, it is well known that the global fish populations are much more susceptible to mercury heavy metal poisoning. Krill lie very near the bottom of the food chain and feed primarily on microscopic phytoplankton such as algae. Krill are harvested near Antarctica, far from pollution of mercury and other toxins that fish oil products may contain. Taking too much EPA and DHA can be detrimental since they do cause some blood thinning, and the delicate oils can be inflammatory since they break down so easily, but taking adequate amounts, around 1 gram a day of krill oil will keep your body functioning at 100%. I use Cree Nutrition’s Krill Oil because it contains 500mg Krill oil per soft gel, meaning I only have to take 2 per day (2 x 500mg = 1000mg/1gram) which is great because I already have to take a lot of pills from other health supplements so the less pills to take the better.  Also, Krill Oil is commonly labeled as “Krill Oil” by companies to sell more of it, when in reality it barely contains any Krill Oil in the actual contents, and it is mostly just much cheaper fish oil. Watch out for this when you buy Krill Oil if you use a different company. Heart Health 1) Krill Oil Omega-3’s falls into this category as well as it is scientifically proven to improve cardiovascular health by improving cholesterol levels, increasing good cholesterol, and lowering C-reactive protein levels in the blood 2) Tumeric/Curcumin falls into this category as well as it helps prevent the buildup of plaque in arteries, preventing the onset of atherosclerosis leading to blocked arteries, a stroke, or a heart attack 3) Coenzyme Q10 100mg per day Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is made naturally in the body, but a deficiency in it can lead to heart failure, chest pain, and high blood pressure. CoQ10 maintains a healthy level of bad cholesterol (LDL), supports optimal functioning of the heart muscle and supports the health of vessel walls, all of which play an essential role in longevity, and cardiovascular health in general. CoQ10 may play a role in reducing the number and severity of migraine headaches you get (if you get them). I use Doctor's Best High Absorption Coq10 w/ BioPerine simply because it’s the cheapest option I could find, and the BioPerine helps improve the bioavailability of the CoQ10.  Overall Health 1) Quality Multivitamin A quality Multivitamin is literally the bare minimum you should be taking if you don't want to get any of the other stuff. I use Optimum Nutrition Opti-Men because it is the only Multivitamin that I’ve ever used that I actually noticed a difference in my energy levels after I started taking it. It’s pretty extensive for a basic Multivitamin that goes way beyond what other companies are doing with their Multivitamin products. It has over 75 ingredients, of which 22 are vitamins and essential minerals in actually useful dosages, and has a lot more vitamin D than most competitors.  Honestly, most multi’s usually do their job to an extent so you’d probably be fine using another brand; I just found this one did the best job of the ones I’ve personally tried, and has an impressive nutritional profile, so I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it.  *Optional* Liver Health 1) TUDCA By far the best liver support supplement on earth in my opinion, I decided to throw this into the article for those who may be fond of abusing their livers. Whether it be via frequent alcohol consumption, Accutane use, oral steroid use, or any other medium of introducing something toxic to your liver, I will always suggest taking TUDCA to keep your liver functioning efficiently. All the other stuff like milk thistle, Liv.52, etc. won’t compare in any capacity to the effectiveness of TUDCA. TUDCA will literally chop several hundred off of your AST and ALT liver enzyme lab results in a matter of weeks, bringing your liver back to where it should be. Nutricost TUDCA was the cheapest when I last ordered it, and has the best overall user reviews so I typically go with this one.  In Conclusion As you guys can see, it doesn’t take every vitamin in the store to get what you need, and it certainly does not include taking Vitamins A through Z. I keep it simple, and take what is necessary, and nothing more. The combination of heavy lifting, performance enhancers, and eating tons of food is so damn harsh on the digestive system, lipids, heart and joints/tendons/ligaments that creating a consistent health supplementation plan like the one I outlined above is absolutely necessary. I don’t take supplements based on their proposed benefits, rather, I take the ones I mentioned in particular because I have seen the most data on them proving that they are the most effective at aiding the human body in their respective categories. I hope you guys found this article informative and start taking your health more seriously if you aren’t already. The sooner you start taking it seriously the better. – Derek    Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

    "content": "How To Make A RU58841 5% Solution – Step By Step Guide     RU58841 is a non-steroidal experimental anti-androgen, which is intended for use as a topical treatment for acne and androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness). To briefly describe how it works, it is basically a turn-key all in one hair loss compound that blocks all DHT on the scalp, and can significantly improve the life of anybody experiencing hair loss, and I’m shocked it isn’t more heavily researched. I will be using RU for the rest of my life unless something better gets invented. For the carrier (what the RU58841 raw powder is mixed in), I prefer PG (propylene glycol) + Ethanol. I find it rare for someone’s scalp to be irritated by the PG/Ethanol to the point of needing K&B instead as the carrier. They both work fine; some people just seem to have skin irritation to particular carriers as opposed to others. Keep in mind, in the short-term, it is actually cheaper to buy your solutions pre-mixed already for you. It is only once you have decided that you will be using RU58841 long-term that it becomes more cost effective to invest in the raw powders, and getting the other necessary tools/ingredients to make your own solutions at home. If You Have A Very Hard Time Finding Ethanol If you want to reconstitute your own solutions and can’t find Ethanol by itself (it’s not easy to find) then Anageninc’s K&B solution is your best alternative. It comes in a pre-mixed 50ml bottle mixed with Ethanol, Deionized Water/Demineralized Water, and K&B emulsifiers.  It actually makes research really convenient as if you use the K&B solution you can completely skip over this article, which will outline the process of how to make the RU58841 solution in the typical Ethanol and Propylene Glycol vehicle. All that is required with the K&B solution is to pour your desired amount of RU58841 powder into the premixed K&B solution, then shake lightly until it is thoroughly dissolved and mixed evenly. If you want to mix the standard concentration, use 2.5 grams of raw RU58841 powder in a 50ml K&B solution to achieve a 5% RU58841 solution of 50mg/ml. What You Will Need To Mix Your Own RU58841 Solutions/The Cheapest Long-Term Method  RU58841 Raw Powder   Ethanol (Many People use Everclear (190 proof = 95%) Ethanol)   Propylene Glycol   A Very Accurate Digital Scale   Glass Stirring Rod   2x 50ml Measuring Beakers   50ml+ Bottle To Hold Your RU58841 Solution   A Funnel  The Instructions First thing you want to do is grab a 50ml measuring beaker and fill it up with 35ml of Ethanol. After you’ve done that, turn on your scale and make sure it’s measuring in grams as its’ unit of measurement. Once you see that it’s turned on and at 0 grams, put your other beaker (the empty one) on the scale. After the measurement has stabilized, turn the scale back to 0 with the beaker still on it by pressing the “Tare” button. Once you press this, it will reset the scale to 0 even with the beaker on it. The purpose of this is so we can determine what 2.5 grams of RU5881 powder is without the beaker screwing up our measurement. Add 2.5 grams of powder to the empty beaker on the scale until you see the scale reading 2.5 grams. Once you’ve done that, you can turn off the scale and put it away. Next, pour the 35ml of Ethanol from one beaker into the beaker with the 2.5 grams of RU58841 raw powder. Right after, take that empty beaker you just emptied the Ethanol out of and fill it up with 15ml of Propylene Glycol. The ideal vehicle proportion for an Ethanol and Propylene Glycol RU58841 solution is 70% Ethanol/30% Propylene Glycol (I find it works the best). So no matter how much solution you are using, even if you made a 100 ml solution, you would still want 70% of it to be Ethanol and the other 30% to be Propylene Glycol. For our solution we’re mixing now, it is 50ml so we want 70% (35ml) as Ethanol, and 30% (15ml) as Propylene Glycol. So once you’ve filled up 15ml of Propylene Glycol, pour that into the beaker that has your Ethanol and RU58841 in it. You should now have a cloudy solution of RU58841. All you need to do now is get your glass stirring rod, and stir the solution until it is crystal clear and you can’t see any fragments of unmixed RU58841 powder in it. If you are stirring for a while and can’t seem to get it to completely mix, simply add a few more millilitres of Ethanol and Propylene Glycol to the solution to dilute it a bit more (remembering to use 70% of what you’re adding as Ethanol, and 30% of what you’re adding as Propylene Glycol). Once it’s crystal clear your solution is ready to go, and you can get your funnel and 50ml+ RU58841 container and pour the solution through the funnel into the empty bottle you have to store your solution in. There you have it, now you have a 50ml+ 5% RU58841 solution dosed at 50mg/ml. Store it in the fridge out of the light ideally to maximize the shelf life and prevent any degradation to the solution. Room temperature is the least ideal scenario, but if you don’t have a fridge you can store it in, then at least make sure it’s in a cool, dry place, out of direct light when you’re storing it at room temperature. Raw powder should always be stored in the freezer.

    "date": "2016-09-01T06:49:59+00:00",
    "content": "Sleep Apnea – The Real Reason Why So Many Bodybuilders Are Dying     You may or may not have heard of Sleep Apnea before. Whether you have or you haven’t, if health is a concern for you in any capacity I suggest you give this article a read. The Silent Killer  What Is Sleep Apnea? Sleep Apnea is a common disorder that occurs during your sleep that causes you to intermittently stop breathing in your sleep. Breathing pauses can last anywhere from a few seconds, to a couple minutes. Yes you read that right; with Sleep Apnea it isn’t completely unheard of to stop breathing for over a minute. This can occur dozens of times per hour, making up several hundred “apneas” over the course of your sleep cycle each night. What About Steroids? I Thought Those Were The Killers Of Bodybuilders? Okay let’s set the record straight. Steroids CAN be potentially unhealthy if you don’t use them properly. However, the real danger comes from the side effects that steroids can produce and exacerbate if your health isn’t in check. For example, if you are on heavy doses of gear and your diet also sucks ass, then you will bloat several times as much as you would if you weren’t on steroids and your diet sucked ass. As a result, you will likely have an increased resting heart rate, increased blood viscosity, and high blood pressure. These over the span of several years will likely lead to cardiovascular complications, however, steroids themselves don’t instantly just wreak havoc like poison in your body. It is a long term snowball effect of neglecting your general health, coupled with steroids which exacerbate other poor lifestyle choices. So How Does This All Relate To Sleep Apnea and Bodybuilding? I mentioned cardiovascular issues being a snowball effect over several years already. One thing that goes completely unconsidered by many individuals is the fact that weighing more than the average human weighs will have just as much of a strain on your heart as any heavy cycle of gear. There is a reason you don’t see many 300 pound 70+ year olds walking around, or even 50+ year olds for that matter. This is because when you are carrying more weight, that is more tissue your heart has to supply blood and oxygen to. When your heart has to work harder to make all this extra body mass function, you are stressing out your cardiovascular system, and are severely diminishing your potential lifespan. If you look through the course of history of bodybuilding, the guys that usually pass away the youngest are either guys that abused the hell out of drugs and neglected their health, or the mass monsters who walked around at 300 pounds for several consecutive years. Not only that, but your heart has to work several times as hard to supply blood and oxygen to 300 pounds of muscle than it does to supply blood and oxygen to an average 300 pound overweight guy. Both scenarios are unbelievably unhealthy, but another unconsidered fact in bodybuilding is that simply exceeding your genetic potential of lean muscle mass is going to start having a negative effect on your cardiovascular function, because your heart has to go into overdrive to supply oxygen and blood to this supraphysiological amount of lean muscle mass.  The more muscle mass, the harder your heart has to work. Being Heavy And Sleep Apnea So we’ve already established how being heavy can have a direct and immensely negative effect on your cardiovascular function, but we haven’t talked about how being heavy correlates with Sleep Apnea. In adults, the most common cause of obstructive Sleep Apnea is excess weight and obesity. Excess weight is directly associated with the soft tissue of the mouth and throat causing airway blockages during the sleep cycle, as if you are excessively heavy it is very likely you have a thicker than average neck. Now you may be saying, “this doesn’t apply to me, I’m heavy but I’m ripped and jacked so this doesn’t apply to me!” Think again. Even if you’re 220 pounds of solid muscle, your neck size and overall weight is substantially bigger and higher than the average healthy male that is Sleep Apnea free. You fall into the same category of at-risk individuals even if you are ripped to shreds, if you are “overweight”. As mentioned previously, being overweight (even if it’s comprised of mostly muscle) will lead to insane amounts of cardiovascular stress, and then compound that multiple times with the hell your heart endures every single night from Sleep Apnea, and you are a ticking time bomb waiting to have a heart attack or stroke. That my friends, is the reason why bodybuilders are dying so young. Weighing more than a healthy human should, drugs compounding the issues which are left unaddressed by most, and worst of all the Sleep Apnea making everything 100x worse. My Experience With Sleep Apnea I didn’t even know I had Sleep Apnea until I bulked up to 250 pounds for the first time. It was my most intense bulk phase of all time, pushing my weight all the way up to 250 from 170-180. As my weight climbed, I noticed I was having an incredibly difficult time staying awake in my university classes, I would commonly doze off in the middle of the day no matter where I was, I would wake up gasping for air with my heart beating out of my chest, and there were even times I had a very hard time staying awake at the wheel while driving.  Needless to say, it was getting very severe and dangerous. I recall once I was at the club with my friends and I actually fell asleep at our table. No I wasn’t drinking, I was bone dry sober. My Sleep Apnea was simply so bad that no matter when I went to sleep, I would apnea so frequently and so intensely that my body never actually got into REM sleep or a deep sleep of any capacity, so even if I slept for 8+ hours, it would only feel like maybe half an hour of rest. I was a walking zombie. The reason why it got so much worse was because as I got heavier, my neck got thicker, and my airway was getting blocked more and more while I slept. Coupled with the fact that I was already breathing a lot harder from carrying all this excess weight on my physique, it made for a disastrous combination. My parents started noticing that I was choking in my sleep, and started recording me at night time. We were shocked and frightened to listen back to the tapes. I would literally stop breathing for over a minute and then gasp desperately for air hundreds of times every single night. I went to see a sleep specialist and he determined I have “Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea” after giving me an overnight sleep test. His exact words to me were “you would have had a major stroke and probably died before turning 30 if you didn’t seek treatment for this.” Yes, it’s that serious guys. Think about holding your breath for as long as you can until you’re about to pass out and how stressful that is on your body. Then imagine your body doing that in your sleep hundreds of times per night, every single night. It will undoubtedly diminish your lifespan at a quick rate. Why Is Sleep Apnea A “Silent Killer?” The reason Sleep Apnea is so unheard of and I dub it “the silent killer” is because you may have no clue that you are suffering from it. This is because if you sleep by yourself, you will have nobody there to notice you are choking or intermittently ceasing to breathe in your sleep. And even if you sleep with someone beside you, they may sleep through your apneas, or just assume you’re a bad snorer and write it off as something normal. I would estimate that 50% of bodybuilders and other overweight individuals probably have Sleep Apnea to some degree and don’t even know it. I wouldn't be surprised if it was an even higher percentage than that though, that is just my guess. Mine only became noticeable to my family once I started gaining lots of weight, but I’ve always had it. It simply took an extreme bodybuilding regimen that involved me gaining way too much weight for my symptoms to get exacerbated to the point that it was blatantly obvious I had this sleep disorder. Common Symptoms Of Sleep Apnea To Look For:  Waking up with a very sore or dry throat Loud snoring Occasionally waking up with a choking or gasping sensation Sleepiness or lack of energy during the day Sleepiness while driving Morning headaches Restless sleep Forgetfulness, mood changes, and a decreased interest in sex Recurrent awakenings or insomnia  If you have any of these, I highly recommend you see a sleep specialist and get an overnight sleep test done just in case. Left Untreated, Sleep Apnea Can Cause Serious, Potentially Life-Threatening Conditions Such As:  Heart Attack Stroke High blood pressure Mood disorders (anxiety, depression) Sexual dysfunction Inability to lose weight Reduced enjoyment of life Motor vehicle accidents  Treatment For Sleep Apnea And Is There A Cure? While some individuals with less intense cases of Sleep Apnea may be able to cure themselves by simply bringing their bodyweight down, or with surgeries that open their airway up more (deviated septum fixes, surgically pulling jaw forward to make more space in the airway, etc.), those aren’t guaranteed cures. One thing that pisses me off is that there are several gimmicky products on the market that take advantage of the fear of losing one’s health to sell their products. Don’t fall for BS marketers who want to prey on your fears to sell you shitty useless products. There is only one thing I would EVER recommend to those with Sleep Apnea, and that is the CPAP machine. CPAP Machine = The Best Current Treatment Of Sleep Apnea Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is a common treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. It includes a small machine that supplies a constant and steady air pressure, a hose, and a mask or nose piece. Basically what this machine does is it keeps oxygen in your airway at all times so then you never stop breathing in your sleep.  The pressure will adjust itself while you are asleep as well if it recognizes that you need more oxygen, or if you don’t need as much as it is pushing out, and then re-calibrates itself to push the exact amount of oxygen you need into your airway. I have been using a CPAP machine religiously now for 4 years and it has literally been a night and day difference in my quality of life. Now a full 8 hours of sleep actually equates to 8 hours of real rest, and I can function like a human being again! And also even more importantly, I don’t have to worry about my heart going to war every single night now and having my cardiovascular system undergo vicious levels of stress and damage each and every day. Will A CPAP Machine Get Rid Of My Snoring? Yes, using a CPAP machine will not only 100% protect you from Sleep Apnea, but it will also prevent you from snoring if you are a snorer. If You Have Sleep Apnea, I STRONGLY URGE YOU To Address It ASAP And Get A CPAP Machine. Go get a prescription from a sleep specialist, and see if your insurance will cover your CPAP machine. If your insurance won’t cover it, or you don’t have insurance, save up your money and buy one without a prescription. I’m telling you right now, if you have Sleep Apnea it isn’t even a question of whether it is a feasible cost in your life, you absolutely need to find the money and get this thing. I would likely be dead in a couple years if I didn’t get one (or already dead), and I shake my head in disbelief when I hear of my buddies with Sleep Apnea who refuse to wear their mask because they don’t like having to wear a mask to bed at night. I even have a charged up mini-generator for my CPAP machine if the power ever goes out and I need an energy source to plug my machine into.  Click HERE For The Mini-Generator I Keep On Hand Just In Case  The lifespan of CPAP machines are over 10 years if you treat them well and keep them well maintained, so it isn’t too much out of pocket when you consider how long 1 machine can last. I’ve been using the same machine since it was prescribed to me years ago and it still works good as new. So Where Can You Get A CPAP Machine And What’s The Best Model Right Now? What Else Do I Need With My CPAP Machine?  If you are forced to go the route of paying for it out of pocket, you can find the best models for the cheapest prices online from CPAP re-sellers who buy them at wholesale, and then resell them for reasonable rates, as opposed to big corporations who will charge you literally twice as much for the same machine. I find that Amazon actually has the most reasonable prices for CPAP machines and other necessary accessories. Right now, this is the best CPAP machine available in my opinion: Respironics DreamStation Auto CPAP With Humidifier And Heated Tubing  This model is about 50% quieter than the previous model, and has a whole lot of other nifty features. I don’t care a lot about those features to be honest, but this is bar none the best bang for your buck right now. It auto-adjusts the pressure while you sleep, it will last a decade or longer if you store it well, and it runs like a dream (it doesn’t roar like a lawnmower while you’re sleeping either like some lower quality CPAP machines do). You can get this CPAP model by clicking HERE Respironics DreamStation Ultra-Fine Filters    You will need these to filter the air you are breathing. You should dispose of it after 30 days of use per filter. They cannot be washed and re-used like the pollen filters that you will also need with your CPAP machine. A cool thing about the Respironics DreamStation Auto CPAP machine above is that the device has an automatic air filter reminder. Every 30 days it will display a message reminding you to check your filters and replace them as directed. You can get the filters you will need by clicking HERE Respironics DreamStation Filter – Pollen  You will also need a couple of these filters. They attach to the ultra-fine filters in your CPAP machine. To clean the reusable blue pollen filter, first detach the light-blue ultra-fine filter if applicable, and set aside or dispose of as needed. Then take the reusable filter to the sink, turn it upside down, and run warm tap water through the white filter media to rinse away any debris. Next, lightly shake the filter to remove as much water as possible. Allow the filter to air dry completely before reinstalling it. If the re-usable blue pollen filter is torn, replace it. You can get the necessary pollen filter by clicking HERE ResMed AirFit F10 Full Face System (Pick the size that fits your face of course)  This is the mask I recommend using if you are a mouth breather like myself. I find that size medium fits the majority of individuals. You can get this model of mask by clicking HERE Pilario Q Nasal Pillows Mask (If You Prefer A Nasal Mask)  If you aren’t a mouth breather like me and would prefer a nasal only mask, then I recommend this mask. You can get this model of mask by clicking HERE How To Use Your CPAP Machine? It is as simple as connecting the pieces, fitting the mask around your face, turning it on, and then going to sleep.  It will do all the work for you, and adjust the air pressure as needed to provide you with the optimal amount of oxygen you need to totally stop your Sleep Apnea, keep you healthy and safe, and prevent all snoring. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this machine literally saved my life, and I highly suggest you invest in one if you have been diagnosed with Sleep Apnea. If you suspect you have Sleep Apnea, or the symptoms I mentioned of Sleep Apnea are symptoms you currently experience, I urge you to go get a Sleep Apnea test done ASAP. Stay healthy guys. 🙂 – Derek  Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

    "content": "My Top 10 Most Complimented Colognes/Fragrances     Most of my subscribers don’t know this but I’m kind of a fragrance fanatic. Some people collect baseball cards, some people collect rare video games, me, I collect colognes and fragrances. Well, only good ones.  There is no better way to instantly boost your attractiveness to women than to smell damn amazing. While many guys think that how they smell is a small and insignificant detail, think about it this way. You’re in bed with a 10/10 girl and you go in to kiss her and you get a giant whiff of body odor.  As opposed to: You’re in bed with a 10/10 girl and you go in to kiss her and you get a gentle whiff of a gorgeous floral blend of vanilla, caramel, and other intoxicating feminine smells that make you go crazy.  Ya. The second scenario is far more appealing. Obviously that is an extreme polar opposite example, but I know you have all noticed that a girl who smells fantastic will always stand out to you, and if she’s attractive it will just make her have an even greater edge. The EXACT same applies to men for women. Perhaps even more so. Women aren’t as visually driven as men are. By this I mean if we see a tight toned body girl with a nice face we are ready to go and there is nothing more that needs to be done for us to determine we would sleep with them. For women though, there are more intimate details that don’t apply as strictly to men. They are much more in tuned with their senses and when a guy smells fantastic, you better believe that it will be a huge turn on for a woman, and she will likely even remember you for that specific scent in the future. TIP #1: Next time you’re sleeping over at a girl’s house, spray her pillow with a couple spritzes of your cologne before you leave. This will have her remembering you and thinking about you every time she is near her bed even when you aren’t there.  I used to not think having a solid fragrance for dates was that important, until I was bought a bottle of Armani Code in 2011 for a Christmas present. I started using it simply because I had it, not because I thought it would make a difference. Holy hell was I ever wrong. The compliments I would get on dates and out with women in general went through the roof! Smelling great almost becomes like a topic of conversation for women who don’t even know you to feel comfortable engaging you as well. It isn’t uncommon for a girl who doesn’t even know to get a whiff of your cologne and then turn to you and say, “you smell amazing/great/sexy/phenomenal/whatever” and then an entire conversation can start up between you two just based on that. It is really quite incredible. And with girls who already know you…. Forget about it. Smelling great is SOOOOOO KEY! After this, I became a fragrance junkie. I actually found it fun to go on the basenotes forum (huge fragrance online discussion forum) and fragrantica and look up reviews, talk about up and coming releases, and shoot the shit in general. Kind of a waste of time, but it was like a hobby for me. There are definitely some fragrances that are more mass appealing and cater to a larger variety of social settings, and these are more appropriate for individuals who don’t want to own more than 1 or 2 colognes. However, I became obsessed with getting the BEST fragrance for each possible scenario I was in. Whether I was in a hot climate during the day time, whether I was out for a night on the town, whether I was working my bouncer gig in my dress clothes at the club, whether I was on a date, whatever situation arose, I wanted to have the best possible fragrance for the scenario. While this is pretty overkill for most, luckily many of the fragrances that made it into my list are not only great for particular situations, but many overlap into other categories and are just fantastic overall fragrances. I’m not necessarily an expert when it comes to identifying all the top notes, middle notes, base notes, in different fragrances like most of the fragrance junkies love to analyze. But what I did care about (and what mattered for the most part) was which fragrance lasted a long time once applied, how far did the scent project away from my body after applying it, and what were women’s reactions and opinions on the scents themselves. After about 5 years of dating a significant amount of women, I have narrowed down my top 10 most complimented fragrances. This list isn’t based on the opinions of just a few women; it is based on all compliments I have received over the span of my entire dating life while wearing fragrances (I have never gone on a date without a fragrance on for the past 5 years, so yes it’s a large sample group). The list will start at #10, being the 10th most complimented fragrance I’ve ever worn, moving all the way down the list until we reach my number 1 most complimented fragrance of all time. So without further adieu, let’s begin: #10: Salvatore Ferragamo F Black: http://amzn.to/2bhmPef This cologne is a love or hate fragrance.  With the majority loving it though being the key. It is VERY strong, with an insane level of longevity and projection. It screams masculinity and definitely isn’t a fragrance for your average teeny bopper kid in high school looking for his first cologne. It is almost like a peppery version of La Nuit De L’homme, with a bit more edge and masculinity. One of the main pros of this fragrance is not only that it is strong and lasts a long time, but it is also very cheap. The best situation for this fragrance would be in the Winter months outdoors. It cuts through the harsh cold amazingly, and is strong enough that even when you’re going for a walk with your girl through the snow she can still get intermittent whiffs of it. Typically, I only wore this when I was bouncing at night time in the Winter and had to stand outside the club manning the ropes at the front and ID’ing people, or when I would go on outdoor dates. It can be worn indoors as well, but be weary of how much you spray yourself with it if indoors. It can be slightly cloying if over applied. I’d say it is probably the most “manly” fragrance on this list. #9: Perry Ellis 360 Red: http://amzn.to/2bIywu3 This is another cheap cologne that is worth far more than it costs.  If you have ever smelled Acqua Di Gio it is easiest to sum up 360 Red as an Acqua Di Gio clone, except it performs better, lasts longer, and costs less than half the price. This fragrance is fantastic for everyday use, for the office, for dates, for going to the grocery store, for anything really. It is very versatile, and it works well in all seasons as well. I have gone through about four 200ml bottles of this stuff in the past 4 years. That is how damn good it is. #8: Armani Code Profumo: http://amzn.to/2bBPBZ5 This beast is the reincarnation of the old school Armani Code Original.  Armani Code Original is the first cologne I ever owned, and I still remember how much my dating life changed once I started wearing it out on dates. Compliment city! I had never been complimented on my scent before (because I never smelled like anything), so obviously it was all a very new thing to me. I still vividly remember one of the first truly gorgeous girls I ever slept with texting me later in the day after I left her house telling me how her bed still smelled like me and she couldn’t get me out of her head. Mission accomplished. I think the best compliment I ever got with this cologne was when a girl literally grabbed me and shoved her nose into my chest and said: “You smell like God!” Needless to say, I have always had a place in my heart (and on my shelf) for this fragrance after that crazy year where this scent was my go to. Armani Code Profumo is the newest rendition of the original Armani Code, and it is even stronger than the original. Perhaps almost too strong depending on how your skin holds onto scents. You can easily expect 10 hours plus of strong projection from this stuff, and over applying it is definitely not recommended. The Profumo version definitely still smells like the original, but they changed the DNA around and added another few notes that are very sweet and almost edible smelling. Personally, I liked the original scent a bit better, but I have been rolling with Profumo lately and it still seems to be doing the job, and I only have to spray half as much because it performs so well longevity wise. #7: Versace Eros: http://amzn.to/2bBOb0Y The best club fragrance you may have never heard of.  This stuff is very potent smelling and the best way to describe it is it is one of the best club fragrances you can possibly wear (if that makes any sense, it probably doesn’t). It cuts through the crowd nicely, it is very sexy, women love it, and it oozes of one night stand alpha male. I don’t know how else to explain this one. I always have this on hand for a party, a clubbing night out, or a late night date on the town. #6: Nautica Voyage: http://amzn.to/2by8I7z This is arguably the best cheap fragrance ever created.  It is very affordable, with 100 ml only costing around $14. I ALWAYS have a bottle of this in my collection, and if I’m running out I will order another one without question. It is a perfect scent for summer time, or the daytime in general. It has mass appeal with women and it is a very, very safe choice. I have yet to encounter one single person who doesn’t like this fragrance a lot. The performance is good, it is versatile as hell, it is insanely cheap, and all women love it. You can’t go wrong with Nautica Voyage. #5: Christian Dior Sauvage: http://amzn.to/2bICLpl I’m sure a lot of you guys have seen the commercials for this stuff in the past year with Johnny Depp endorsing this stuff.  Honestly, I don’t particularly like the smell of this fragrance personally, but for whatever reason Women GO APE SHIT OVER IT! I’m not exaggerating. This is one of those fragrances that smells incredibly mainstream and synthetic, but women seem to universally just drool over it. It is a great everyday scent and can be worn in mostly any situation. The projection and longevity are very strong with this stuff as well so you can expect that a bottle will last you a while. Only a few spritzes are needed. If this list was based on MY top 10 rated fragrances, this one wouldn’t even make it onto it, but obviously I wear what appeals to women, not men, so even if I think a fragrance smells like 10 pounds of horse shit, if 99% of women think it smells like an intoxicating aphrodisiac, then I’d wear it anyways. Now, this stuff certainly doesn’t smell like shit, but I think it’s pretty synthetic like I said, so if you are looking for something that will help you with the ladies this would be a GREAT option, but if you are looking for a fragrance that you like the smell of yourself, you may not be the biggest fan of Dior Sauvage. #4: L'homme Yves Saint Laurent By Yves Saint Laurent: http://amzn.to/2by7yZN This is probably the most pleasant smelling male fragrance I’ve ever smelled in my entire life.  It is almost unisex smelling it is so pleasant, but it has just enough masculinity to be obviously a men’s fragrance. It is a softer scent, playful and just makes you happy when you smell it. It has the same effect when women smell it on you, and it is the ultimate fragrance choice for having a girl over to your place in the day time, or sleeping over and cooking breakfast in the morning and lounging around the house, or going to meet your girlfriend’s family. Basically, any situation where you need something safe that just smells great, this is a very solid choice. It doesn’t smell favoured to any particular season or weather conditions either which makes it perfect for any time of the year. It is my go to “close encounters” day time indoor fragrance at all times of the year (yes I overanalyze the shit out of fragrances for specific situations, but if you own a butt ton of them then you tend to do that). #3: The One By Dolce and Gabbana: http://amzn.to/2bBM7WR This is bar none the SEXIEST men's fragrance I have ever smelled in my life.  It literally somehow just smells like the sexiest male scent possible. There aren’t many words that can describe this stuff except that it is an AMAZING date scent, it is versatile and can be worn year round, although it is favoured towards the Fall and Winter months, and it is literally just straight up sex in a bottle. The only downside of this fragrance which is why it is only number 3 on my list is that its’ projection and longevity aren’t very good. It needs several re-applications throughout the day to make it last well, and it doesn’t project very far either. It becomes a skin scent rather quickly which means that you literally have to be a an inch or less from the spot sprayed to smell it once it fades into a skin scent. If they could reformulate this to be more powerful, I have no doubt that this would be my #1. However, it is still so ridiculously sexy and has gotten me so much positive feedback that despite it being weak in the performance category, it still claims the #3 spot. #2: Carolina Herrera CH Men Prive: http://amzn.to/2bdFTrJ There are too many good things to say about this fragrance I won’t even attempt to.  It is incredibly sexy, it smells masculine, it is versatile in that it can be worn everyday, but it also excels in an amazing way on a date. It is definitely one of my go to date scents, and it never fails to get plenty of amazing compliments and reactions. It’s not super strong, but it’s strong enough. This works in your favour on dates anyways as you will probably be up close and personal with a woman and don’t want to have an overpowering fragrance on. The only difference between this one and my #1 is how soft they are. CH Men Prive is more masculine, while La Nuit De L’homme could be identified as a tad softer/metrosexual. Personally, I like the more masculine vibe as it works with my personality and style better, however, there is no denying which I got more compliments with. CH Men Original and CH Men Prive remain my favourite date scents right now personally, but they are my #2 most complimented. #1: Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit De L'homme: http://amzn.to/2bIx3Ux Heaven in a bottle.  Sexy, sensual, soft but still masculine, it will literally have girls you are with raving about how insanely good you smell. This is the ultimate date fragrance. And even if you don’t necessarily think it’s the best, trust me, WOMEN DO. There are a few other fragrances on my list which I personally like the scent of better, but this fragrance is definitely my number 1 compliment getter, and has gotten my best overall results. It doesn’t have great performance, but in the close intimate settings it works just fine, and the scent is definitely a panty dropper. Arguably the God of all fragrances, I will ALWAYS have a bottle of this in my collection. TIP #2: Get a few travel atomizers: http://amzn.to/2bMBzkB  These bad boys are basically mini cologne bottles and you can fill them up to make inconspicuous travel cologne bottles so when you’re on a date and your fragrance starts to get weak or die out, you can go to the washroom and quickly reapply your fragrance and be fresh wherever you are, whenever you want. I never go on a date without one of these in my pocket.  After 5 years of working through many different fragrances and dating hundreds of women, this is my Top 10 list of most complimented fragrances. I hope you guys like it, and reconsider how important smelling great can be on taking your appeal to the next level.

It is very protein dense, and the fiber and fats will help fill you up and stave off cravings. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YzHpIcCwAQ Blend the following:   1/3 cup quick oats 2 tablespoons Nutracleanse (fiber supplement, can use flax seed as a replacement) 1 whole egg (free range) Dash of almond milk 1 scoop of your favorite flavor of Isopure Whey Protein Isolate   Preheat pan on medium (spray it with PAM if you need to to make sure the pancakes don’t stick to the pan). Flip early. Creates 2-3 small-medium sized pancakes Topping: Add the following once cooked  Walden Farms Calorie Free Pancake Syrup Heat up 1/4 cup of blueberries or place into batter while cooking  Macronutrient Breakdown: 500 calories, 45 grams protein, 44 grams carbs (14 of which are pure fibre), 16 grams fat Now, this is the most delicious, but still diet friendly version of this pancake, however, you can definitely make an even stricter version of it for more restrictive cutting diets. How To Alter This Recipe For Individuals Who Are On VERY Strict Cutting Diets When I am dieting down and my calorie restriction doesn’t allow me to fit 500 calories in for this meal, or I simply need a more favorable macronutrient distribution calorie/protein/carb/fat wise, I will take away the whole egg, the fruit, and the Nutracleanse. This makes it not taste as delicious, but it’s still pretty damn good considering how nicely it can fit into even the most strict of diets. Definitely beats re-heated frozen plain chicken breasts! I will add another scoop of protein to it too sometimes to help meet my protein goals for the day if needed. These ingredients are a guideline and you can play around with them to meet your macro goals per day. My favorite very strict version of this pancake is simply 1/3 cup of quick oats, and 1.5 scoops chocolate or vanilla Isopure, and then enough almond milk for it to be just mixable enough to blend it into pancake batter consistency (a bit more than a few dashes of almond milk). This makes 2 medium-large sized pancakes.  The more oats and protein you add the more liquid you will need to blend it up in obviously. If you are insanely strict you can even mix it with water (I’ve done this before and it still tastes very good). The macros of that come out to 334 calories, 42 grams protein, 32 grams carbs, and 2 grams fat.

S4, also known as Andarine (not to be confused with S-40503), is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) originally developed by developed by GTx, Inc. with the intention of treating a variety of degenerative musculoskeletal diseases and benign prostatic hypertrophy. It was also being evaluated for its potential therapeutic applications in males and females for modulation of fertility, erythropoiesis, osteoporosis, sexual libido and in men with or at high risk for prostate cancer. It is orally bioavailable (no injections needed), non-steroidal and has tissue-selective anabolic effects in muscle and bone, while sparing other androgenic effects that come from anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS). Testosterone and DHT are the main endogenous androgens produced in the body that fulfill basic physiological functions in men. They are essential for male development, as well as the maintenance of male secondary characteristics. The ability to build muscle, maintain bone mineral density, among several other key processes are facilitated via these hormones, but they are inherently flawed by their lack of tissue selectivity. DHT is several-fold more androgenic than Testosterone, and even in the absence of DHT if 5-alpha reduction is manually inhibited with a drug like Finasteride or Dutasteride, Testosterone itself only exhibits a 2:1 selectivity for muscle to prostate [R, R].  The effects of these two androgens are transcribed and executed predominantly through the androgen receptor. While they fulfill necessary physiological functions in the body, their very presence often induces a variety of negative health consequences too due to their androgenicity. Just some of these include a dose dependent increased risk of prostatic hypertrophy, unhealthy serum lipids, and cardiovascular disease. The scope of anabolic androgenic steroid use in a clinical setting to treat degenerative musculoskeletal diseases is extremely limited too, as their androgenicity disqualifies them from being viable treatment options for women entirely, and men in many cases too. Consequently, the need in modern medicine for anabolic agents that exhibit a complete selectivity for muscle and bone with a lack of stimulation in the prostate and other negatively affected androgen sensitive tissues was/still is very high. In general, SARMs exhibit much greater androgen receptor specificity, oral bioavailability, and tissue selectivity than steroids. At a time, S4 was one of the lead candidates in the scope of promising SARMs, being described as the ideal SARM due to once per day dosing, high level of bioavailability, and the significant amount of preclinical data exhibiting a desirable level of anabolic effects in muscle and bone relative to androgenic activity [R]. It is less potent in both anabolic and androgenic effects than other SARMs that were developed like Ostarine and LGD-4033. Andarine was eventually abandoned and didn't undergo any published phase 1 human clinical trials. We can only guess why this was, but it was more likely than not its lack of potency relative GTx's current lead candidate (Ostarine). Even if Andarine went on to human trials, it almost undoubtedly would have been discontinued anyways due to the night vision side effect that likely disqualifies it as a viable treatment option. Mechanism Of Action S4 acts as a full androgen receptor agonist in muscle tissue and a partial agonist in the prostate [R]. The in-vitro activity of S4 demonstrated high androgen receptor binding affinity (Ki=7.5 nM). It is rapidly absorbed following oral dosing and peaks in the blood stream between 48-84 min [R]. It exerts tissue-specific anabolic effects in vivo, with a favorable selectivity for muscle and bone to prostate and seminal vesicles. After binding to the androgen receptor S4 exerts tissue-specific anabolic effects in vivo in a dose dependent manner by inhibiting bone turnover, stimulating bone formation and building muscle mass, while stimulating prostate and seminal vesicles to a much lesser extent [R, R]. S4 Effects Increases Muscle Mass With High Selectivity   S4 Versus Testosterone Propionate Study   The anabolic activity of S4 is much more selective than Testosterone, and is accomplished with a relatively minor effect on prostate size, and other androgen affected tissues (like hair follicles).  Treatment of castrated rats with S4 (GTX-007) showed greater anabolic activity than rats treated with Testosterone Propionate. The levator ani muscle maintained the same weight as intact control rats and was greater the same dose of Testosterone achieved. What this demonstrates is that milligram:milligram, Andarine more potent than Testosterone when it comes to building muscle (at the dosages tested), and it was able to prevent muscle wasting with greater efficacy than Testosterone, with far less prostate stimulation. When an animal is castrated, its endogenous androgen levels plummet because it is no longer capable of producing them through the main mechanism by which the body facilitates it. Consequently, prostate weight, seminal vesicle weight and muscle weight all plummet in parallel to the crashing androgen levels (hence why low Testosterone in men causes loss of muscle tissue). This allows scientists to administer exogenous androgens and SARMs to evaluate how potently and selectively they transcribe their anabolic effects in the animal body, as the ideal SARM with optimal selectivity would restore muscle weight (levator ani) to that of a healthy intact control animal with normal endogenous androgen production, but prostate weight would not be stimulated whatsoever and would remain the weight of castrated control rats. S4 doesn't accomplish this, but it's one of the closest to accomplishing it [R]. This was one of the first experiments ever conducted in-vivo that demonstrated the efficacy and selective nature of SARMs. In this study S4 (GTX-007) selectively promoted prostate weight to 33.8% and levator ani muscle weight to 101% of intact control, while Testosterone Propionate (TP) non-selectively increased prosate weight to 121% and levator ani muscle weight to 104% of intact control. At the time, S4 was the most efficacious SARM in development and revealed some of the most promising preclinical data of a SARM demonstrating potent anabolic effects with less androgenic activity than naturally produced endogenous androgens.   S4 Versus DHT Study   In another study where S4 is compared to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), S4 restored levator ani and soleus muscle mass post-castration, and skeletal muscle strength was also restored to intact levels [R]. Male Sprague Dawley rats were castrated and left alone for 12 weeks to allow maximum decrease in soleus muscle mass and strength to occur. They were then treated with either 3 mg/kg of S4, 10 mg/kg of S4, 3 mg/kg of DHT, or nothing (vehicle) for 8 weeks. S4 selectively restored the tissue weight loss that occurred after castration.  As seen in the chart above, S4 exhibited a dose dependent increase in androgenic activity, however, the ratio of its anabolic activity relative to its androgenic activity is far more favorable than DHT. It is not absent of prostate stimulation, but it has a far better efficacy profile than DHT does, which just so happens to be one of the two main hormones humans endogenously rely on for androgen mediated functions. At a dose of 3 mg/kg/day, S4 restored prostate weight to less than 20% of the intact level. The intact level is the weight of the rat prostate based on stimulation from their own endogenous natural hormone production (Testosterone and DHT). The 3 mg/kg/day dose of S4 fully restored the levator ani muscle to control level. This means that the dosage required to replicate the anabolic-related therapeutic benefits fulfilled by Testosterone and DHT that the body endogenously produces can be accomplished by a dose of S4 that only stimulates prostate growth enough to sustain 20% of its natural level. While it isn't totally absent of androgenic activity, the fact that prostate weight can drop by -80% and 100% of muscle mass can be maintained at that dosage exhibits just how much potential this SARM has for potential applications in treating muscle and bone wasting diseases in men and women, reversing prostate hypertrophy, and HRT. Strength levels were also restored to that of intact levels as well [R].    Tissue Selectivity Of S4 In Intact Rats Study   This was the first study that assessed the pharmacological effects of S-4 in intact rats [R].  Both S1 and S4 demonstrated partial agonist activity in the androgenic tissues (prostate) and full agonist activity in muscle (levator ani muscle) in both castrated and intact rats [R]. However, in castrated rats, prostate weight dropped down far lower than in the intact rat group. This implies that S4 may actually be more androgenic than implied by the castration models. Prostate weight only dropped about 20% in intact rats, and while the levator ani muscle in this group actually went to slightly suraphysiological levels, the ideal candidate would drop prostate size to castration vehicle levels while maintaining 100% therapeutic anabolism. Perhaps the study length isn't long enough to make an accurate assessment, as castration causes prostate weight to plummet, and S4 administration at “therapeutic” levels doesn't increase the weight above 40% of the intact vehicle control while simultaneously restoring anabolic activity to 100%, but S4 in intact rats only decreases prostate size by about 20%. If S4 were to be used in a therapeutic context, patients would not be castrated prior to using it, so the intact rat model sheds a bit more light on what is realistic to expect from this compound at a low dosage. Perhaps if it was used for a longer duration of time, prostate size would have continued to drop, although that would need to be determined by further testing. I would be interested to see if there was a middle ground where the castrated group and intact group on S4 would eventually meet, equal out and plateau in regards to androgenic activity. Another more likely possibility is that the dosage of S4 used was just not high enough to yield as much of a prostate weight decrease as would be ideal. As the dosage of S4 increases, further suppression of Testosterone, and consequently DHT, would occur, thereby reducing prostate size more and more until a middle ground is reached between endogenous androgen suppression induced prostate weight decrease, and Andarine's inherent prostate stimulation effects, which is more likely representative in the castrated rat models. Reduces Prostate Size Androgen suppression with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and anti-androgens are two of the main treatments for benign prostate hyperplasia. Based on Andarine's partial agonistic activity in the prostate relative to full agonistic activity in lean muscle tissue, investigating whether it could be used as an alternative treatment for benign prostate hyperplasia was desirable [R].  S1 is another SARM that was assessed in this study as well. 0.5 mg per day of S1 or S4 were given to the treated rats, and compared to castrated and intact rats who were treated with either nothing, or 0.5 mg per day of Testosterone Propionate. While S1 and S4 both showed similar selectivity, milligram:milligram, S4 was a more potent agonist of muscle and less suppressive than S1 [R]. While this is desirable for certain treatment options (like HRT), when it comes to treating benign prostate hyperplasia, the goal is suppressing endogenous androgens as much as possible, and S1's potency in prostate weight suppression via endogenous androgen suppression was more potent. While S4 could have resulted in the same level of endocrine suppression at higher dosages (and higher anabolic activity as well), in this model where lowering prostate weight with as low of a dosage of a drug as possible is the goal, S1 had a greater efficacy profile. To clarify, in terms of overall anabolic efficacy, S4 is a better alternative to S1 in terms of potency, just not in the therapeutic context of lowering prostate size where a more suppressive SARM would yield better results closer to castration vehicles. S4 was not compared to Hydroxyflutamide or Finasteride in this study as it exhibited a lower efficacy profile than S1 in regards to endogenous androgen suppression and decreasing prostate weight.  In this animal model, S1 was just as effective at lowering prostate weight as Hydroxyflutamide and Finasteride, while being more effective than both at maintaining muscle mass [R]. In the Finasteride treated group, muscle mass slightly increased, which was likely due to the 15% boost in Testosterone Finasteride causes when endogenous DHT production is inhibited via 5-alpha reductase inhibition. Hydroxyflutamide caused a loss of muscle in a dose dependent manner which is to be expected when endogenous androgens are unable to bind to androgen receptors and exert their effects in the body. S1 caused a dose dependent increase in muscle mass, with muscle mass exceeding that of the control group at each dosage. This is important to note because this is an example of the efficacy of SARMs when it comes to preventing prostate issues induced by natural endogenous androgen production, while simultaneously inducing more anabolic activity than those same levels of endogenous androgens are capable of providing. Increases Bone Mineral Density Testosterone's ability to maintain bone mineral density is mediated through the androgen receptor, but is not potentiated via 5-alpha reductase and its conversion of Testosterone to DHT. The inhibition of 5-alpha reductase did not hinder anabolism in bone in rats or humans, meaning that DHT is unnecessary for facilitating bone mineral retention and overall bone strength [R, R]. While Testosterone isn't a selective androgen by any means, it exhibits a far more favorable anabolic:androgenic selectivity than DHT. We can assert that Testosterone's ability to maintain optimal anabolic effects in bone on its own irrespective of DHT exemplifies how using an even more selective anabolic agent to fulfill the same function with a lower level of androgenicity could very well lead to the same outcomes in bone with a greater safety profile. Hence, why SARMs are being looked at as potential treatment options for bone wasting diseases like osteoporosis. S4's ability to maintain and increase bone mineral density was evaluated in several preclinical animal models. Each animal study determined that S4 induces anabolic effects in bone, prevents bone loss, and increases overall bone mineral density [R, R, R]. They also exhibited a greater level of efficacy of bone retention than DHT.  May Enhance Fat Loss In a study conducted on ovariectomized female rats S4 treatment maintained whole body and trabecular bone mineral density, cortical content, and increased bone strength while lowering body fat [R]. Body fat content can be influenced by a variety of things irrespective of S4 administration, and there is data to support that Andarine has no effect on enhancing fat loss [R]. Personally, I believe the positive effect anabolic agents have on body fat is an indirect result of increased muscle mass which then increases metabolism and results in more fat being burned at rest and an increase in total daily energy expenditure. Therefore, S4 (if anything) likely increases basal metabolic rate indirectly via its ability to build supraphysiological amounts of lean muscle mass, but doesn't inherently accelerate lipolysis. S4 Results (Anecdotal/Recreational Use) The most commonly reported Andarine results among recreational users are significant muscle and strength gains, an increase in muscular detail, dryness and vascularity, as well as an overall improvement in body composition. Muscle hardness, and lean dry muscle gain are the major appeals of S4 for recreational users. One thing that is important to note is that all SARMs don’t work the same, despite exerting anabolic activity in the same manner. Each SARM has a different way it affects the body, as they each have their own anabolic transcription effects, as well as individual specific potency and level of tissue selectivity. Consequently, results from a SARM like Andarine will likely differ from that of Ostarine or LGD-4033. Milligram:Milligram Andarine is not as potent of a muscle builder as LGD-4033, but it is still an effective muscle building agent nonetheless while simultaneously being less suppressive than LGD. S4 is commonly referred to as a “cutting SARM” due to the uniquely apparent muscular detail it brings out at low levels of body fat, similar to that of DHT. S4 Versus Other SARMs Although the mechanism by which Andarine exerts anabolic activity at the androgen receptor is the same as other SARMs, it ultimately leads to different effects on body composition than other SARMs. How Andarine differs from most other SARMs (aside from S23) in particular results wise is the cosmetic look it gives that no other compound can seem to replicate. The hard and dry look that Andarine can bring to the muscle is not matched by almost any other SARM. Andarine isn’t as much of a traditional mass builder, and it is most comparable to something like a moderate dose of Winstrol. S4 Versus S23 When comparing S4 to S23, the first thing we can establish is that S23 is far more suppressive than S4. It is more potent of an anabolic agent milligram:milligram, however, even low dosages will suppress endogenous androgens much closer to castration levels than S4 will. While this is favorable for certain therapeutic applications, it makes S23 a poor option for recreational users who are looking to avoid endocrine suppression, or recover after a “cycle” quickly with ease. For those on Testosterone Replacement Therapy however, this can make S23 a potentially more attractive alternative, as it can induce more anabolic activity at lower dosages. This is why S23 is commonly used alongside exogenous Testosterone (test base) in a recreational context. This is also why S23 is in development right now as a potential male contraceptive [R]. While the data is extremely limited for both SARMs, there is much less preclinical data on S23, even anecdotally. Anecdotally, both SARMs seem to create a similar muscular hardness that can be compared to that of Winstrol or Masteron, but being more similar to Winstrol when it comes to muscle growth potential. S4 Versus Ostarine With the large amount of data on Ostarine it is much easier to make a more accurate comparison between these two SARMs. Both SARMs were developed by GTx, but Andarine was abandoned even after a significant amount of extremely promising preclinical data. We can only assume that the reason for this was because Ostarine was determined to have a greater efficacy and safety profile than S4. That doesn't mean that in certain contexts S4 wouldn't be a more ideal candidate (more likely just with recreational users who prefer it or respond better to it), but in general Ostarine appears to be a more ideal SARM candidate for therapeutic applications. In development, it is also very possible that the eye sight side effect was discovered in humans, and resulted in the projects abandonment, similar to the Cardarine cancer data that was seemingly suppressed for a couple years before being publicly presented. S4 Versus Steroids When it comes to anabolic:androgenic activity, S4 outperforms every single known anabolic androgenic steroid. However, this has its limitations, as there seems to be a lower threshold of diminishing returns with S4 (and SARMs in general) than there is with steroids. When it comes to SARMs and steroids, SARMs are extremely selective at certain dosages, but there is a ceiling where increasing the dosage only increases the potential for side effects in the body, with a greatly diminishing level of muscle growth potential. Muscle:prostate (anabolic:androgenic) ratio of tissue selectivity is far less favorable with steroids (particularly with DHT and DHT derived steroids), but there is a higher ceiling of diminishing returns when it comes to anabolic activity potential with many steroids. Essentially, SARMs appear to be more favorable in a tissue selectivity context when it comes to therapeutic application, but in a bodybuilding context, building a significant amount of muscle beyond the genetic potential of an individual (largely determined by their endogenous androgen production) is limited, and megadosing SARMs appears to build minimal muscle beyond this ceiling and just stimulates greater androgenic activity. Whereas with steroids, while the ratio is far less favorable in a tissue selectivity context when it comes to therapeutic applications, in a bodybuilding context, the ceiling for diminished returns in regards to anabolic activity is much higher (with certain steroids). Anabolic:Androgenic Activity Of S4 (top figure) Vs Testosterone (bottom figure) Despite the high levels of androgenic activity of steroids at this level of diminishing returns for anabolic activity, the fact remains that the ceiling for anabolism when it comes to steroids is higher. Therefore, in a therapeutic context, SARMs will likely become regarded as the better alternative for inducing anabolism with minimal androgenic activity, but in a supraphysiological bodybuilding context, SARMs will not be building the physiques of any Mr Olympia competitors anytime soon. At least not until more selective SARMs with higher ceilings of diminishing returns are developed. In layman's terms, building a massive IFBB pro open bodybuilder caliber ripped physique is impossible with the current SARMs in development, but achieving a muscular and slightly supraphysiological physique with only SARMs with a simultaneous reduction of androgenic side effects in the body (what the majority of the population would prefer) is realistic if one were to evaluate efficacy relative to recreational standards. S4 Versus Winstrol Milligram:Milligram Andarine exhibits similar levels of muscle building potential to Winstrol, but with far less endocrine suppression and androgenic activity in the body. Winstrol is very androgenic (it is a DHT derivative), and will suppress natural Testosterone levels by as much as 55% within just 2 weeks of using 10 mg per day [R].  Most bodybuilders use no less than 30 mg of Winstrol per day, and dosages of 50 – 100 mg per day are far more common in a recreational capacity. Consequently, S4 typically results in similar levels of muscle growth, with less androgenic side effects (including natural testosterone suppression). Winstrol has a bit more of a cosmetic drying out effect that is favorable for bodybuilders stepping on stage. While this makes Andarine sound like a better compound, it needs to be noted that at formidable dosages (where both compounds exhibit significant muscle building potential), S4 typically results in significant night vision complications. Both compounds have severe limitations. S4 Versus DHT In all preclinical animal models that compared equal dosages of S4 and DHT, S4 consistently outperformed DHT in all efficacy measures. DHT in general is a very poor anabolic agent, and excels only in stimulating androgenic activity in androgen sensitive tissues like the prostate gland and hair follicles. Dosage Dosages of 25 – 100 mg per day are commonly used in a recreational context for muscle building purposes. There is no established therapeutic dosage of S4. Typically, users report more favorable outcomes splitting their daily dosage up into increments throughout the day to maintain stable blood serum concentration levels to account for Andarine's short 4 hour half-life. Anecdotally, S4 is reported to exhibit diminishing returns at dosages above 100 mg per day, with 100 mg commonly being referred to as “the sweet spot” dosage.  Vision side effects are reported to occur in a significant amount of users at dosages above 50 mg per day. These dosages were determined by recreational users based upon personal experimentation and anecdotal experiences, and are not indicative of correct or incorrect use. Half-Life The half-life of S4 is 4 hours in humans [R]. The data assessing the pharmacokinetics of S4 in humans was never officially published, but it is referenced a few times, thus we can assume that there was a trial conducted on humans at some point. Side Effects Vision Impairment Vision impairment in dark settings is the most notorious S4 side effect. While this was not reported in any of the preclinical data (likely because no human data was ever published and we can only reference preclinical animal models), Andarine exhibits a very unique and strange side effect. At high enough dosages (50 mg per day or higher seems to be the standard dosage where this side effect kicks in for most individuals) Andarine can cause a temporary yellow tint to be noticed in sight, and significant issues adjusting from dark to light settings. This is most notable during the night time. There are no anecdotal reports of this being permanent, and vision seems to return to normal after discontinuation. The theory behind the cause of this side effect is that Andarine binds to the ocular receptors in the eyes. My theory is a bit different, but more or less the same. SARMs bind tightly to androgen receptors as that is what they were designed to do in a selective manner, and there are androgen receptors in cells of the cornea, lens, iris, and ciliary body of the eye (at least in mice) [R]. I propose that S4 likely binds to the androgen receptors in these parts of the eye (as it is designed to) and affects other cells in these tissues directly through its interaction with the androgen receptor specifically, and this is done in a unique way that impairs vision adjustment, rather than competing and binding to ocular receptors that are otherwise responsible for dark to light vision adjustment. I believe this side effect specifically may have led to the abandonment of S4 in preclinical trials. Decreased Good Cholesterol (HDL) HDL wasn't a health marker evaluated in any of the preclinical animal models conducted using S4. However, bioidentical androgens always exhibit a dose dependent suppression of HDL cholesterol, and this is demonstrated in clinical trials conducted using SARMs as well, just to a lesser extent [R, R]. The clinical data shows dose-dependent suppression of HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels with LGD-4033 usage, as well as all other SARMs that have been evaluated at therapeutic dosages for humans. Andarine is no different, and will also suppress HDL in a dose dependent manner. This suppression is far less extreme than with traditional anabolic steroids, but it exists nonetheless. I assert this based on personal blood work and countless anecdotal logs, not based on official trial data, which should be noted. However, if an official trial was to be conducted on S4, I believe that HDL suppression would be noted. A negative effect on HDL levels is consistently noted as a common side effect of all traditional steroids, and other SARMs. With that being said, S4 doesn't exhibit as much HDL suppression as some other SARMs, at least anecdotally. Based on anecdotal blood work, Ostarine seems to have a more detrimental impact on lipids than S4, but that comes at a trade off for other side effects (e.g. night vision impairment). Of all of the mainstream SARMs, S4 is one of the most forgiving on HDL levels. Testosterone Suppression SARMs have consistently demonstrated suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, thus decreasing testosterone in a dose-dependent manner [R]. S4 is one of the least suppressive SARMs that still retains a promising efficacy profile. While S4 isn't as suppressive as some of the more potent SARMs like S23 or LGD-4033, it will still cause endocrine suppression in a dose dependent manner. Luteinizing hormone levels in castrated rats treated with Testosterone Propionate and GTX-014 (another abandoned SARM) were significantly lower than those of castrated untreated rats (the control for the study) at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg per day. S4 (GTx-007) did not cause significant decreases in luteinizing hormone levels until a dosage of 0.5 mg per day or higher was administered [R].  Therefore, S4 exhibited the ability to elicit maximal stimulation of muscle growth at a dosage that does not suppress LH levels [R]. In another preclinical animal model comparing S4 to DHT, S4 did not suppress LH levels or FSH levels at doses that were capable of eliciting maximal stimulation of muscle growth [R].  The way you can interpret these charts is by looking at where the LH levels and FSH levels are in the intact control rats first and using that as your reference point. As you can see, intact rats (untreated and non-castrated rats) have LH levels ≈ 5 ng/ml and FSH levels ≈ 20 ng/ml. Once a rat is castrated, their LH and FSH levels dramatically spike up as a way to signal to the body to produce more endogenous androgens, as their systemic levels plummet as a result of castration. Its the body's feedback loop that occurs when androgen levels are too low in the body, and its trying to signal to start producing Testosterone. Obviously because the rats are castrated, they aren't able to naturally produce Testosterone like intact rats, so LH and FSH levels go sky high and remain there. The only way to drop those levels would be to endogenously produce a sufficient amount of androgens to fulfill physiological functions, or to administer an exogenous compound that can fulfill those same functions and mitigate the need to produce Testosterone in the first place. Exogenous DHT treatment handily drops FSH and LH levels back to baseline as it is so androgenic. S4 on the other hand was able to restore all muscle loss that occurred after castration, thus fulfilling the critical need for endogenous androgens when it comes to muscle and bone retention, while simultaneously maintaining LH and FSH levels higher than intact rats that weren't castrated. The agonist activity of S4 in the pituitary is measured by evaluating the plasma concentrations of LH and FSH. It took a dosage of S4 over three times higher than DHT to restore LH levels to intact levels, but this dosage was still not even high enough to return FSH levels to the intact control level. The preclinical data suggests that S4 is a very selective SARM and only exhibits a mild amount of suppression at what would be considered therapeutic dosages [R]. Increased Estrogen Or Decreased Estrogen S4 does not aromatize into Estrogen, but it can still cause a systemic increase or decrease in Estrogen levels. S4 suppresses natural Testosterone levels, which can result in an unfavorable balance between Testosterone and Estrogen levels in the body. In addition, S4 has a high binding affinity at the androgen receptor, meaning it is possible that it could divert Testosterone to aromatize that wouldn't have otherwise, consequently increasing Estrogen levels. The systemic elevation of Estrogen levels in the body is commonly misinterpreted as the result of prohormone laced SARMs. High Estrogen Symptoms  Acne, oily skin Erectile dysfunction Low libido Lethargy Gynecomastia (man boobs) Irritability Depression Water retention High blood pressure Enlarged prostate Shrunken testicles Sugar cravings  High dosages and/or long-term use of S4 can cause a decrease in systemic Estrogen levels via higher levels of endocrine suppression. Estrogen facilitated physiological functions in the body are mediated through the aromatization of Testosterone into a sufficient amount of Estrogen. If S4 usage suppresses endogenous Testosterone levels too low, it can result in Estrogen levels dropping as a consequence of the sheer lack of aromatization occurring in the body in a suppressed state. When Estrogen levels get too low, an entirely new set of side effects can occur. Low Estrogen Symptoms  Dull weak orgasms Dry skin and lips Dehydration Erectile dysfunction Low libido Irritability Mood swings Loss of appetite Fatigue Lethargy  Androgenic Activity S4 did not exhibit androgenic activity in preclinical rat models equivalent to that of intact rat controls (non-castrated untreated rats with normal endogenous androgen production) even when used in very high dosages. The dosage of S4 that would be required to yield the same amount of androgenic activity in the body that natural endogenous androgens do would be higher than the therapeutic dosage required. While S4 will increase androgen activity in the body in a dose dependent manner, the selectivity of its anabolic activity:androgenic activity is favorable enough that the therapeutic dosage to reach sufficient anabolic activity in muscle and bone would lower systemic androgenic activity. On the other side of the spectrum, if megadoses of S4 were used daily, it would likely eventually exceed baseline androgenic activity in the body, but this is likely irrelevant for the context in which this compound would hypothetically be used as a treatment anyways. In a performance enhancement context, very high dosages may result in some notable androgenic side effects in the body, while more moderate dosages may reduce androgenic side effects in the body. Hair Loss All androgens cause androgenic alopecia in a dose dependent manner, but the extent to which they do this is dependent on their tissue selectivity, binding affinity, and the dosage used. In general, S4 should not cause any male pattern baldness progression, and it may in fact support its reversal to some extent as a result of endogenous androgen suppression (the decrease of natural Testosterone and DHT that Andarine will cause). This does not exclude temporary shedding (acute telogen effluvium) which can be triggered by a hormonal fluctuation. Hormonal shifts can cause roots to be pushed into the resting state prematurely, and the result of that can be a temporary shedding phase. Temporary shedding phases are commonly caused by hormonal fluctuations, stressors, autoimmune responses, nutrient deficiencies, or chemical imbalances. This is not androgenic alopecia, which is caused by follicular miniaturization induced by androgens. Based on the efficacy data comparing S1 to Finasteride, it is likely that S4 (if anything) would reduce the progression of hair loss at therapeutic dosages based on its similar tissue selectivity [R]. Liver Toxicity AST and ALT levels weren't evaluated in any of the S4 preclinical animal models, so we can only extrapolate data from other clinical trials with similar SARMs. In an Ostarine trial conducted on humans (a very similar SARM to Andarine developed by the same company), short-lived increases in ALT to above the upper limit of normal were observed in eight subjects [R]. Considering this, it's possible that S4 could also elevate ALT levels and exhibit some degree of liver toxicity. Potential Hormone Replacement Therapy Applications In Men S4 doesn't aromatize into Estrogen, therefore it would lack the efficacy profile Testosterone has when it comes to complete hormone replacement therapy. Estrogen is a vital hormone not only in women, but in men as well, just in lower amounts. If S4 in a hypothetical hormone replacement therapy context was not used concurrently with exogenous estrogen in hypogonadal men, low estrogen side effects would start to occur. It is not a viable standalone treatment for hormone replacement therapy. While high levels of estrogen can cause a variety of health complications, low estrogen levels can be just as deleterious. PCT (Post Cycle Therapy) While S4 seems to be one of the least suppressive “mainstream” SARMs, it will still suppress natural Testosterone levels in a dose-dependent manner. It may be prudent to complete a PCT phase (post-cycle therapy) after discontinuing Andarine usage. Due to the half-life of S4, PCT should be started the day after the last dosage was taken. An adequate PCT phase will stimulate the restoration of natural Testosterone production and greatly lower the likelihood of low Testosterone side effects from occurring. Forgoing PCT may increase the risk of muscle loss, fat gain, among all of the other standard side effects associated with Testosterone suppression. How much time off should be taken after PCT should not be dictated by an arbitrary bro-science rule like “time on = time off”, rather it should be dictated by individual specific factors and blood work.

    "content": "The Best And Most Delicious Diet/Macro Friendly Shake Ever!     Throughout my progression in bodybuilding I have drank a lot of weird concoctions to try and maximize how much muscle I gain. Aside from liquifying chicken and drinking it (which I strongly considered at one point), I’ve done it all. One major issue I had with the macro friendly shakes though was that they all tasted like complete shit. Typically, the higher the quality the shake was, the worse it tasted unfortunately. Have you ever tried Hydrolyzed Whey? It’s one of the highest quality protein powders on the market, but of course it tastes like ass. I eat mostly for performance, but I still prefer to have something that doesn’t make me gag obviously. My Go To Shake  After a while, I have started to find new ways to make my healthy clean food still taste good, and I have a specific shake that is definitely one of my favourite diet/macro friendly shakes that I have on a regular basis which tastes exactly like chocolate milk! The macros are as follows: 240 calories, 56 grams protein, 0 grams sugar, 0 grams carbs, 0 grams fat. The protein source is 100% bioavailable as well (all the protein is used in the body). There are only 2 ingredients in this concoction: Pasteurized liquid egg whites, and Walden Farms Calorie Free Chocolate Syrup.  All you need to do if you want a delicious on the go shake with the highest quality macro breakdown out there is pour 2 cups (500 ml) liquid egg whites into a cup, and then add some Walden Farms Zero Calorie Chocolate Syrup. Mix it up, and that’s it, you have yourself a diet/macro friendly delicious chocolate milk tasting shake exploding with the high quality protein. Safety Of Drinking Liquid Egg Whites Vs. Raw Eggs  There is a common myth about drinking eggs, and many people think that you will get Salmonella if you drink them in any form in general. While drinking raw whole eggs absolutely isn’t recommended because the bacteria is still in it and that CAN make you sick and give you Salmonella, it is absolutely safe to drink liquid egg whites. The difference between liquid egg whites and raw eggs is that liquid egg whites are pasteurized, meaning they have had the bacteria completely cooked out of them already, making them safe to drink. Pasteurization kills bacteria and neutralizes Avadin. Egg Whites Are My Key To Getting To The 300 Gram+ Protein Mark Daily I used to have major issues getting in 300 grams+ of protein each day (how much I needed when I was more serious about bodybuilding and competing), and had no idea how anybody could regularly consume that much meat and whey each day consistently. A few years ago, a veteran national level bodybuilding competitor told me that almost all of the protein in his diet comes from drinking liquid egg whites. I never even thought of it before, but it seemed like a damn good idea, and since then I have had at least 750ml-1L of egg whites each day and haven’t looked back. They already taste fine on their own (kind of like milk or sugar water), but once you add the Calorie Free Chocolate Syrup, it literally tastes like having a cheat meal every time you have it. The cheapest place to get liquid egg whites is probably Costco. You can get Walden Farms Calorie Free Chocolate Syrup By CLICKING HERE Tip About Drinking Liquid Egg Whites If You Have Never Had Them Before It's not for everyone. Some digestive systems can take it, others can't. If you are shitting immediately after intake, or constantly having liquid shits, then you aren't absorbing them properly. Usually there is an adjustment period though where your body acclimates to having a bunch of liquid protein added to its' diet, and eventually your digestive system will start to handle it properly. If the worst you are experiencing is farts though, welcome to the world of protein farts. Would I ever lower my protein to stop farting…… thought wouldn’t cross my mind.

    "content": "How To Manage Dating, Finances, School and Bodybuilding When You’re Young     This post is catered more to young adults fresh out of high school with the world at their fingertips; eager to experience everything they can all at once. When I was 18…. After graduating high school I had maybe a couple hundred bucks in my bank account, had no substantial dating experience, had just started getting into lifting seriously and had been doing so for about a year, and had just got accepted into a prestigious university program that would inevitably consume a substantial amount of the next 4+ years of my life. What were my priorities? Well I wanted to make money, date hordes of gorgeous women, get a killer physique, and do well in school to set myself up for my future. Easier said than done. On paper, 4 goals doesn’t sound like a lot, but in reality, all of these things take up literally a humongous portion of your life, and completing them all at once is impossible. One Thing I Have Learned After Managing My Priorities Over The Past 4 years It is FAR more beneficial to dedicate almost all of your time to 1 specific big goal than it is to try completing several huge life goals at once. If I truly went all out trying to do all 4 of these things at once over the past 5 years, I undoubtedly would have got unsatisfactory results in most (if not all) 4 of these goals. How My Post-Secondary Experience Went In my first couple semesters, I worked maybe 16 hours per week max at a golf course and even that was pushing it for what my schedule could accommodate. I had four courses each semester and I worked out 5 times per week. Basically, I had my full efforts aimed at maximizing my physique, and I was putting a half assed effort into school, as well as finance as I worked a shitty minimum wage part time gig, and my dating life had nothing going on. I Made A Pivotal Decision In My Life I still remember when a friend of mine showed me a video in 2012 on YouTube of a guy named Chris from goodlookingloser.com doing cold approaches. I was dumbfounded that a guy could just walk up to any girl he wanted and hit on them (I have no idea why now looking back) without knowing them first or having been introduced to by a friend. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fGxuWv41G4 I decided then and there to get my dating/sex life in check as I was entirely dissatisfied with it, and I don’t know why that video was such a kick in the ass for me, but I joined the goodlookingloser.com forums and the ball started rolling for me….. A LOT. Basically, I had my full efforts aimed at maximizing my physique, and I was putting a half assed effort into school, as well as finance as I worked a shitty minimum wage part time gig, and my dating life had nothing going on. After that point, I focused almost the entirety of my efforts on my physique and exploding my sex life. I no longer had time to even work my 2-3 shifts per week, and I had dropped down to 1-2 short 4 hour shifts per week at my new lifeguarding job, and I was putting even less time into school than I was previously. I was much more content with skating by with a B- average though and doing what I want in life than I would have been getting straight A’s and having no time to do anything else in my life that was of WAY more importance to me at that time. In the next couple years My life was essentially hitting on women, dating, sex and working out, while taking a lighter course load at school on purpose and working a minimal amount of hours as a lifeguard, and eventually as a bouncer as well. I easily hit on at least 10-20 girls per week and almost never had less than 2-3 dates with new women every week or two once I got in a groove (not counting fuck buddies I continued to see and would also dedicate a night too once per week). Now, this may sound like a colossal waste of time and effort to some, but the fact of the matter is, to ACTUALLY be a guy who sleeps with a multitude of new hot women on a very regular basis, you MUST hit on lots of women, and this takes up a substantial amount of time. Not to mention the time investment of actually going on dates with these women and hanging out with them. The Truth About Players Who Get Laid A LOT  Guys who boast lay counts of 100+ and aren’t lying (which 90% of them are) have invested such a large portion of their time into their sex lives; it becomes impossible to flourish in the other major aspects of your life, like finances. Spending hours upon hours each day, each week going out everyday hitting on new woman, messaging girls on Tinder, Plenty Of Fish, etc. getting new girls on the phone and setting up dates, going on dates, this is all extremely time consuming stuff. I truly believe that when guys look up to true “Players” as some sort of God Like men with superpowers, they aren’t realizing just how much of their lives are actually dedicated to being a successful player. There is a huge common misconception that these God’s gift to the planet kind of players that many people look up to simply have women fall into their lap, but the reality is, they PUT IN FUCKING WORK to get that good and get that many women in bed. Most days I actually had a difficult time getting to my classes because I would have a date coming up or I’d be out hitting on new women. How This Applies To Finances And Making Money The same thing applies for a guy that is busting his ass to make tons of money. If a guy is grinding hard day in and day out, working 40-60 hours per week just cranking out brutal intense hours to get rich, do you really think this guy who seemingly “has it made” has much time leftover to go sleep with a bunch of women or really have a social life for that matter? Definitely not. Hopefully he is content with that though and already has his sex life handled or else he will definitely have some major regrets and “what ifs” in his head. The Number One Thing I Recommend To Any Young Guy The number one thing I recommend to any young guy who isn’t yet content with their sex life, finances, education, etc. is to focus on ONE and just one for a set period of time. If you dedicated one year to strictly going all out trying to blow up your sex life, I GUARANTEE it would be 10x more productive than trying to get rich, get straight A’s, and tag a bunch of new girls all in a 3 year span. That 1 year of dedicated focus can do absolute wonders for you. The main issue is, many people try to do everything at once each year, and then before they know it they are in their 30’s and feeling like they severely underachieved in all facets of their life. How To Manage Your 20's After high school, figure out what you care most about, and dedicate the next 2-3 years SOLELY to that one goal. For me, I wanted to get my sex life handled and improve my physique.  These go hand in hand as my bodybuilding helped improve my appearance, which improved my results in my dating life. I put finances on the back-burner to such a degree that I was literally living pay cheque to pay cheque, but damn am I ever glad I did that for those years. There is a lingering sense of failure and “what could have been” thoughts eating away at you if you don’t fully exhaust your goals and fully achieve them. For me, I definitely felt like if I settled down with one girl and focused on other things, I knew I would have regretted it and have felt like I was missing out not still being in the dating game. After almost 3 years of partying, dating, wild sex, and crushing my approach anxiety, I had finally reached a state where I felt satisfied with what I had done, and no longer felt like I would be missing out on life if I moved onto a new goal in my life. My focus entirely shifted towards money after this point, and although I no longer have time to date like I used to, I am totally content and ok with that. After dating that much and that many women, you have such a depth of experience, a sense of entitlement, and have built up the confidence you absolutely will never be needy to women again as you will KNOW FOR A FACT that if at any time your sex life took a negative turn, you could shift your focus back and spend a week or two dedicated fully to getting your dating life back in check and easily meet a few new gorgeous women who will be more than grateful to have you in their dating/sex life. DO NOT Leave Unfinished Business I have achieved what I wanted to, and I don’t have any unfinished business left plaguing my mind in regards to my dating/sex life. Also, now that I’m not going on dates every day or two, I have a substantial amount of free time I can dedicate solely to my new goal. Ask yourself truly, what do you truly want more than anything in your life right at this moment. Once you have defined that, GET AFTER IT!  Obviously if something is impairing your number one goal to a huge degree, then that should become your prioritized goal to get done ASAP so you can move onto crushing your real goals. A good example of this is if you live in a town in the middle of nowhere with a small population, but you care about getting your sex life in check, you may want to consider making finances your number one priority for a defined period of time so you can enable yourself to move to a bigger city, allowing you to pursue your REAL number one goal. Don’t let your youth slip away by wasting your time fucking around or half assing a bunch of different goals. Pick a goal, and bust your ass literally killing that one goal and completely and entirely exhausting it until it is bone dry and you have no further desire to pursue it.

Finasteride/DutasterideWhat Else Should I Be Using To Prevent Hair LossWhere To Get RU58841Related What Is RU58841? RU58841 is a non-steroidal experimental anti-androgen, which is intended for use as a topical treatment for acne and androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness). While it certainly isn't a hair loss cure, RU58841 is the most promising anti-androgen available for preventing hair loss. I have over 3 years of experience with this stuff. What Causes Hair Loss in The First Place and How Will RU58841 Help Prevent It? DHT is the main cause of hair loss in men. DHT (a necessary and otherwise useful hormone) binds to androgen receptors and miniaturizes hair follicles in those prone to MPB (male pattern baldness). This is why it is far more common for men to go bald than women. Testosterone converts to DHT in the body, and since men have much higher levels of testosterone in their bodies than women, men who are prone to MPB consequently (and inevitably) are more likely to suffer from extreme hair loss.  Almost every single case of hair loss is caused by DHT; there is less than a 1/100 chance your hair loss is caused by another factor (unless you are expediting it with anabolic steroids). So, the only way to combat hair loss, is to directly combat DHT (or androgens if you use gear). RU58841 helps prevent this significantly when topically applied to the scalp. It works by competing with DHT and Testosterone for androgen receptor binding. When protected by RU58841, scalp hairs can grow to maturity and not be miniaturized by DHT. A study in the Journal of Steroid Bio-Chemistry and Molecular Biology concluded the exceptionally high topical activity of RU-58841, combined with unprecedented tissue selectivity with respect to systemic effects, suggest that this compound is a candidate of choice for the local treatment of androgenetic alopecia. How I Use It, Store It, And Know If It’s Working A standard dose of 50 mg once per day applied all over the scalp in areas prone to male pattern baldness should suffice, but some individuals may require more (this is dependent on a variety of individual-specific factors). After applying 50 mg over the necessary areas, I rub it in with my fingertips to make sure the liquid is covering the areas entirely, and then let it dry (it takes less than a minute to dry). Afterwards, you can apply your Minoxidil if you use that too. I apply RU58841 after I've washed my hair, and my hair is completely dry. Ideally, I try to apply it within 30 minutes after showering because the scalp produces sebum which can act as a barrier to RU58841 penetrating the skin and blocking DHT topically. I don't usually follow this religiously though as I find it much more convenient to apply it before bed each night. I haven't noticed much (if any) of a difference, but the method mentioned above is the optimal way to apply it. RU58841 is a bit watery, so it is best to apply within and behind the hairline. Regarding storage, mixed RU58841 solutions should be stored in a fridge, and RU58841 raw powder should be stored in a freezer in order to last for as long as possible. Exposing RU58841 to light or higher temperatures will cause degradation of the compound. Personally, I store my RU mixed solutions in my fridge in 50ml bottles, and my RU raw powder in my freezer, in a tightly sealed Ziploc bag placed inside a small container. While many people have no idea how much hair they are losing until it becomes obvious that their hair is receding or looks thinner, I suggest that you start keeping an eye on your hair catcher in the shower drain (if you don’t have one it might be wise to get one to gauge your hair loss intensity). When you shower, if you are very prone to hair loss it may be typical for you to lose 50-100+ hairs in the shower each time you wash your hair. A great way to assess if RU58841 is working for you is by keeping an eye on the hair catcher and doing a rough count of the hairs lost at the end of each shower. Obviously I don’t mean literally pick out each individual hair and count them, but it will be pretty obvious if after you start using a hair loss prevention compound there are less hairs in the hair catcher than there usually are. Within a couple weeks of using RU58841, I went from losing 50+ hairs every shower, to losing 1-5 hairs max. It was pretty amazing to say the least, and within a month or so I started noticing density coming back to my previously diffuse thinning scalp. Current Hair Status How Do Topical Anti-Androgens Compare To Finasteride And Dutasteride? Both Finasteride and Dutasteride work by inhibiting the production of DHT, indirectly preventing hair loss because there is simply no DHT left to negatively affect your scalp. RU58841 on the other hand competes for androgen receptors, leaving DHT levels intact, and just partially prevents it (depending on the dose) from binding to receptors and causing the miniaturization that ensues in those prone to hair loss. On paper, and in practical application in numerous individuals, topical anti-androgens that locally bind to androgen receptors and leave systemic androgen levels intact may be a superior alternative to Finasteride and Dutasteride. Why Topical Anti-Androgens Are More Promising For Steroid Users In Particular It is important to note that Finasteride (which is typically the first resort for guys looking for hair loss prevention) is very effective for treating hair loss related to steroid usage, BUT will only protect you from Testosterone converting to DHT. Although it is a common belief that DHT derived steroids may have their androgenic effect inhibited as well, this belief is incorrect, as they do not convert into more androgenic compounds via 5-AR. Finasteride is a type 2 5-AR inhibitor, not an anti-androgen. Since 5-AR is what is necessary to convert Testosterone to DHT, Finasteride (a 5-AR inhibitor) will absolutely not be effective against DHT created by Dianabol, trenbolone, anadrol, winstrol, masteron, equipoise, etc. Consequently, your options for steroids you can run will be severely limited as you will essentially only have hair loss protection against mild doses of testosterone. Testosterone at high enough doses will still cause androgenic alopecia in individuals prone to hair loss, even if on Finasteride. RU58841 competes with all steroids for androgen receptor binding, it has no bearing on the activity of 5-AR. RU58841 Effect On Your Results/Gains Vs. Finasteride/Dutasteride Based on the literature available, neither RU58841 or 5-AR inhibitors have shown any negative impact on muscle growth or strength metrics. What Else Should I Be Using To Prevent Hair Loss Even if you're using a topical anti-androgen, there are some other compounds that are worth considering stacking alongside it.  Ketoconazole shampoo: A high quality Ketoconazole shampoo should be applied by rubbing it into your scalp, and leaving it for 5-10 minutes before washing it out, each time you wash your hair. Ketoconazole is a powerful antifungal, and also behaves as a mild anti-androgen. It works well and I use it alongside my RU58841. A high quality Ketoconazole shampoo differs from Nizoral in that it contains a variety of other useful ingredients that Nizoral does not contain, and as a result, it won't dry your hair out like Nizoral potentially could. However, Nizoral is quite a bit cheaper, so it's not a bad idea to alternate between a high quality Ketoconazole shampoo and Nizoral to save money. If Nizoral doesn't cause your hair to dry out, I would stick with that as it is cheaper and has the same amount of Ketoconazole in it anyways (the ingredient you want). Minoxidil: Minoxidil will actually revitalize hair follicles and regrow hair that has been lost. It is amazing stuff. There is a clear difference between brands though, so I would recommend getting a high quality Minoxidil that is formulated to leave your hair presentable and not oily/greasy like most generic brands (e.g. Kirkland). Finasteride: Finasteride is worth evaluating as well, as it can be used as an adjunct to a topical anti-androgen to strengthen your protocol, but the use of either should be carefully considered against a variety of individual specific criteria.   Where To Get RU58841 Pre-mixed RU58841 solutions (or the Raw RU58841 Powder if you want to make your own solutions) can be ordered here: Anageninc The only other company I also trust with equal quality is the following: Chemyo I haven't noticed a difference in quality between the two. For the carrier (what the RU58841 raw powder is mixed in), I prefer PG (propylene glycol) + Ethanol. I would find it rare for someone's scalp to be irritated by the PG/Ethanol to the point of needing to use KB as the carrier instead. Both carriers work fine, some people just seem to have skin irritation to particular carriers as opposed to others. You won’t grow a thick mullet on a severely balding head overnight using any hair loss prevention compounds so keep your goals realistic and be patient. The key is hair loss prevention; any re-growth is a fringe benefit.

Melanotan II (Melanotan II) is an injectable peptide used mainly to vastly increase your body’s ability to tan. The pigment of your skin getting darker is the result of UV ray exposure. As your skin becomes exposed to UV rays, melanin is produced to protect your skin from burning and sun damage. A tan is almost like a shield of sorts. The darker you are, the stronger your shield is. Hence why super pale people are the most prone to skin cancer and burning. Why Was Melanotan II Created/What’s Its Main Purpose? Melanotan II was originally designed with the purpose of preventing the chance of skin cancer, and it certainly can. After taking Melanotan II, your body will be stimulated to produce an exponentially higher level of melanin. As melanin is the main determinant of skin color, the more melanin you produce, the darker your skin can potentially become. I’m not even joking when I say that a ghostly pale red haired person who would normally never dream of achieving any color darker than bright red can get DARK with Melanotan II. Melanotan II has been thoroughly analyzed via clinical trials, and they showed that Melanotan II was safely able to promote melanogenesis (the process of melanocytes in your body producing more melanin). As you may have guessed, fair skinned people have low base levels of melanogenesis. As Melanotan II will greatly promote melanogenesis in all users, greater levels of melanin can be produced which protect the hypodermis (the layer under the skin) from potentially damaging UV rays. As a result of this process, Melanotan II can effectively protect your skin from exposure damage. It’s An Erectile Dysfunction Cure Too!?      As if this drug wasn’t cool enough, it can give you hard-ons like you just hit puberty again. Melanotan II has also been shown to have major aphrodisiac effects. Melanotan II showed a dose-dependent effect on erections in anesthetized rats during clinical trials. Not only will it increase your erectile quality, duration, and the amount of erections you get each day, it can drastically reduce your refractory time, as well as increase your sexual desire itself. It’s arguable that you wouldn’t even need Viagra or Cialis anymore if you were on Melanotan II, it’s that potent. Melanotan II Is An Excellent Fat Burner Clinical trials have also shown potent fat burning effects from Melanotan II usage. While many think that Melanotan II can only help you lose fat indirectly through its appetite suppression side effect, it has been disproven in a series of tests conducted on mice where they were fed the exact same diet and the amount of visceral and subcutaneous fat tissue was reduced only in the group of mice being administered Melanotan II. It also decreases the accumulation of fat during a weight gain phase (bulk) via accelerated lipid mobilization. As I just mentioned, Melanotan II has appetite suppressing effects, which indirectly help fat loss A LOT. When you are in a calorie restricted state trying to lose weight, it is extremely easy to fall victim to your intense cravings and cheat on your diet and ruin your progress. Melanotan II makes sticking to your diet infinitely easier, as your cravings will literally disappear. Effect On Insulin Sensitivity One notable finding from the clinical trials that largely goes unmentioned is the ability Melanotan II has to increase insulin sensitivity. Results showed that Melanotan II administration increased insulin-mediated glucose disposal, but didn’t affect the capacity of insulin to suppress EGP. In a separate study done on obese rats, the insulin sensitivity of the Melanotan II group was significantly better. Why should you care about insulin sensitivity you ask? Well, basically the more insulin sensitive you are, the more favorable your body composition can become. When packing on weight for example, if you are extremely insulin sensitive, you will be far more likely to put on favorable lean weight than garbage fat fluff. If you’ve been slamming high glycemic carbs for weeks on end, and are getting fat as shit, it’s likely your insulin sensitivity is down the toilet, and basically to continue to make physique progression and gain muscle you will be required to reduce your carb intake, get leaner, and resensitize yourself to insulin. The higher your insulin sensitivity the better in the world of bodybuilding, so that’s just another awesome benefit Melanotan II has. I delve into insulin sensitivity and staying lean with more detail in my articles elaborating on how to bulk without getting fat. Melanotan II Side Effects While there aren’t many side effects, there are a few very common ones. Nausea is one of them, as well as flushing of the face, tiredness, decreased appetite and spontaneous erections (in males only obviously). The flushing of the face is very temporary and usually occurs within 10 minutes of administering Melanotan II. It usually lasts no longer than an hour in my experience. It goes away pretty quickly once your body gets adjusted to the peptide. Nausea can also be countered by taking an antihistamine an hour before taking Melanotan II. Ginger root is a natural antihistamine and works well for preventing nausea induced from Melanotan II. Usually the nausea is only caused by taking too large of a dose than your body is ready for though anyways, and all negative side effects should disappear over a short span of time. Less common side effects during longer trials include: darkening of lips, increase in the number of freckles, darkening of freckles, and increased libido in females. To minimize any negative effects, simply opt for a lower dose. Usually the users who encounter issues or undesirable side effects are simply dosing way too high. My Experience With Melanotan II Okay, let’s preface this by making it abundantly clear that I am extremely fair skinned, and DO NOT have the ability to tan naturally.  I have never in my life gone even relatively tan colored from sun exposure, and all that happens is my skin goes red if I lay out in the sun too long. I started researching Melanotan II “on my rat subjects” and literally within a week I could already see a darker skin tone than I had ever seen before in my life (aside from competition spray tans).  Within 3 weeks of moderate sun exposure and Melanotan II administration, “my rats” looked 100x darker than they could have ever become naturally. Results increased in a dose dependent manner during my experiments. However side effects were seen in my testers at higher dosages too. As a result, I feel the optimal dosing range for future clinical trials would be 250-500mcg daily. The Best Tanning Lotion To Use With Melanotan II I got this recommendation from Chris on GoodLookingLoser.com and it is fantastic.  I have used some tanning creams and lotions in the past with bronzers in them, and they all would come off on my clothes or stain whenever I sweat. It gets annoying as shit to only be able to wear black so you don’t stain your clothes every time you leave your house to say the least, and this tanning lotion definitely doesn’t disappoint. I have used it throughout my entire research period, and it DEFINITELY has helped reach an extra level of darkness (you literally look a bit darker right after one use of this stuff) and it doesn’t come off and ruin your clothes.  Win win. I just ordered 3 more bottles of it myself. You can order it using the link below: Millenium Tanning New Solid Black Bronzer Tanning Bed Lotion, 100x, 13.5-Ounce The Best Melanotan II Protocol Unfortunately, there is a common “loading phase protocol” floating around the internet created by bodybuilders over a decade ago that is still being used to this day as the staple for recommended dosing. I am telling you right now, the loading phase is complete bullshit and is totally unnecessary and will just make you have a much higher chance of side effects, including blowing up with freckles (if you are prone). I will outline the best “hypothetical” Melanotan II protocol below that will still get you dark, but save you money and reduce your chance of freckles or new moles popping up. I learned about it from a very intelligent researcher online, and is what I follow myself anytime I use Melanotan II. Assess response to a very low dose first (50-75 mcg), and taper up from there. If you start gung-ho at 500 mcg shots when your body has never taken Melanotan II before, you are much more likely to experience negative side effects like nausea and notice an increase in freckles if you are prone. It took me weeks before I had even reached a dose of 250 mcg pre-tanning. This is because I took a very conservative approach, tapered extremely slowly, and tapered my UV exposure very slowly as well. I eventually made my way all the way up to 500 mcg pre-tanning (this took a couple months). The end result was a very dark tan, with no noticeable new freckles, moles, or apparent darkening of current freckles and moles. Now, I can maintain a very dark and healthy looking tan with only one 250 mcg shot per week and a little bit of UV exposure. An ideal approach in my opinion would be to start very low, and then every 3 sessions (Melanotan II administration coupled with post-administration tanning) bump the dosage by 25 mcg and increase the tanning duration by 1 minute (assuming tanning is being done in a tanning bed). Administration and tanning would be done every other day or every third day (or less frequently depending on personal needs). Administration should NEVER be done on days that you are not going tanning. Tanning should always follow Melanotan II administration within an hour of the shot. * DO NOT DO A LOADING PERIOD FOR MELANOTAN. IT IS UNNECESSARY, ONLY USE ON DAYS OF TANNING. * Protocol will vary depending on skin type and response to melanotan. For those susceptible to freckling, moles, or at risk to burning or skin cancer; start with a low dose of Melanotan and short tanning sessions (as low as a minute or 2 if you must), as melanin density increases, tanning for longer periods will become safer with a lesser risk of freckling or burning. Benefits of pre-tan Melanotan II administration: – Increased melanin production over tanning or melanotan alone. – Immediate oxidation of newly created eumelanin, creating that glowing “suntan”. – Minimal tanning. – Minimal Melanotan use. – Reduced experiences of freckling, discoloring, uneven pigmentation, nausea, etc… – More control of “degree” of tan.  Why This Protocol Is Best: Melanotan II only increases melanin production, but the skin tans by two mechanisms. The second mechanism is the oxidation of the melanin that occurs from exposure to UVA rays, this is the tan more associated with that golden beach look. The increase in melanin from melanogenesis is more associated with skin tone and coloring in general. If you expose yourself to sun after a loading phase (typical protocol found online), all that built up melanin will oxidize in the exposed areas leading to a dramatic tanning effect and thus uneven tanning. I want to stress the importance of some exposure to UV while administering Melanotan. If you just administer at night the body increases melanin production in areas with greater natural melanocyte activity, genitals, freckles, moles, etc… leading to many of the sides reported with MT, but if used in conjunction with UV, the body has mechanisms to increase melanin production and melanocyte activity in areas that need the production to protect from UV photodamage, such as the skin. How To Reconstitute (Mix) And Store Melanotan II Melanotan II comes in a lyophilized puck of powder in a vial. Anyone trying to sell you something else (like nasal sprays) and passing it off as Melanotan II is ripping you off. Typically Melanotan II vials have 10mg (10,000mcg) in them. To reconstitute (mix) them, you will need Bacteriostatic Water. Bacteriostatic Water is just sterile water that has 0.9% benzyl alcohol in it. It is used to dilute or dissolve medications that can only be administered via injection. The container can be reentered multiple times (usually by a sterile needle) and the benzyl alcohol suppresses or stops the growth of most potentially contaminating bacteria. I like to mix each vial with 2ml of Bacteriostatic Water. The proper way to mix it without damaging the lyophilized Melanotan II is to push the Bacteroistatic water into the vial slowly, and let it drip down the side of the vial. Squirting it full blast right into the powder may damage the peptide and completely ruin the Melanotan II. After the water has all gone into the vial, gently swirl it around until the solution is completely clear. It is now ready, and should be stored in the fridge when not being used. To Summarize Melanotan II is an amazing peptide with a variety of extremely helpful uses. I am very happy with the results I had from it, and despite my initial paranoia (extreme terror) prior to using it I am pleased to say I didn't have one of those Melanotan II horror stories you hear about where the person blew up with moles, and I attribute that to my slow and steady approach and thorough research I did prior. For those of you wondering what that mask is doing on my face in the featured image no I'm not pretending to be Bane, I have obstructive sleep apnea so I put that mask on before I go to bed and attach it to a CPAP machine so I can breathe properly.

    "content": "The Secret To Building Huge Legs     The Secret To Building Huge Legs This article is going to cover in brief detail the steps you should take to maximize your leg training sessions to ensure maximum hypertrophy. A lot of people struggle with bringing up their legs, and I too have struggled with this in my eternal quest for the “Greek God” physique. There was definitely a lot of learning about my body, as well as about training before I was able to find a method that worked as great as the one I currently use now which has substantially helped increase the muscular development of my legs, and now I finally have a set of wheels I am proud of. Over the years, I’ve tried tons of different training styles, and I find I respond the best to this type of leg training specifically. I’m not going to say this will work best for everyone, but in general I think it is a style of training that will result in a great level of hypertrophy for most (if not everyone) in contrast to opposing theories/methods. You Don’t Build Big Legs With Big Weights There is a common myth that “a bigger muscle is a stronger muscle.” While in some cases this may apply, it certainly isn’t always applicable, otherwise every professional bodybuilder would be able to blow strongmen out of the water in strength in every exercise, but you know as well as I do, this is never the case. It is rare to see a pro bodybuilder ever put more than 3 or 4 plates max during squats or deadlifts, meanwhile you have strongmen without even close to the same muscular development throwing down 800 pound + lifts. If you are interested in maximizing the size of your legs specifically, you will want to train them with MODERATE weight, with LOTS of volume and high reps. Driving blood into the muscle with higher reps (I usually do anywhere between 15-30 reps per set for leg exercises) will stretch the fascia, promoting muscular hypertrophy and maximizing your development. Granted, you obviously need to be doing an adequate amount of work in the gym and hitting the legs from all angles to achieve this maximum growth, but as a general rule of thumb, low rep ranges with crazy high weights will benefit you far less size wise than the method I mentioned. All doing low rep squats with stupid amounts of weight did for me was give me tendinitis in my knees and get a few stares from impressed gym bros who would oggle how many plates I had loaded up on the bar. Keep in mind when you are at the gym, and you see a gorgeous fit girl with a perfect ass and unreal quad sweep and leg development, do you think she’s throwing 4-5 plates on the squat rack to get her legs looking that amazing? No chance! She got them by doing super light weight (relative to what gym rats consider heavy).  Leave Your Ego At The Door In my first few years of lifting I used to feel like I had to prove something every time I went to the gym. I was always trying to get stronger each week, and I would get validation from lifting heavy from my friends that made me feel good and made me do some really dumb shit. By dumb shit I mean lifting WAY heavier than was necessary to grow adequately. When I was 20 years old I would consistently deadlift as high as 550 pounds every single back day, and squat as high as 500 pounds on every single leg day. My rep ranges would be as low as 4 reps, and sometimes even maxing out with 1 rep, and I risked injury every single time I did those lifts. I got lucky and the only notable injury I ever had as a result of training like a moron for a couple years straight is persistent knee tendonitis (which I still have to this day). I changed my training style once I was finally able to accept that I am at the gym to make my body as aesthetic as possible to WOMEN, not to impress the local bodybuilders and my friends with feats of strength. After finally being able to leave my ego at the door, which is harder than it seems for some people to do, I stopped getting training related injuries completely, and my muscular development actually improved at a quicker rate. Here’s a picture of my legs on the left when I would squat 400-500 pounds each leg day, and then to the right of that here’s a picture of my legs now. Guess how much I squat now? 225 pounds.  Yup, only 2 pizzas on the squat rack, I must be a pussy. At least that’s what I would’ve said a few years ago. Not only will lifting with moderate weight encourage hypertrophy, it will drastically reduce your chance of injury, which in itself is obviously a huge obstacle to physique development. Not to mention, if you lift heavy your whole life, you will likely encounter longevity issues and eventually not even be able to train properly because of all of the nagging injuries you may have to deal with down the line in a couple decades from irresponsible lifting in your youth. Lift Weights Only Heavy Enough So That It Won’t Negatively Impact Your Form This is self-explanatory. If your form is compromised by the weight in any capacity, you aren’t breaking down the muscle adequately while minimizing the chance of injury. Only lift heavy enough that you can still complete your set with good form. If you want to go work through failure on an exercise, get a spotter to help assist you, DO NOT alter your form to allow yourself to get a few shitty cheat reps out that could very well injure you and take you out of commission. The reason bodybuilders seem to lift so light in real life isn’t because they’re so hopped up on drugs they can be lazy, it’s because they contract and squeeze the hell out of the muscle each rep to ensure they still get maximum hypertrophy, while eliminating the chance of getting a career ending injury. If a pro bodybuilder tears his chest doing a 5 plate bench press max-out, there goes his income out the window. Simply not worth it. Usually the only time a pro bodybuilder will lift heavy is for the cameras if he needs to make a training video or a fan video for furthering his career. Train Legs Twice Per Week While this isn’t necessarily something I encourage for everyone per say, because some people simply train hard as fuck and some guys simply don’t. If you don’t go balls to the wall during your weekly leg day, hitting your quads, hamstrings and calves from all angles and completely wreck yourself to the point where you can barely walk back to your car after your workout, you would probably benefit from two leg days per week if they are a weak point for you. I would recommend either doing the first leg day as a heavier leg day (obviously still keep the weight reasonable as mentioned above), and the second leg day would be more of a light weight cardiovascular style leg day (even higher rep with a focus on driving a ridiculous amount of blood into the muscle) doing exercises you neglected to do on your first leg day. If you opt for two legs days per week, make sure you at least have a few days between them, and don’t train a big supporting body part the day before either of them like back. This will only hinder the recovery of your legs and impede their growth if you don’t spread out the workouts adequately. Another method that I recommend is having one day a week dedicated to quads, and another day in the week dedicated to hamstrings and calves. It’s technically doing “legs” twice per week, but you can put more of a focused effort into each individual part of the leg on the separate days, and hit them harder by themselves. I personally find that after I do squats or leg press my hamstrings tend to get pretty tired so I am not able to train them with as much intensity as I would be able to if I did a separate day later in the week dedicated to them. Once I started splitting them up I noticed much more growth in my hamstrings, which was definitely a weak point for me. If you are training legs hard twice per week, make sure you take a rest day at some point each week. Legs are a huge body part, and demand a very intense level of focus, energy, and effort to sufficiently complete each work out. Consequently, training them balls to the wall takes a toll on your Central Nervous System, and I definitely encourage you to take a full rest day each week. Wear A Weight Belt There are some people that actually believe you’re a pussy if you use a weight belt because you’re not lifting the weight “raw.” I could care less about if I’m lifting the weight “raw” or not, and frankly I find it kind of ridiculous that someone would put themselves at risk of injury simply so they can feel like they are more masculine than someone who uses a belt. I even use the “pussy pad” or “tampon” when I squat.  I’m not going to make a myriad of points as to why you should use a belt too or why it’s stupid to not use one, but I’ll tell you this. With a heavy weight on your back, a belt will drastically reduce your chance of an orthopedic injury by reducing stress on the spine and creating better body biomechanics (no brainer already in my opinion), and it will also improve your lifting performance. I remember reading research conducted by Weider Research Group to actually determine if it increases performance or not and they found that on average, every person who participated could squat 10 pounds heavier while wearing a weight belt than they could without it. The study was done on 12 trainers who had at least 5 years experience of squatting. Research has also shown that wearing a lifting belt during squats increases the level of muscle activation in the quads and hamstrings, consequently promoting better muscle growth. There are a million belts out there, this is the one I use and it works well for me and has lasted several years.  Its’ price is decent in comparison to most other high quality belts and it is higher quality than most belts too. I probably am not in a wheelchair thanks to this thing (you will see what I mean when I upload a few of my old 500-600 pound Deadlift videos to future article publications). If you want to check it out or order it for yourself I linked it HERE for you. Tweak Your Diet On Leg Day Accordingly Depending on how your diet is, you can likely allocate your macros differently on leg days to increase your recovery and performance. By this I mean, allocating days of higher energy or carbohydrate usage to your leg days on purpose, in order to maximize your opportunity to build your legs up each week. For example, if you do a carb-cycling diet, this would mean allocating your “high carb” days strategically on your leg days. Or if you do a different style of dieting perhaps you have a cheat day/meal you allow yourself each week, you could allocate this to your leg day. These little diet tweaks will provide extra benefit for your leg day recovery. You certainly don’t want to be having your lowest calorie or lowest carb day on the day you are hitting your biggest body part which demands the most nutrients for recovery, that would just be illogical (in my opinion). To give a real-world example of this, when I was trying to build my legs up I would always ensure my high carb day occurred on leg day. I would also increase my intra-workout carb intake accordingly to expedite my recovery, and encourage maximum growth. On a day like shoulders or arms I might only have 2 scoops of Intra-MD intra-workout (contains 60 grams highly branched chain cyclic dextrins), but on an intense leg day I would double my intake and drink 4 scoops Intra-MD intra-workout (120 grams HBCD’s) to minimize post-workout soreness, and get my legs recovered as quick as possible so I can hit them a second time that week without being inadequately/only partially recovered.  This product is by no means mandatory; I’m simply explaining how I would go about favoring my weekly macro allotment towards my leg workouts to encourage their continuous progress. You could do the same process with whatever your diet is comprised of already and simply tinker with your macro percentages to favor your leg workouts each week. To Summarize Increase your training frequency (do more leg workouts), leave your ego at the door and train smart with moderate weight, higher reps and perfect form to encourage stretching of muscular fascia for hypertrophy and avoiding injury, adjust your diet accordingly to favor your recovery after your leg day training sessions, and train hard as hell.

    "content": "The Most Important Factor Affecting How Attractive You Are To Women     The Number 1 Factor Affecting How Attractive You Are  While there are obviously countless factors that will ultimately affect how attractive you are to women, I’m going to cover the one I strongly believe is the most important, and best of all, the most controllable one. This factor is…. HAVING A LEAN FACE VS. A FAT FACE Although every single person has their own individual specific genetic predisposition to where they hold body fat, it is a given that when you gain fat, it is gained EVERYWHERE. Not just in your love handles or your ass. Whether you like it or not, when the scale goes up, if that weight isn’t comprised ENTIRELY of lean muscle tissue, then your face is either gaining fat or water weight, both of which will shroud your underlying facial features, consequently making you LESS attractive to women. There is nothing less attractive than a guy with a double chin, no visible bone structure in their face, and a smile that looks like your face is about to completely envelop itself. A prominent jaw line, cheek bones, Adams apple etc. are just some of the features that the male face has that are often completely unseen because the majority of the male population is simply too fat. The bottom line is, a pudgy face isn’t an attractive face.  To maximize your attractiveness, you need to sharpen your facial features as much as possible, and get rid of all the blubber and fluff that is totally hiding what could very well be the face of a stunner. I’ve seen plenty of guys who truly believe they are ugly do a successful cutting phase and get shredded only to be shocked at how attractive they really are. The difference between a fat face and a lean face is astounding, and it is the number one determinant in how attractive you will be to women (in my opinion). YOU DON’T NEED FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY!!!!!!! Too many guys are quick to jump on the surgery bandwagon, and assume that because of their lackluster prominence of facial features that they need extensive and extremely expensive facial reconstruction surgery to become attractive. This is the most frustrating thing I have heard far too often, because 99% of the time, these guys are literally saving up thousands of dollars to shell out 10 grand on jaw surgery, when they could go to the grocery store and buy proper food and just get rid of the body fat via a proper diet within a couple months and look exponentially better than they would with surgery. As a rule of thumb, if you think you need surgery to have an attractive face, DO NOT get surgery until you have cut down to single digit body fat % levels. You literally have ZERO clue how attractive you actually are until you cut all that useless fluff off your face with a proper diet and exercise regimen. In almost every single case, this is all that is needed.   GET UNDER 10% BODYFAT! Until you have cut down into the single digit body fat % range (sub 10% body fat), you will have a completely biased and deluded view on how attractive you are. Some guys who literally couldn’t pick up a decent looking girl for the life of them can totally transform their sex lives by simply reducing their body fat % level to sub 10% to reveal what their face actually looks like. I am a perfect example of this, as I used to do intense bulking phases, followed by strict cutting phases literally over and over to gain muscle mass. During my bulking phases, my body weight would climb as high as 250+ pounds, while my weight on the scale at 5% body fat is only approximately 195-200 pounds. When I would go out and do cold approaches, my results would be SIGNIFICANTLY worse when I was “huge” but bloated and far too fat with my facial features completely obscured by garbage weight, and my results would instantly start skyrocketing as I would lose body fat and start to cut down. Here are a couple more great examples of how much more attractive you can become simply by just losing body fat: Chris from goodlookingloser.com  Victor from boldanddetermined.com  Water Retention Effect On Facial Features While having low body fat levels certainly is the most important factor determining how lean your face looks, another factor is almost as prominent of a concern. This is water weight. Two very common causes of facial bloating among individuals are a poor diet with excessive carbohydrate and salt intake, as well as being dehydrated. Carbohydrates and salt absorb water like a sponge, and when your intake of these two things is too high, your body will inevitable bloat more from it. Also, if your water intake isn’t sufficient on a daily basis, your body will start retaining water on purpose to off-set the fact that you are dehydrated. In addition, while this is commonly not a concern for the average individual, for enhanced athletes who use copious amounts of aromatizing anabolic steroids or other drugs that lead to water retention and facial bloating, you can still be sub 10% body fat and have shrouded facial features from water retention. For example, within a couple weeks of starting an off-season steroid cycle consisting of moderate doses of testosterone and dianabol (both high level aromatizing drugs), despite still being sub 8-9% body fat, my face will have already entered the realm of “fat” from the illusion created by the 5-10 pounds of water weight my body will be holding onto. Muscle Mass Effect On Facial Features I definitely notice a positive impact that lean muscle mass has on facial features. When I was 17 years old and just got into weight lifting seriously, I was a pretty low body fat %, albeit with extremely low amounts of lean muscle mass as well. As such, I still had a “baby face” and it didn't look very masculine at all. Over the years, as I gained substantial amounts of muscle mass I watched my face actually transform in a very positive way. When you gain lean muscle tissue, it is distributed evenly in your body just like fat would be, so your face will indirectly get more muscular as well from your muscle gaining regimen (if you have one).  I strongly believe that the muscle I have gained on my face, coupled with a low body fat % has been the number one factor impacting my success in my sex life as the years progressed and I started receiving more positive outcomes from my interactions with women. Can You Spot Reduce Body Fat In Your Face? In short, no you can’t. When you lose body fat, you will lose it everywhere. You can’t target fat loss in specific areas of your body. How To Lose Facial Fat In order to lose facial fat, you need to get leaner everywhere via diet manipulation. There are a lot of misconceptions around getting very lean. The key is simply to slowly restrict your body of energy. While doing this with calorie reduction, weight training, and cardio, you can slowly peel weight off your body without slowing your metabolism down too much, and eventually (and ideally) end up in the middle single digits body fat % wise (4-9) without having sacrificed much (if any) lean muscle mass. Your body requires calories to give it energy. Your metabolism burns a certain amount of calories/energy each day based upon your body composition, your hormonal profile, your activity level, your age, among a variety of other factors. In order to lose fat, you simply need to eat less (take in less energy) than your body expends each day. If you are functioning on a calorie deficit/energy deficit, your body is burning more calories than it is taking in, consequently it will turn to stored energy (stored fat) to provide it with the energy it needs to fuel the difference of calories during that day’s activities. Tracking Your Calorie Intake With A Food Scale Food Scale: Having an accurate food scale for measuring out and counting your calorie intake per day will soon become your greatest weapon used to wage war on fat. Knowing exactly what your calorie intake is each meal per day will let you know if you are achieving your calorie intake requirements of each day necessary for fat loss.  Click HERE for an accurate digital scale  To Summarize Reduce your body fat to less than 10% body fat by eating a clean and calorie mindful diet, avoid excessive amounts of carbohydrates and salt to avoid facial bloating, and drink around a ½ gallon-1 gallon of water per day to allow adequate water flushing from your body, which will prevent water retention in your face.

    "content": "How To Reverse Diet – Comprehensive Guide To Prevent Fat Rebound After Cutting     So you just busted your ass training hard as hell for several months, eating a very strict and restricted diet, did your cardio even though you wanted to fucking kill yourself, and you are finally shredded and done your cutting phase and on the brink of wanting to binge eat like a single girl on Valentines day…… The most common question that will arise at this point: WTF Do I Do Now? Well I’ll tell you. Two Words.  REVERSE DIET Losing the weight is a battle in itself yes, but another test of your will power will come AFTER you are done your cut. At this point you may very well be totally taxed mentally, be famished as hell 24/7, and ready to get back into a calorie surplus. Let’s not be so hasty guys, there is one thing you need to know first. When you have been chopping your calories by the week and increasing cardio sessions to several longer and longer sessions per week, your metabolism will gradually slow down. This process is your body’s natural response to preventing itself from starving to death. Basically, if you start a cut phase with a maintenance of say 3000 calories (hypothetically), that is what your body will maintain its’ weight on at that particular point. As you get leaner and leaner and lose more weight by increasing your calorie deficit via eating less and with extra cardio, your body adjusts to this by essentially lowering your maintenance calorie level accordingly to prevent itself from starving. As you eat less, your body’s metabolism will slow down to accommodate your continuous pattern of eating less, and your body’s baseline for maintenance will slowly go down as well. So, by the end of a 12 week cut where you started at 3000 calories per day and needed to get down to 2100 calories per day (hypothetical again) to get shredded, your body’s maintenance calories are DEFINITELY no longer 3000 calories. At this point, you have been eating in a deficit for so long, if you threw 3000 calories back into your body, your body would be shocked by a large calorie surplus because your metabolism has slowed down on purpose as a result of your intentional calorie restriction. So What Does This Mean? This means that if you jump into a bulk phase literally right after a cut phase where you haven’t revved your metabolism back up to normal, you will put on copious amounts of fat very quickly even if you are only eating what was your maintenance level caloric intake 12 weeks ago. This is the Pattern I Typically See With People Who Diet Down And Is Why 99.9% of People Can’t Stay Shredded Even if they do complete a successful cutting phase and get their body fat levels down to a very respectably lean level, they totally saturate their body with calories after they finish their contest prep, or their cut phase, or whatever they are shredding down for. When they do this, they BLOW THE FUCK UP with water weight, glycogen/carbohydrate over-spilling, and fat gains because they didn’t take a calculated approach to getting their metabolism back to normal before jumping back to a level of calories they would normally eat at if they weren’t cutting. Even when I competed at bodybuilding shows, the majority of competitors would literally be 20 pounds heavier than their contest stage weight less than a week after they stepped on stage because of going to shitty eating habits after the show while simultaneously having a slowed down metabolism. At first, the weight might look like it’s muscle for the first couple days because your muscles are getting saturated with glycogen again, but it doesn’t take a lot of carbs to refill your glycogen stores, and within a couple days these people are on the express lane to fat ass city. It is actually very common for competitors to cut down for 14-18 grueling weeks of cutting, look great on stage, and then within 4 weeks be completely out of shape again. They literally just throw all their hard work in the toilet and look like shit again within a matter of weeks. I’ve been guilty of this too in the past before I understood how to properly reverse diet, and I would literally watch my abs disappear more and more by the day. I’d go from a sliced vascular hard grainy physique that I worked my ass off to attain, to a soft doughy bloofy shit brick house physique within 5-6 weeks, it was horrendous. The Other Way You Can Screw Up After Cutting Being paranoid of weight rebound and gaining a bunch of fat, some individuals will continue to eat on their extremely restricted calorie intake and pound themselves into the ground with cardio to stay shredded. Not only is this extremely unhealthy and will just continue to cause negative metabolic adaptation, but you can actually start fatiguing your central nervous system by operating in such strenuous activities with such a restricted level of energy for a long period of time. Eventually, it will get so bad that even fucking up a little thing on your diet could result in much more amplified fat gains. This is not only physically taxing, but mentally as well. So What Should I Do To Not Disintegrate Into The Dust And Also Not Turn Into A Fatty? REVERSE DIET! I will explain how it works now for you. Essentially, if you cut down in a somewhat safe/smart way you are probably starting in a minor calorie deficit, slowly decreasing your calories as you plateau, and slowly increasing your cardio. If you have no idea what I’m talking about by the “safe/smart way” I suggest you read this first as I outline how to lose fat efficiently with the greatest amount of muscle sparing possible: How To Get Shredded: For Beginners A reverse diet is the exact opposite of this. What you will do in this phase is literally the exact opposite of what you did to cut down. So, by opposite I mean you will SLOWLY REINTRODUCE CALORIES BACK INTO YOUR DIET and SLOWLY DECREASE HOW MUCH CARDIO YOU ARE DOING PER WEEK. By doing this in a slow and controlled manner, you can severely limit how much fat rebound you will experience as you increase your caloric intake, as well as slowly stimulate your metabolism by introducing more energy into your diet, and reducing the energy deficit you were in each day.  As you do this, you will begin to rev your metabolism back up, allowing you to eat a little bit more calories each week, and have your body actually utilize that newly re-introduced energy (calories), consequently getting your energy levels back up, as well as getting your body back to a point where you can maintain a lean physique with a healthy amount of calories in your diet. How Losing Weight Affects Your Metabolism Usually when guys are learning about the mechanics of weight loss, they will get as far as learning the concepts behind energy balance, energy expenditure, and how your body requires a constant state of negative energy balance (caloric deficit) to lose fat. Basically, eating less calories then you burn each day. Usually, if people even get this far with their nutritional knowledge, they assume this is the end of the information they need to know regarding fat loss. How to reverse diet is rarely covered, and accounts for why so many individuals who actually successfully diet down, end up Yo-Yo’ing with their weight loss and will be fat for half the year, and lean for the other half. While they may be cutting down properly, they are certainly not increasing their calorie intake in a responsible way to prevent excessive fat storage. Your body is always trying to reach a state of homeostasis, whether you are bulking or whether you are cutting, so if you eat a predetermined amount of calories every single day for a prolonged period of time, eventually, your body will adapt and that level of energy intake will become your new baseline or maintenance level of energy. Research has shown that 80 to 90% of people that diet to lose weight return to their previous, pre-diet weights! Your body adapting to new baselines of energy isn’t necessarily super dangerous, but it certainly plays a GIANT role in being able to manipulate what your body composition is. Why A Reverse Diet Is The Best Option After A Cutting Phase When you’ve been in a calorie deficit for an extended period of time and you have a weight loss goal or a milestone that you finally reach, your brain is wired psychologically to overeat and indulge. There’s nothing wrong with a cheat meal or anything, by all means reward yourself for reaching your goals, BUT keep in mind your body is literally so primed for weight regain after being in a prolonged state of a calorie deficit that if you overdo it, you WILL absolutely rebound HARD and gain weight like you never imagined you could before. The LAST thing you want to do after a cut phase is drastically raise your daily caloric intake. It must be approached strategically with slow caloric additions to your diet each time you plateau. Where Do I Start? Okay so for example let’s say you started at a maintenance of 3000 calories with no cardio at the start of your cut. Each time you reached a plateau you slowly decreased your calorie intake or increased your cardio each week. By the end of the cut let’s just say you are down to 2000 calories and had to do 4 thirty minute fasted cardio sessions each week to achieve your desired level of leanness. At this point you will add something small like 100 calories back into your daily caloric intake and maybe decrease your cardio sessions by a couple minutes each. You will keep this consistent over the next week or week and a half and assess how your body responds. If you aren’t gaining weight, then it’s safe to decrease the caloric deficit more once again by adding another 100 calories to your daily intake. You will SLOWLY add a tiny bit of calories back into your diet each week or two, and decrease your cardio frequency or length SLOWLY as well, until you have reached a caloric intake that you are content with. If you could get your maintenance back up to 3000 calories without gaining much or any body fat, it is safe to say you properly executed your reverse diet phase to a tee. Ideally, by the end of it you want to be eating a normal level of calories again, without having to do much cardio at all, and maintaining close to the same level of leanness you were at several weeks back in your heavily restricted cut phase. What Macro Do I Increase Each Week? As protein should always be high whether you are bulking or cutting (my protein intake is usually pretty much the exact same, and the only thing that influences my overall caloric intake to determine if I’m at a calorie surplus or deficit is my carb intake, which I increase for bulking, and decrease for cutting) I advise you start reintroducing whatever macro you started to restrict yourself of in your cutting phase to drop your calorie intake each week. Most commonly, guys will start their cut phase with carb restriction, and each week slowly cut more and more carbs out of the diet, thus increasing their caloric deficit. In this case, I would suggest you slowly introduce more carbs back into your diet each week, to slowly build your caloric intake back up again, without allowing yourself to be subjected to drastic weight increases because you will be taking a slow calculated approach to the reverse diet. This method is also commonly referred to as the “clean bulk”. By following a strictly regulated reverse diet, you will get to eat more, have more energy, get a better pump from the increased glycogen saturation in your muscles, and most importantly, speed your metabolic rate back up. Getting your metabolic rate higher will allow you to burn substantially more calories throughout each day, as well as pack on more lean muscle mass. If The Scale Goes Up A Bit, Don’t Worry! As you increase your caloric intake (usually your carb intake), you are going to start saturating your muscles with glycogen, which will in turn also allow them to hold more water, giving your muscle bellies a fuller look. This in turn, will cause the scale to go up a bit. Don’t fret though, these aren't fat gains, this is beneficial weight, as glycogen levels are what are responsible for giving you a good pump in the gym, and giving your muscles that “pop” look. HOWEVER If the scale is jumping by a pound a week or more, you are likely eating too much and need to either taper back the calories a tad before you do your next incremental increase, or you dropped too much cardio too quickly. Hope you guys enjoyed this article 🙂 Don't let all your hard work go to waste next time you cut down!

    "content": "How To Get Shredded For Beginners – Step By Step Guide Explaining EXACTLY How To Diet, Do Your Cardio, Workout, Etc.     How to Get Shredded: For Beginners  There are a lot of misconceptions around getting very lean, and the overall lack of knowledge is one of the main culprits behind why so many people in the world are overweight, even though there are so many regular gym goers. In this first installation of the get shredded series I will cover getting very lean in a more general aspect, making the information more palatable for everyone, even beginners. When you go to your local gym, how many people actually look like they lift weights. By “looking like they lift” I mean they are lean enough that you can adequately see muscular separation, abdominal definition, and have at least a bit of meat on their frame at the same time. It is actually very rare to see someone underneath 10% body fat at all, let alone someone who is that lean and has some mass as well.  In later installations I will delve into more complex and specific topics such as: What you should do to speed your metabolism back up once you have achieved your desired level of leanness, reefed days, metabolism boosting drugs, contest prep, how to peak for a photo shoot or a special event, among a myriad of other relevant topics. “A skinny guy with abs is like a fat girl with big boobs…. It’s not impressive.” I have no idea where I heard that quote but it is kind of true. Anybody can starve themselves and get ripped, but that is NOT the way you should approach your fat loss goals, as you will just end up damaging your metabolism, and strip all the lean muscle mass off your body, leaving you looking like a bone rack. The Key To Getting Shredded Is to slowly restrict your body of energy. While doing this with calorie reduction, weight training, and cardio, you can slowly peel weight off your body without slowing your metabolism down too much, and eventually (and ideally) end up in the middle single digits body fat % wise (4-9) without having sacrificed much (if any) lean muscle mass. It All Boils Down To Overall Caloric Intake Per Day Okay so in simple terms, your body requires calories to give it energy. Your metabolism burns a certain amount of calories/energy each day based upon your body composition, your hormonal profile, your activity level, your age, among a variety of other factors. In order to lose fat, you simply need to eat less (take in less energy) than your body expends each day. If you are functioning on a calorie deficit/energy deficit, your body is burning more calories than it is taking in, consequently it will turn to stored energy to provide it with the energy it needs to fuel the difference of calories during that day’s activities. So for example let’s just say your body burns 3000 calories a day hypothetically, and you are eating 2700 calories each day. You are operating at a calorie deficit of 300 calories, thus your body needs to resort to stored energy (fat stores, glycogen stores and muscle protein stores) to expend those other 300 calories you didn’t provide your body with that day. The disparity between what you eat and what you burn each day creates an energy difference each day which is measured in calories and more or less determines how much fat you lose over time. The Most Common Mistake While Trying To Lose Fat The most common mistake I see is when guys are trying to get shredded they will claim their diet is perfect, but they ask why they aren’t getting leaner. That in itself should tell you your diet isn't perfect! The thing is guys, while eating clean food sources is an extremely important factor in determining your body composition, the actual amount of calories you take in each day is what will ultimately determine how much fat you lose or don’t lose. 99% of these guys who claim their diet is in check don’t actually eat at a caloric deficit, and that is why they simply won’t lose weight ever, even if their diet is 100% clean and they are getting all their calories from plain chicken, rice and broccoli. This situation above is the main reason why so many people have unsuccessful diet attempts. YOU NEED TO COUNT YOUR CALORIES IF YOU WANT TO GET RIPPED  Sure you can maybe get away with eating clean and losing weight without counting calories, but then you’re basically taking shots in the dark with your diet, and aren’t taking a calculated efficient approach to your dieting efforts. Anybody who simply eats clean and gets as lean as they want without counting calories at all is actually still in a caloric deficit, they may just be unaware of it because they don’t count their calories and their positive results are essentially accidental.  As a result, they could lose weight too fast and lose more muscle than they should, or lose weight very slowly because their caloric deficit is too small, or they could not lose weight at all if they aren’t calorie counting and they are eating a greater than or equal amount of calories to their Basal Metabolic Rate (the level of calories your body will maintain its’ weight on). Basal Metabolic Rate is more commonly referred to as your “BMR” or your “Maintenance” by a lot of guys.  Having an accurate food scale for measuring out and counting your calorie intake per day will soon become your greatest weapon used to wage war on fat. Knowing exactly what your calorie intake is each meal per day will let you know if you are achieving your calorie intake requirements of each day necessary for fat loss. Click HERE for an accurate digital scale Can I Get Shredded Using “If It Fits Your Macros” Dieting As Long As I Count My Calories? Your body can’t tell the difference between the calories of a donut and the calories in a clean food source. Because of this, your body will still lose the same amount of weight on the scale regardless if your calories are all coming from twinkies or if they are all coming from clean whole food sources.  If a calorie deficit is maintained, you will lose fat regardless of diet composition. So yes you can get shredded eating shitty food…. HOWEVER!!!!!!!! That absolutely doesn't mean that macronutrient ratios or food quality doesn’t matter. They definitely do, and if you eat shitty food to hit your calorie goals, you will more likely than not suffer performance wise in the gym by losing way more muscle than you should.  Figuring Out Your Energy Intake First thing you will want to do is calculate your BMR if you don’t already know what that is. This must factor in your estimated activity level as well. You can easily find on Google several BMR calculators that will roughly let you know how many calories your body expends each day while still taking into account how much exercise you complete each week. I’m not gonna lie, I find these calculators very hit or miss, and they can be off by up to +/- 500 calories at times which can cause significant confusion when you try to create your diet and you lose weight too fast, don’t lose weight at all, or start gaining weight. I suggest if you are actually clueless about your BMR you use the calculator to figure it out, BUT, in order to ensure you actually find your BMR with a much higher level of accuracy, I suggest you eat a calorie intake equivalent to that of your calculated maintenance level calories for the first week of your diet. This week will be used as a “feeler” week to assess how off the calculator was from your actual BMR. For example, if the calculator says your maintenance is 3000 calories, and you eat 3000 calories everyday for a week straight but you lose 2 pounds, then it is obvious that the calculator was off by a decent amount and you can then adjust your caloric intake accordingly relative to what your actual BMR most likely is. Or if the calculator says your maintenance is 3000 and you eat at 3000 everyday for a week and you lose no weight, nor gain any weight, then it can be concluded that 3000 calories is indeed your actual maintenance level of calories. See what I mean. It is very useful to find this number as close as possible because then you can be much more accurate when calculating your macro and calorie intake each day, and know what to expect results wise at the end of each week. Once you figure out with a somewhat close level of accuracy what your maintenance/BMR is, then you can create your fat loss diet and figure out what you will be eating each day. This is the calculator that I recommend – Maintenance Calorie Calculator (I Recommend Using The Mifflin-St Jeor Formula Option In The Advanced Options Section)  As this article is for beginners, I will assume you haven’t calorie counted at all before, or if you have then you are already ahead of the game and know a bit more what to expect. So What Should I Start My Calorie Intake At? Calculate your BMR and Subtract 200-300 calories from this number I approach fat loss the same way I approach bulking up. Slow and steady. You will be surprised just how fast you can cut fat with a calculated and educated approach to the process. I feel that a 500 calorie deficit or greater is simply too large of a deficit to start out at for a natural athlete as you will be sacrificing more muscle mass at a quicker rate. You will get leaner faster, but you will also lose lean muscle at a faster rate. If you don’t have an impending deadline that is super close, I suggest you take a longer approach to fat loss with a slow and steady reduction of calories to preserve more muscle, and prolong the cut to negate as much of the potential catabolism as you can. If you take 300 calories off your maintenance and start there, the scale will start going down and you will notice a reduction in body fat. I suggest only increasing your calorie deficit once you plateau.  When your weight loss plateaus, then you can choose at that time to either add another cardio session to your weekly routine, increase the length of your current cardio sessions (cardio burns calories), or decrease your caloric intake by another 100-200 calories.  These will all increase the disparity between your daily caloric intake and your maintenance calories, consequently breaking a weight loss plateau. Through this continuous process of slowly adding in more cardio and slowly reducing your daily caloric intake each time you plateau, you can continue to get leaner and bust plateaus without wrecking your metabolism and getting stuck spinning your wheels. How much cardio should I do and when should I do it? Obviously this will be determined more by your availability then when it is optimal, as if you have a full time job or a very tight schedule, you may not be able to do your cardio and weight training at optimal times.  The most important thing you must consider is your overall energy expenditure each day in relation to your energy intake (caloric intake). While it is most beneficial to complete your cardio in a fasted state right upon waking up, if it doesn’t fit your schedule, it is far more important that you simply get it done at some point in the day then not doing it at all because you couldn’t do it at the “optimal time of day”. However, if your schedule allows it, the best time to do your cardio is first thing in the morning upon waking on an empty stomach as your glycogen stores will be most depleted at this point as you have not taken in any energy yet for the day (you haven’t ate yet and have been essentially fasting in your sleep), thus your body will tap into stored fat to provide the energy it needs to get through the cardio session. The second best time of day to do your cardio is immediately post-workout. This works in the same fashion, where your strenuous resistance training with weights will deplete your body of stored glycogen, putting your body in a state where if you were to do cardio immediately after lifting weights, it would need to tap into some stored fat storage in order to fuel the cardio session. If you do cardio at this time it is essential that you don’t have your post-workout meal until AFTER your post-workout cardio session if you want to maximize the fat burning potential of the cardio session. Regarding how much you do, this will be determined by how much fat you need to lose, as well as how you respond to a caloric deficit. I would start off with something easy like one or two 25 minute steady state cardio sessions each week, keeping your heart rate around 140 beats per minute for the duration of each session. Ideally, you would do each session fasted upon waking or post-workout, but they can be completed at any time of the day. As long as you get them in is the most important thing. Once weight loss plateaus you can either add another 5 minutes to each cardio session, or you can throw another cardio session in each week. How fast your metabolism is will determine how low your calories will need to go and how long and frequent your cardio will eventually need to get to get very very lean. Having More Lean Muscle Mass Means You Can Lose Fat Easier As an individual with a larger amount of lean muscle mass than the average male, I can usually get to 8-9 % body fat with only a couple cardio sessions each week for 25-30 minutes. For someone with substantially less muscle, they may need to be doing cardio every single day for 40 minutes per session to get that lean. This solidifies why it’s very important to take measures to maintain as much muscle mass as you can while cutting down, as simply having more muscle on your body in itself will make your body burn more calories even when you are doing nothing, making getting lean a much easier feat. Should I Use Anabolics To Help Maintain My Muscle During A Cut Phase? This is entirely up to you, but any supplement or drug that delivers anabolic benefits above and beyond what your body can deliver naturally will help you maintain a substantial amount more muscle during your cut phase (or even all of it), thus allowing you to get leaner much easier, and have a more favorable body composition by the end of the cut phase with more muscle on your frame than you would have ended up with otherwise. I’m not advocating it by any means, but there is no denying the benefit it would have in a strict cutting regimen operating on a caloric deficit. How Should My Training Style Change When Cutting Vs Bulking? It shouldn’t change at all. In fact, you should try and keep everything exactly the same as when you are bulking. If you start going lighter with higher reps on purpose because you think it’s going to carve more detail into your muscle, you are going to quickly lose strength and lose muscle density. Keep your weights the same and try and maintain your strength throughout your entire cut if possible in order to maintain the maximum amount of muscle mass you can. Is Fasted Cardio Really Better Then Doing Cardio With Food In Your System? There are arguments and science to back up both claims. Some would argue that the thermogenic effects of calories in your body increasing your temperature will actually allow you to burn more fat than you would normally be able to in a fasted state, while others argue that completing cardio in a glycogen depleted state is the most ideal choice for maximizing fat burning. While both are valid arguments, I have found from my own personal experience that fasted cardio DOES actually burn more fat than cardio with food in your system. I don’t have lab studies to back me up or anything, but I get leaner easier when I incorporate fasted sessions vs. fed sessions so I will stick to what has worked for me, and I suggest you do fasted/glycogen depleted cardio if your schedule allows for it as well. THE PERFECT MACROS FOR FAT-LOSS Now that you know how many calories you're supposed to eat every day, you need to decide how to break those calories down into each of the 3 individual macro-nutrients. Basically, let’s say you have a calorie goal for the day of 2700 calories. Of those calories, you will want to set aside a percentage of those calories to protein, carbs, and fats. While many will argue the benefits of different types of dieting such as ketogenic diets, paleo diets, carb-cycling diets, super high protein no fat no carb diets, etc. You need to try them and see what you respond best to. This isn’t the answer you want to hear I’m sure but I’m telling you guys, the sooner you start experimenting with diets, the sooner you will learn how your body best responds, and then you can use that method every time. The last thing you want to do is follow a predetermined macro split that is so general that it doesn’t even take into account the intensity of your training, how much muscle you have, how fat you are right now, etc. Some people who offer advice will simply say something as general as (ok take your calories and have 40% of those from protein, 40% from carbs, and 20% from fats and that is the perfect macro split). Then the less knowledgeable readers will blindly follow this general suggestion under the impression that it is under every circumstance the best macro split no matter what.  Don’t do this! By all means, try that split if you want, and if it works to your satisfaction stick to it in the future if you want to. But I HIGHLY SUGGEST you try different styles of diets over the years so you know what your body best responds to. For me for example, I actually respond best to medium-high protein, high carbs, and zero fat. Don’t ask me why, but I burn way more fat at a much quicker rate when I have moderate-high carbs in my diet as opposed to low/no carbs and high fats. I also retain more of my muscle mass than when my carb intake is low. I tried a keto diet once and lost fat at a much slower rate than I had with a carb-cycling approach and lost a pile of muscle. However, I know TONNS of guys who respond AMAZING to ketogenic diets. As a matter of fact, most of the guys on the forum I moderate have had their best fat loss results using ketogenic diets. For simplicity purposes for beginners, my suggestion is to pick a diet style and stick to that for the duration of your cut. Remember, that overall caloric intake will ultimately determine for the most part how much fat you lose, so the macro portioning is more for ensuring you lose the least amount of muscle possible, keep your strength up, and feel good and your digestion is on point. If you are a Type I Diabetic for example obviously it isn’t as cut and dry as me saying follow this split and it will give you the optimal fat burning and muscle retention possible. There are individual specific factors that come into play. In general though:  If you are very overweight with lots of body fat and don’t have much muscle to begin with, you would probably benefit most from a ketogenic diet (high protein and fat, with no carbs except trace ones from leafy greens and veggies). For someone with more muscle on their frame and less fat to lose, they can most likely benefit most from a program that involves some sort of carbs, whether it be cycling carbs using high carb days/low fat, medium protein on large body part training days like back and legs, and low carbs on smaller less demanding days with medium fats high protein for days like arm days or shoulder training days, and zero carbs on non-training days with high fat high protein. Or even a totally ketogenic diet with a weekly reefed day where you replenish your glycogen stores with high carbs and low fats and medium protein to preserve your muscle tissue. Consistently moderate-high carb diets with medium-high protein and low fats usually work best for those who are already pretty lean and have very fast metabolisms from having a lot of muscle mass that burns through calories at a substantially greater rate than the average male and engage in very intense heavy lifting sessions 5+ times per week.  How hard, heavy, and frequently you train, how fat you are, and how much muscle you have on your body already should all be factors you take into consideration before determining what type of diet you will be following. The importance of protein in your diet Protein is very hyped up with a lot of people advocating high amounts of protein in cutting diets to help preserve muscle mass.  While it is very important, you by no means have to follow the strict guidelines set out in a lot of bodybuilding circles as prerequisites for your diet to not be considered inadequate or lacking. I do suggest definitely having a higher protein intake in grams per day relative to your body weight (X grams of protein per pound body weight) than you would in a bulk phase though, as high protein content in a diet is very necessary for muscular preservation in a calorie deficit. If you were eating a gram per pound of body weight during your bulk phase for example, I would recommend bumping that up to 1.5-2 grams per pound bodyweight during your cut phase. While you may still respond differently than I anticipate to this high of a protein content in your diet, in general it is more than likely that keeping your protein content high is the safest of the three macros to keep in the high range in a calorie deficit as it directly will help prevent muscle protein breakdown when your body seeks energy from stored sources in your body (your muscles, glycogen stores, and the fat stores in your body). When your body seeks energy to sustain itself and it turns to stored protein in the muscle for sustenance, having a high protein content in your diet will give your body more daily energy to tap into of protein so it won’t need to resort to breaking down as much stored muscle tissue. What kind of foods should I be eating and how do I avoid cravings and binging? Your diet should be comprised of the same clean foods you eat during your bulk phase, just less of them to allow you to be in a caloric deficit. For suggested bodybuilding foods my friend Chris from Goodlookingloser has already compiled an assortment of in depth lists of foods for you to refer to. These should help you pick exactly which brands of each type of food will be optimal to use to build your daily diet. Check out each of the links below for articles he has written on this subject: Best Foods For Weight Loss List of Complex Carbs That Are Best for Gaining Muscle The Best Vegetables to Eat and Why The Best Fruits to Eat and Why Tricks you should incorporate to prevent yourself from getting off-track on your diet Keep yourself full and satiated so you don’t cheat on your diet. Picking fibrous carbs is a good plan of attack as it will satiate you easier and leave you feeling fuller. When you are full, you don’t have the desire to grab that bag of cookies in the cupboard and slam 100 of them in 10 minutes. Also, having lots of leafy greens and other extremely low calorie veggies will allow you to eat a higher quantity of food, without pushing your calorie intake past your daily goals. When I get really hungry, I like to incorporate a giant salad into my daily meal plan as it is literally like 50 calories for a giant bowl of lettuce, spinach, and other greens and veggies, but it gets me really full and prevents me from getting cravings. Also, if you are having crazy sugar cravings, by all means treat yourself to a diet pop.  These calorie free drinks will not affect your weight loss, and are a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth when you’re dieting. I have diet orange crush almost every single day when I’m trying to get really lean. In the near future, I will cover some awesome low calorie recipes for quality and actually good tasting meals you can implement into your fat loss diet that will leave you feeling satiated, and you will actually enjoy eating (yes chicken and rice can get boring I know). Will Fat Burners Help? Yes if your budget allows it, a good fat burner will not only increase the amount of calories your body burns through each day, but it will provide you with appetite suppression that can be helpful in maintaining the willpower to avoid cheating on your diet. What If I Do Everything Correctly But Still Can’t Lose Weight? I suggest getting blood work done to see if you have a hormonal deficiency. Occasionally, some men and women will go years with hormonal deficiencies and not even know it because they had no idea there was something wrong in the first place. If you suspect you may have a hormonal deficiency, I highly recommend you go get a thorough analysis of your endocrine system (check for inadequate testosterone levels, excessive estrogen levels, prolactin levels, etc.) as well as analysis of your thyroid function. Lower than normal testosterone production or hypothyroidism could both lead to significantly more fat being stored on you than you would have otherwise, as well as less lean muscle tissue than you would have with normal testosterone levels.  Sometimes, diagnosing an underlying condition and being properly medicated could be enough to fix any issues you may have had in the past with losing stubborn fat. My next article in this installation Will cover what you should do once you have achieved your desired level of leanness. It is necessary to try and speed your metabolism back up SLOWLY in order to allow yourself to eat more food, while staying lean, as you simply cannot be at optimal health living your life in a severe calorie deficit forever. I will cover in depth how you can complete this process once your fat loss phase is done via something called “Reverse Dieting”  Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

It is categorized as a SARM because of its unique selectivity at the androgen receptor where it exhibits a significant amount of anabolic activity in the body relative to androgenic activity. It is being researched to determine if it is a potential treatment for the management of muscle and bone wasting diseases. This article covers Ostarine's potential therapeutic applications, dosages, side effects, and anecdotal findings based on my own personal research.   Table of Contents ToggleWhat Is Ostarine?

Ostarine, also known as Enobosarm, GTx-024 and MK-2866, is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM). SARMs, like Ostarine, stimulate androgen receptors in a selective way, whereby they induce a significantly greater amount of anabolic activity in the body relative to androgenic activity [R]. Testosterone was the first anabolic androgen to be approved for use in a clinical setting, however, its scope of versatility has always been severely limited by its androgenicity and its pharmacokinetic issues. Most notable being its lack of selectivity for muscle tissue to other androgen affected tissues like the prostate, and not being orally bioavailable [R]. Testosterone has a 2:1 selectivity for muscle to prostate [R].  This lack of selectivity disqualifies Testosterone entirely in a clinical setting for treating women, as well as men in many scenarios, due to the significant androgenic activity that would occur at a systemic level during the attempted management of muscle or bone wasting diseases. This is where SARMs like Ostarine display such promise as viable alternatives [R]. The ideal anabolic agent should demonstrate anabolic selectivity in muscle and bone without suppressing luteinizing hormone (LH), not negatively interact with other steroid receptors in the body, exhibit a high level of oral bioavailability without being 17 alpha-alkylated, and avoid 5-alpha reduction to DHT and aromatization into Estrogen [R]. SARMs were first discovered in 1998, following which several different compounds were developed by a variety of pharmaceutical companies in order to find a viable compound to satisfy this obvious need in degenerative disease treatment [R]. Ostarine's Mechanism Of Action By exhibiting such a favorable selectivity for stimulating increases in muscle tissue and strength relative to androgenic activity in affected tissues, Ostarine has the potential advantage that it could be used at relatively low doses, is orally bioavailable, and could potentially circumvent some of the negative effects that stem from traditionally used anabolic Steroids converting to 5α-reduced androgens in modern medicine that may raise the risk of benign prostate hyperplasia, accelerate the development of prostate carcinoma, increase the probability of acne breakouts, and exacerbate/substantially expedite androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness). It could also potentially eliminate the incidence of androgenic side effects in women entirely, while still potentially inducing enough anabolic activity to offset any muscle or bone loss occurring from degenerative disease. While this is beneficial for both men and woman, its lack of androgenicity in women makes this a very promising anabolic agent. Even minor amounts of androgens can cause virilization, making it extremely difficult to find compounds potent enough to offset degenerative diseases with no side effects in women. Not only does Ostarine increase muscle mass and strength, it increases tendon strength, ligament health, bone density and encourages collagen turn-over [R, R]. Percentage change of lean body mass from baseline to end of study It also has good oral bioavailability [R]. This makes oral dosing viable as opposed to intramuscular injection with traditional anabolic steroids (an obviously less practical method of medicinal intervention), or oral dosing with 17 alpha-alkylated anabolic steroids that are liver toxic and require a methyl or ethyl group, at the C17α position to be orally bioavailable. Ostarine was the closest SARM to making it through clinical trials and being approved. Ostarine Clinical Trials Enobosarm (Ostarine) Pipeline Ostarine was the first drug to be put on the FDA's fast track development program to become an approved drug for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with cancer. In mid 2013, GTx announced that Ostarine had failed its late-stage phase III trials as a lung cancer drug intended to prevent muscle wasting [R]. In these trials, 325 patients were given 3 mg of Ostarine per day, or placebo (randomized trial), to assess if Ostarine would significantly prevent muscle loss in those who received the 3 mg dosage, vs those that didn't. Power during a stair climb test was also used as a measure to assess improvements in physical function. Secondary endpoints included an assessment of whether patients who were treated with Ostarine had any improvement in their quality of life, or if they required less healthcare resources than the placebo group. While the trial was a failure overall, the positive takeaway was that Enobosarm (Ostarine) demonstrated significant quantitative advantage in LBM (lean body mass) compared to placebo in both trials [R]. In layman's terms, Ostarine on average increased or maintained a significantly greater amount of muscle mass in the patients that were treated with it, relative to those who were treated with placebo. Following that, in 2016 GTx started a phase II clinical trial to assess Ostarine's viability as a stress urinary incontinence treatment for women.  The results of that did not achieve statistical significance [R]. Looking at the results of Ostarine in totality across all of its clinical trials, we can make a more educated assessment on its viability for the purposes of selective increases in muscle mass relative to androgenic activity. Ostarine has been evaluated in 27 completed or ongoing clinical trials. About 1500 subjects in total have been treated with Ostarine in some capacity, with dosages ranging from as low as 0.1 mg all the way up to 100 mg. Ostarine was observed to be generally safe and well tolerated in all of those trials. One notable Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated Ostarine as a form of hormonal therapy for women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and androgen receptor positive (AR+) breast cancer was broken down into two dose cohorts (9 mg and 18 mg daily). The Phase 2 trial pre-specified threshold for success, clinical benefit response (CBR), was attained meeting the trial’s primary efficacy endpoint. The trial enrolled the predefined number of evaluable patients in both dosage arms with at least 44 patients in each of two cohorts receiving 9 mg or 18 mg daily doses of Ostarine (Enobosarm) respectively [R, R]. This study in particular presented the first opportunity for us to gather clinical data representing what results would occur from what would generally be considered “high dosages” of Ostarine. Is Ostarine As Strong As Steroids? While Ostarine did help me reach my goal I set for myself, I absolutely do not think that it is as strong as most steroids are (in certain contexts). However, I think it does have the ability to match the same level of anabolic activity that moderate doses of certain “milder” steroids provide. Anavar and Primobolan come to mind when I think of good steroids to compare the results to. With Ostarine displaying a blatant dose dependent increase in muscle mass, it would be desirable to investigate where the point of diminishing returns is in humans with regards to increases in lean muscle mass, as dosages as low as 10-25 mg of Ostarine are commonly compared to 50-100 mg dosages of traditional anabolic androgenic steroids, which is obviously a ridiculous way to assess overall potency relative to one another. 10 mg of Ostarine will outperform 10 mg of Anavar, Turinabol, Primobolan, Equipoise, and many other traditional anabolic steroids, with a favorable selectivity for anabolic:androgenic activity, and less endocrine suppression. Ostarine Vs Nandrolone Milligram:Milligram, Ostarine is multiple times more effective at increasing lean muscle mass than Nandrolone, a very commonly used anabolic androgenic steroid. More commonly known as “Deca” (Nandrolone with the Decanoate ester) or “NPP” (Nandrolone with the phenylpropionate ester).  1) Change in LBM at 6 months in hip fracture patients. 2) Myostatin antibody. Change in LBM at 12 weeks in older weak fallers. 3) Change in LBM at 12 weeks in men and women >60 yrs old. Ostarine Vs Anavar I truly believe that Ostarine is stronger than Anavar now. When I first started experimenting with SARMs, I was hesitant to imply that it could be as strong as any anabolic steroid that has a notable androgenic effect in the body, as I simply did not think it would be possible to stack up against any of them. Throughout countless anecdotal experiences now, I have personally seen Ostarine mg:mg outperform Anavar in terms of sheer muscle and strength increases, as well as in terms of side effects. Ostarine is less suppressive than Anavar, outperforms it in an anabolic capacity, and displays a significantly lower incidence of side effects and androgenic activity in the body. For women especially, after seeing multiple women try Anavar and Ostarine on separate occasions, Ostarine always outperformed the Anavar and appears to clearly be the candidate of choice when it comes to performance enhancement. How Ostarine Stacks Up Against Other SARMs Ostarine has the most clinical data available, so one would generally jump to the conclusion that it is the best overall SARM, however, I feel that is not necessarily the case and should be explored further. Ostarine Vs LGD-4033 While Ostarine exhibits a blatantly favorable selectivity for muscle tissue to prostate (and other androgen affected tissues), in comparison to LGD-4033 it is outperformed in almost all aspects. Milligram:Milligram LGD-4033 (VK5211) outperforms Ostarine (Enobosarm) with greater increases in lean muscle mass and strength. Despite LGD-4033 being more potent, Ostarine is less suppressive, which would make recovering natural testosterone levels a smoother and quicker process after discontinuation. 1) Change in LBM at 6 months in hip fracture patients. 2) Myostatin antibody. Change in LBM at 12 weeks in older weak fallers. 3) Change in LBM at 12 weeks in men and women >60 yrs old. Ostarine Vs S4 (Andarine) Ostarine's effect on muscle tissue and overall body composition is most similar to Andarine (also called GTx-007, S-4). Milligram:Milligram, Ostarine is stronger than S4 for building lean muscle mass, however, it does not seem to have the same cosmetic drying out effect of the physique that S4 provides. Ostarine also has the obvious advantage of not binding to the ocular receptors in the eyes, which is the biggest detriment to S4's potential applications, whereby it causes notable vision impairment in dark settings. S4 however has less of a detriment to HDL cholesterol levels than Ostarine. Ostarine and S4 are reported to have great synergy with one another when used concurrently, with several users accomplishing very impressive body composition transformations with the combination. Ostarine Vs S-1 Ostarine is commonly mistaken as S-1, but it should be noted that (S)-3-(4-chloro-3-fluorophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(4-nitro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)propionamide (C-6), also called S-1 was one of the earliest SARMs developed, and is far weaker than Ostarine [R]. Ostarine Dosage Predictably, Ostarine caught the attention of the bodybuilding industry with its impressive pre-clinical profile and blatant potential advantages in a performance enhancement context. While Ostarine was initially trialed at 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, and 3 mg per day, it is not well known that dosages of 9 mg and 18 mg per day were generally well tolerated by women in a less commonly known phase II clinical trial [R, R, R]. Lean gains upwards of 5 – 10 pounds are typical among recreational users, with average dosages ranging from 10 – 25 mg per day. These dosages were determined by recreational users based upon anecdotal logs and personal experimentation, and are not concrete guidelines that dictate correct or incorrect use. Ostarine Side Effects Decreased Good Cholesterol (HDL) The clinical data on this is inconsistent as there are some studies that show reductions in serum lipids (namely HDL and LDL) occurring in a dose dependent manner with Ostarine usage, as well as data showing only reductions in HDL levels (otherwise known as “good cholesterol”) [R, R]. We at least know for sure that Ostarine has a negative effect on HDL levels, which is notable as this is a common side effect of all traditional anabolic steroids, and other SARMs. Despite SARMs ability to avoid significant androgenic activity in the body, they evidently do not differ much from anabolic steroids in their effects on lipid profiles. Testosterone Suppression  SARMs have shown to suppress luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, thus decreasing testosterone in a dose-dependent manner [R]. Ostarine has also shown to significantly lower Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) and serum total testosterone levels in clinical trials in subjects treated with 1 mg of Ostarine or higher [R]. While SHBG was always significantly impacted at notable dosages, suppression of LH and FSH wasn't consistently proven throughout Ostarine's clinical trials. However, after referencing anecdotal logs of baseline pre-Ostarine blood work compared to mid-Ostarine blood work with dosages several times higher than the 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg dosages used in trials (users commonly use Ostarine at upwards of 25 mg per day for several months), I believe it's safe to say that Ostarine does also show blatant reductions in all of these hormones markers in a dose dependent manner, the dosages in the studies just weren't high enough to yield this data. The degree to which even high dosages of Ostarine suppress LH and FSH is far less than that of traditional anabolic steroids though, which should be noted. The process of recovering to baseline healthy endocrine function would be hindered to a far greater extent in steroid users. Elevated Estrogen Or Decreased Estrogen Ostarine does not aromatize into Estrogen directly, however, via the suppression of natural Testosterone levels, it can create an unfavorable balance between Testosterone and Estrogen in the body. In addition, by occupying the androgen receptor with such a high affinity, Ostarine can actually divert a significant amount of Testosterone to aromatize into Estrogen that wouldn't have otherwise. This in turn, can create an elevation of Estrogen levels in the body, which is commonly mistaken as the compound being laced with prohormones, or being an anabolic steroid. Common symptoms of high estrogen include:  Acne, oily skin Erectile dysfunction Low libido Lethargy Gynecomastia (man boobs) Irritability Depression Water retention High blood pressure Enlarged prostate Shrunken testicles Sugar cravings  While Ostarine can cause an elevation in Estrogen via the increased aromatization of circulating Testosterone, long-term use, or high dosages of Ostarine can cause an opposite effect, where the body has such a low level of circulating Testosterone via endocrine suppression that you no longer have enough aromatization occurring in the body, leading to an array of health problems derived from the lack of Estrogen needed to fulfill certain physiological functions. Common symptoms of low estrogen include:  Dull weak orgasms Dry skin and lips Dehydration Erectile dysfunction Low libido Irritability Mood swings Loss of appetite Fatigue Lethargy  Applications In Alternative Hormone Replacement Therapy In Men As Ostarine does not aromatize into Estrogen, it disqualifies it as a viable form of standalone hormone replacement therapy in men. A variety of basic physiological functions in men rely on the aromatization of Testosterone into Estrogen, as low Estrogen side effects can be just as harmful to one's health as high Estrogen side effects. In hypothetical long-term HRT applications, Ostarine would likely need to be used in conjunction with exogenous Estrogen to maintain in range blood serum concentrations to fulfill basic physiological functions that otherwise would be dependent on the body's endogenous aromatization of Testosterone to Estrogen. Androgenic Activity Ostarine has a dose dependent increase in androgen activity in the body. While it is extremely selective for muscle and bone relative to androgen affected tissues, all SARMs (Ostarine included) display a systemic increase in androgen activity, hence there is still potential for androgen related side effects, just to a far lesser extent. The ratio of anabolic:androgenic activity is favorable enough whereby the therapeutic dose necessary to yield the desired level of muscle retention and bone mass would ideally not be high enough where any notable androgenic activity could take place, and that the drug would still be generally well tolerated with a great safety profile. Establishing the balance between all of these factors is the reason why no SARM has yet been approved for human use, as it is very difficult to develop a compound with a substantial amount of anabolic activity, with a near complete absence of androgenic activity. Hair Loss All androgens can cause hair follicle miniaturization, the extent to which they do this is dependent on their individual selectivity, binding affinity, and the dosage used. In general, Ostarine (at the dosages commonly used) would not cause any notable androgenic alopecia. However, this does not exclude temporary shedding caused by a hormonal fluctuation. Anything that causes a hormonal fluctuation in the body, can potentially cause a temporary shed. This is not to be confused with androgenic alopecia, but it is hair loss nonetheless, albeit temporary. Liver Toxicity Short-lived increases in ALT to above the upper limit of normal were observed in eight subjects in one of Ostarine's clinical trials. The ALT observations in seven of eight subjects had resolved while still continuing their daily dosage, and no subject had clinically significant abnormal levels of ALT or AST at the end of study. One subject was discontinued due to an elevation in ALT 4.2 times the upper limit of normal. The ALT level in that subject returned to normal levels after discontinuation of the Ostarine [R]. This was with dosages of no higher than 3 mg per day, so it is only logical to assume that common recreational dosages of Osatarine (upwards of 25 mg) may exhibit some level of liver enzyme elevation. This is contradictory to common broscience theories that assert that there is zero chance of liver toxicity from SARMs at any dosage amount, or that an increase in ALT in their blood work must mean that they received methylated prohormones instead of SARMs. At therapeutic dosages, there appears to be a low risk profile, but it should be noted that there may be some notable degree of liver toxicity at dosages commonly used for performance enhancement, which would likely resolve itself after cycling off. Lack Of Aromatization And 5-Alpha Reduction Ostarine does not aromatize or create a layer of subcutaneous water retention. Increases in lean muscle mass are absent of artificially inflated water weight, not only making the SARM favorable from a cosmetic standpoint in a clinical setting, but also from a health standpoint, as water retention induced from previously approved anabolic androgenic steroids like Anadrol can often lead to increased cardiovascular stress, increased heart rate and blood pressure, electrolyte imbalances, among a myriad of other issues. More importantly, the lack of aromatization limits potential side effects that could occur from aromatization from traditional anabolic steroids like Testosterone. Ostarine does not undergo 5-alpha reduction, which is speculated to contribute to its sparing effect on the prostate and other androgen related tissue. This is not the case though, as there are several androgens that do not undergo conversion to a more androgenic compound when they hit 5α-Reductase. One of the most notable being MENT (Trestolone). In fact, some androgens are more androgenic prior to 5-alpha reduction, and present an increase in androgenic side effects when they are inhibited with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors like Finasteride or Dutasteride. An example of this is Nandrolone.  Ostarine is inherently selective for the androgen receptor, and its selectivity for muscle tissue and bone relative to androgen affected tissues like prostate is not a result of its inability to be altered by 5-alpha reductase. Half-Life  Ostarine has a half-life of 23.8 hours, making once per day dosing a viable option for maintaining stable blood serum concentrations [R]. Ostarine PCT (Post Cycle Therapy) Ostarine will suppress natural Testosterone levels (and overall endocrine function) in a dose dependent manner. It is wise to complete a PCT phase (post-cycle therapy) after an Ostarine cycle. Due to Ostarine's half-life, PCT should be started the day after the last Ostarine dosage was taken. Forgoing PCT will put one at risk of muscle loss, fat gain, among all of the other standard side effects associated with Testosterone suppression. If you are dead set on using performance enhancing drugs shortly after Ostarine, I would not advise following the broscience derived “time on = time off” equation. Time off should be dictated by a variety of more individual specific factors, and blood work.

    "content": "Starting Out At the Gym Forum Question Response     Starting Out At the Gym This post was made by “opengrip” on the goodlookingloser forums asking how he should approach starting out in the gym: So I wanna put on some muscle and bulk up a little bit. I'm naturally 5'6 125lbs but fairly athletic already. Problem is I haven't worked out since I was in highschool and most of the time in highschool i worked out at a friends place so I'm not 100% sure how to approach this gym life. I know there is lots of you guys in here that definitely know your way around this and can probably point me in the right direction. First off what kind of attire should i be looking for? Regarding gym attire, the number one thing you want to make sure is whatever you are wearing is comfortable and allows you to use a full range of motion in all your movements. It should go without saying that you don’t want to be wearing a pair of skinny jeans to go do squats in. Usually, I will wear a tank and shorts or track pants and some comfortable runners. A few brands that I actually do recommend if you are a serious lifter are GASP clothing, doyoueven clothing, strongliftwear, as well as Nike and Under Armor. They have clothing specifically designed to be flattering on built physiques, as well as EXTREMELY comfortable.  Although not necessary at all, I for one like to see the muscles I’m training when I’m in the gym and wear flattering clothing that shows off my physique and my progress. It actually helps me perform better when I get a confidence boost from wearing something that looks good on me.     Any places you guys recommend shopping and how much am I gonna look at spending on this stuff? I recommend you check aliexpress.com Aliexpress has a lot of clothing made in China that looks as good as the real brand name stuff, but is sold at less than half the price. I get most of my stuff from there now. If you don’t have a bunch of disposable income to waste on gym clothes, I suggest you just wear clothes you already have around the house. You can always cut a t-shirt into a muscle shirt or something, you don’t need to be on top of your style game at the gym it’s the last place you should be worrying about how stylish you look.  2nd what sort of exercises should i be doing to achieve a bulkier build… I dont wanna be body builder big but more like super model fit. Nice abs slightly bigger chest and biceps etc. Is there any apps that I should look into for tracking my progress or help with learning the equipment? It doesn’t matter if you want a bodybuilder body or a super model body, you will need to do the same kind of exercises to build your physique in a proportional way. This means training like a bodybuilder, and eating like a “super model” is what you will want to be doing if you want a super model physique (you won’t grow as big as a bodybuilder, if you don’t eat like a bodybuilder, period).  I suggest you watch YouTube tutorials regarding the exercises you need to be doing so you can learn proper form for each exercise, or go with someone knowledgeable who can help you start out without injuring yourself. Start extremely light and taper up your weights slowly, as you will likely have muscular imbalances and have problems with your form that need correcting before you can start really focusing on increasing the weights by a lot.  The type of workout split you follow should be determined by you and how much you want to train each body part each week, but I suggest for the body you want to have a day dedicated each day of the week for each body part at least. This means training 5x per week, with one for chest, one for back, one for shoulders and traps, one for arms, and one for legs, with two rest days. This is a suggestion but in no means does this mean that this split will be optimal for you (although it is an effective one) and you may very well find that a different kind of split (like push day, pull day, legs, rest) might work better for your results. Regarding the exercises you do in each particular day, those will largely become dictated by how well your body responds to each exercise. I don’t even do flat barbell bench press even though it’s one of the main compound recommended exercises because I get injured easily doing it, and I don’t get very good results from it, so I usually opt for a hammer strength machine or flat dumbbell presses instead which helps my physique develop more. Although I can’t tell you which exercises will work best for you, I can tell you that you need to mix up the angles. Hitting the muscle from every angle is necessary before you finish your workout if you want to adequately hit the entire muscle. For chest for example, you will want to do incline movements, flat movements, a decline movement, and some fly type movements. This ensures you hit the muscle group from all possible angles. On shoulder day as another example, you will not only want to hit the front delt, but the side and rear delts as well. Neglecting one area of a specific muscle group will result in an imbalanced physique that not only looks worse, but will increase your likelihood of injury. As far as rep ranges go, you might as well keep it simple and start out with the classic 4 sets per exercise, with 8-12 reps per exercise. If you can do 12 reps with PERFECT form with the weight with no assistance, then it is too light and you need to increase the weight. Although overloading the muscle is important, it is just as important to use proper form, and contract the muscle on each rep. If you are just lifting the weight up and down but don't actually feel the muscle being worked that you are trying to train with that particular exercise, you are doing something wrong and should re-evaluate your form or the weights you are using. In addition to overloading the muscle, you want to GET A PUMP in the gym. Stretching the fascia by engorging the muscle with blood is one of the mechanisms by which hypertrophy occurs, so make sure you are not only going heavy in the gym, but you are getting a good pump in the gym with the exercises you are doing.  You should also download the “myfitnesspal” app on your phone. This app is the ultimate resource for newbies regarding macro counting. If you want to gain weight, you will have to eat in a caloric surplus, see my article “How to Bulk Without Getting Fat” for more info regarding how to approach a bulking up phase. Using myfitnesspal, you can track your calories and macros on a daily basis simply by plugging your meals you’re eating into your phone, and it will take care of the counting for you, and tell you how many more calories (in protein, fats, and carbs) you still need to consume to hit your daily goal. 3rd how much should I worry about what I eat if I am just trying to put on weight? Should I just be trying to eat as much as possible or are certain foods actually counterproductive? You should worry about what you eat. Clean, whole food sources are best. Avoid refined and processed foods. This means for carbs you will want things like oats, yams, potatoes, quinoa, rice, for proteins you will want things like extra extra lean ground beef, chicken, turkey, fish, fat free greek yogurt, eggs, egg whites, whey (if you need it), and for fats you will want things like walnuts, peanuts, natural peanut butter, extra virgin olive oil, almonds, etc. Avoid foods you would normally classify as junk, like pizza, fries, burgers, cookies, cake, etc as well as any food that has a high glycemic index. Raising your blood sugar will make your body store fat easier, so naturally, we want to avoid this process and get as many of our calories from sources of clean macronutrients with an extremely low glycemic index. Any good resources on getting a diet set up for someone who is lazy and picky with food like myself? Yes absolutely! My friend Chris from Goodlookingloser has already compiled an assortment of in depth lists of foods for you to refer to. These should help you pick exactly which brands of each type of food will be optimal to use to build your daily diet. Check out each of the links below for articles he has written on this subject: Best Foods For Weight Loss List of Complex Carbs That Are Best for Gaining Muscle The Best Vegetables to Eat and Why The Best Fruits to Eat and Why  Also is there a big difference in sleeping at night compared to day? Due to being in between jobs my sleep schedule is completely backwards! But I do benefits from napping whenever I want! Sleep whenever is convenient for you. Obviously ideally you would be sleeping 8 hours straight starting at a normal time at night, but if you are cumulatively getting in 8 hours of sleep per day, I highly doubt it will make a difference on your results (if at all).

    "content": "How to Bulk Without Getting Fat – Part 2     How to Bulk Without Getting Fat – Part 2 This is a continuation from the blog I recently posted on the subject. If you haven’t seen it yet, click the following link to check it out: https://moreplatesmoredates.com/bulk-without-getting-fat/ Meal Timing IS Important I don’t care what the science says, if you are allocating 100% of your carbs to your Meal 1 right when you wake up, and you train at 9pm at night and are just having protein and/or fats around your workout, you aren’t optimizing your current diet even if the overall daily macros are the same.  Allocating macros to when they are needed is one of the most overlooked aspects of a successful bulk, and it is a practice that can be used to minimize fat gains. For example, peri-workout nutrition is probably the most important times of the day where meal timing is crucial. Your body demands energy to maintain strength and muscle while you complete intense resistance training, and by strategically placing the majority of your carbs around your workout, you will be providing your body with the energy it needs, WHEN IT ACTUALLY NEEDS IT. You don’t need 100 grams carbs per meal if you aren’t even lifting that day. Think of carbs as your fuel, you don’t need excessive amounts unless your physical activity demands it, as the excess will be stored as body fat in a caloric surplus. This is where peri-workout nutrition comes into play, as you will be ideally be supplying the body with what it needs to get through a workout without half assing it, without losing strength, and with encouraging optimal recovery as well in the post-workout period where you need carbs. Putting this into practice, I encourage you (if you aren’t already doing this and your carbs are evenly spaced throughout your meals each day) to allocate 60-70% of your carb intake spread out in a pre-workout meal, an intra-workout shake (EAA’s or hydrolyzed whey and highly branched chain cyclic dextrins/HBCD's are best for the intra-workout shake – HBCD’s are ideal for fastest gastric emptying time in the intra-workout phase where instant digestion is paramount), and a post-workout meal.  I encourage you to try it out and see if your recovery is enhanced, and if you notice less fat accumulation than previous bulks. I know for me, it has significantly helped by reducing my soreness post-workout, allowing me to train harder and more often, allowing me to build more muscle, as well as keep me leaner and more insulin sensitive. Let me elaborate further.  Peri-Workout Nutrition I firmly believe if you keep your overall macros in mind, i.e. don't just add 100g carbs to intraWO but steal them from the meals farther away from your workouts you can maximize the gain potential, further minimize fat storage and stay in the ~8-9% range without a tonne of effort or cardio year round. On non-training days, carbs aren't as necessary as you won't be doing any heavy resistance work so you can allocate more of your calories (if not most) to protein and fats. Heavy intense large body part days like back or legs I encourage you to allocate a lot more of your daily calorie allotment to carbs, and on a smaller body part day like arms or shoulders, you would cut back on the fats to make room for some carbs (but not as much as a large body part day). Just think logically, if I am doing nothing all day, do I need a bunch of carbs? Or, if I am going to do a balls to the wall leg workout that takes an hour and a half, do I think I might need more carbs than I do on a rest day? When your body demands energy, provide it, when it doesn't, avoid it to minimize fat storage.  For the intra-workout shake, EAAs are cheaper than proper hydrolized whey (really only hydrolyzed caseinate, or better yet peptopro are appropriate)…isolate almost defeats the purpose of expensive HBCDs because it takes too much time and effort for your body to digest. Combining the HBCDs with a complete protein (either predigested in the form of hydrolized/peptopro or straight EAAs) allows your body to immediately start tackling muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to combat the muscle protein breakdown (MPB) caused by your hypertrophic training…minimizing the MPB trough and maximizing the overall MPS : MPB ratio…end result is “more” results (less to no soreness and more to WAY MORE growth) HBCDs have such low osmalarity that they don't even need to hit the intestine, they're simply absorbed straight through the stomach lining…so in terms of absorption and complete lack of need for gastric emptying (and the interim bloating until that happens) it's absolutely great. Additionally, they have a much lower insulin spike effect, providing a much steadier energy curve / release throughout your workout even if you don't time your ‘sips' particularly well…no 2-3 shake combination bullshit required. This ties especially well into insulin use around your workout, which will be covered in another blog post in the future. For the pre-workout meal and post-workout meal I suggest whole food meals with a good supply of carbs and protein (depending on which body part you are training will depend on how many carbs you will allow yourself based on your daily caloric allotment). Avoid refined foods and sugars. What Macros Should I Be Eating There are countless “splits” out there (like the classic 40/40/20 protein carb fat split) where 40% of your calories come from protein, 40% carbs, 20% fats, and that outlines your diet approach. There are keto diets, intermittent fasting diets, high carb, low carb, etc. There are a million and one ways to approach your bulk, but the truth is guys, you need to experiment to find what your body best grows from.  I don’t care if some “guru/expert” has told you that you need 1.5 grams protein per pound of body weight to grow optimally, I know some guys who grow like weeds off of 1 gram per pound and the rest of their calories are all carbs, whereas some guys I know push 400-500 grams protein per day with super low carbs and that approach makes them grow more. To grow optimally, you will need to take several different approaches to your bulk periods and see what truly keeps your body fat the lowest, and allows you to grow the most at the same time. I could tell you my “split”, or splits from other national level competitors I am friends with, but to be honest, it wouldn’t really help you. Sure it would give you some guidance and you may take comfort in the fact when you follow the same split as a guy with a physique you admire, but you need to find a split that works for your body, and allows you to properly digest your food and function at 100% in the gym. If some guy is having quinoa every single meal and he is jacked out of his tree, it DOES NOT mean that quinoa is the magic carb that will make you grow like crazy too. You may very well get a better pump off of jasmine rice or feel less bogged down with some cream of wheat, the possibilities are endless, and a huge battle in this game is finding foods your body agrees with the best. I find I get really bloated and bogged down by excessive oatmeal consumption for my carbs, but I digest jasmine rice like a breeze and feel awesome after eating them. So logically, a lot of my carb intake comes from jasmine rice right now, and it works for me. Eat Clean Food Sources This may sound contrary to what I just said regarding eating what your body responds best to, but there should still be a general pattern of rhyme and reason to your eating habits. Obviously to stay lean, you need to eat clean. You are what you eat is the saying, and if all your calories are coming from sugar dense ice cream or something for your carbs, you need to take a step back and rethink your diet. Obviously there are various clean carb sources available, a few that come to mind are oats, rice, yams, quinoa, etc. I urge you to keep your diet clean, as in a caloric surplus your glycogen stores are already going to be very replenished the majority of the time, and you can be very prone to over-spilling and gaining fat from unnecessary garbage foods. I’m not saying don’t indulge once and a while, but be smart about it, and ideally steal the calories from other meals in the day to make room for that cheat meal you treat yourself to once or twice a week. Do Cardio!!!! I used to think cardio was counterproductive during a bulk phase, so I never did it. I knew it was good for heart health, but at the time I didn’t give a shit about that because I was just some misguided knob who just cared about being huge. Not only should you still include cardio into your regimen a few times per week in a bulk phase for heart health, but it will IMPROVE your metabolism, allowing you to not only stay leaner, but it will improve your appetite.  I get ravenous after a good cardio session, and with appetite being one of my main issues in the off-season, it is a very good tool to keep in your program to make progress. Take Measures To Keep Your Appetite Up I don’t have a high capacity for tons of clean food, and a lot of the time during bulk phases I find myself force feeding food just to get my 3500 calories in (or whatever my daily goal is at the time). Sure eating 3500 calories+ of shitty fat and sugar dense food isn’t hard, but it can get very tough if your diet is comprised of healthy choices like extra extra lean ground beef, chicken, rice, oats, etc. I already mentioned cardio as a good method to stroke your appetite, but another method is meal portioning. Separating your meals into several smaller meals not only allows your body to process the food a lot better, but you will become satiated less easily, and be ready to eat again a few hours later.  If worst comes to worst and your appetite is really preventing you from getting the amount of food you need in, you can look into the peptide GHRP-6. GHRP-6 is fantastic for those who have extreme appetite issues, and it can be a game changer for those who can’t stomach the amount of clean food they need to grow. It literally can take a person from totally not hungry, to ravenous within 15 minutes. Absolutely great tool. What Supplements Should I Be Using In a Bulk This is entirely dependent on your goals and your physical requirements, but supplement wise I suggest getting a fast digesting carbohydrate that doesn’t bloat you for intra-workout, as well as a high quality hydro-whey or EAA product. In addition, creatine monohydrate is extremely cheap and 5 grams of it a day (timing is irrelevant just make sure you take it every day) is something I’d recommend as well. Also, a decent protein isolate is great for when you are on the go and don’t have time to pack a whole food meal (I always recommend whole foods over shakes if possible). And finally, if and only if you absolutely need it, a weight gainer wouldn’t hurt to have on hand. Sometimes getting in your calories is extremely difficult if you are on severe time constraints, and having a weight gainer product on hand that isn’t amino spiked and doesn’t have a high sugar content can be an acceptable meal replacement when absolutely necessary.  If the sugar content is extremely dense per shake, stay far away. I usually will just make my own weight gainer shake with whey isolate, blended up oats, and some natural peanut butter or extra virgin olive oil though and it serves the same purpose but offers a much better nutrient profile than a store bought gainer.    Related              Facebook            Twitter            LinkedIn                                     Get My \"20 Underground Bodybuilding Secrets You Won't Find On Google\" E-Book 100% FREE          Also Get Updated Every Time I Publish New Content And Receive FREE Exclusive Offers             Email       SUBSCRIBE (FREE)          We won't share your information with anyone.

    "content": "How to Bulk Without Getting Fat     How to Bulk Without Getting Fat For decades bodybuilding enthusiasts have wanted the answer to one overarching question. How can you build muscle and lose fat at the same time? In short, this process is unfortunately unachievable for the vast majority of us. Exceptions may include those who are brand new to resistance training, and those who utilize performance enhancing drugs. Even these individuals will most likely end up spinning their wheels though if their goal is to accomplish both tasks simultaneously. However, if you take a smart approach to your off-season, it is very possible to severely limit how much fat you will put on your physique, while still packing on lean tissue. This approach is what you should strive for, not only for maintaining a look that is presentable to the public (aka your face isn’t a bloated double chin disaster), but maintaining higher insulin sensitivity by limiting your body fat levels will actually promote more lean tissue growth.  The general keys to a healthy off-season are a slight (and when I mean slight I stress the word slight) caloric surplus, consistency in your program (for at least a few months in my opinion), and using the mirror as your guide when addressing potential changes that you may need to make to your regimen. Obviously within those keys, there are several tiers of knowledge that must be used to encourage muscle growth such as what food sources to get your calories from, how you should train, how often you should be resting, how your training should differ during a bulk phase as opposed to a phase dedicated to a cutting phase, how much cardio you should be doing while bulking, etc. But if I covered all of those subtopics this article would easily become an essay, so this will be a Part 1 of a series I will be doing on the subject as a whole. Most bulking guides out there will tell you to find your total daily energy expenditure (total calories burned per day) and then add 500 calories to that and start there. Hell, some guides and “knowledgeable” individuals will tell you to throw 1000 calories on it and start from there. I’m telling you right now, if you aren’t a 225 pound+ bodybuilder, it is very unlikely you actually need more than 4000 calories to grow, yet you see 150 pound kids walking around saying they’re pounding 8000 calories per day and not growing.  These individuals who make these staggering claims are either straight up not counting their actual caloric intake and are bullshitting, or are a genetic phenom with an absurd level of hunger and dedicate way too much of their time each day eating. When I first started trying to gain weight I was a 140 pound “hard gainer”. I threw the kitchen sink at my body food wise off the bat, pounding weight gainer shakes and copious amounts of food thinking the more the better and easily pushed 4500-5000 calories daily. While I did gain muscle, I gained so much unnecessary fat. I recommend starting with a 200-300 calorie surplus at most, and reassessing after a week or so Now, with a 210 pound physique and around 7% body fat almost 6 years later, if I want to push the scale up and start gaining I will usually start my bulk phase at around 3200 calories, and that is sufficient for me to start making gains. Once I plateau, I will add another 100 calories of carbs around my workout when my body demands the extra energy, and continue accordingly, while using the mirror as my guide for if I need to adjust something. Your body uses calories as a source of energy, if you are taking in more than your daily expenditure of calories, you will store the excess as fat. Using a very slight caloric surplus reduces the excess calories that your body isn’t actually putting to use to recover and rebuild muscle tissue from your resistance training, consequently limiting your overall fat gains. In addition, if you go off the bat with a huge caloric surplus, the only direction you can go with your calories is up if you want to continue to gain weight. Your body will eventually plateau on the level of calories you are taking in, and you may soon find yourself trying to push 4500-5000 calories of clean food into yourself everyday just to make the scale go up. I don’t know about you, but I don’t have the greatest appetite and getting in even 3500 calories of totally clean food can be a huge struggle. Getting into the 4500 calorie+ zone is where a lot of guys are forced to start incorporating junk food into their diets daily to get the calories in they need to keep the scale going up, and ideally, you don’t want to be throwing garbage into your digestive system on a daily basis. Use the mirror as your guide If you are gaining weight, but you are looking much worse, why would you continue to eat the way you are eating? Some people are so concerned with the scale weight that they get incredibly biased towards their own physique and just assume they are gaining lean tissue if the scale is going up. I can’t stress this enough, USE THE MIRROR AS YOUR GUIDE. If you are getting fat, you need to take a step back and look at your diet, your training, your rest, and see what could be adjusted or changed to address the issue. “Not fat, just bulking!” The amount of fat you gain should never eclipse the amount of muscle you are gaining as the scale goes up, and when that starts to happen, you are probably overeating, or your insulin sensitivity has taken a dive and it’s time to do a mini-diet to reset your sensitivity. That is a whole different topic that I will cover soon though, as insulin sensitivity is probably one of the most unaddressed concepts in bodybuilding and is a common issue in wrecking your body composition. If your insulin sensitivity has taken a total dive from abuse of carbohydrates in your off-season diet, injecting too much GH too often, or a myriad of other causes, then you absolutely MUST take action to improve your sensitivity to continue your off-season in a productive manner. Guys with low insulin sensitivity will pack on fat easily and have a much harder time putting on muscle, not to mention the health implications that could result from it *cough* Type II Diabetes *cough* I digress though and encourage you to not only keep an eye on the mirror, but your abs as well. They should never totally disappear in the off-season, and if you literally can’t see them at all anymore, it is a good indicator you have let yourself gain too much fat and you need to cut back down. I sure as hell don’t bust my ass in the gym and eat the way I do to walk around not looking like I’m in shape 365 days per year. End of a Bulk a few years ago The image I added above from the end of one of my bulk phases is a good example of being very close to the fattest I would let myself get before I would know it's time to diet down again. Abs are still in, although really blurred and soft from the excess fat (and shitty picture quality). I don't let things get out of control even during a bulk phase with a direct focus on adding size and making the scale go up (favorably of course). The vast majority of individuals use their off-season (a duration of time dedicated to putting on new muscle) as an excuse to consume exorbitant amounts of calories, thinking that it will simply equate to more muscle gained, and they will worry about stripping the fat off at a later date. I am guilty of this in my past, and I’m not going to say this method doesn’t work, but it certainly isn’t optimal and it is extremely unhealthy. I remember when I bulked up to 250 pounds a few years back and my blood pressure got up to 150/100 at one point, and I was getting winded just walking up my staircase at home, not to mention my sleep apnea got sooooooo much worse it was ridiculous. When you walk around at a very high weight, your heart and lungs need to work that much harder to provide oxygen throughout your body to support all the extra weight you are walking around with. I think I had a resting heart rate of almost 100 it was terrible. In short, don’t do this. Consistency Is Key Sticking to a strict diet and training regimen can be tough for some, but the real results shine when you are consistent. Anybody can have a perfect day and feel good that they followed their diet and training and cardio regiment to a tee, but the real physique changes come to those who can have that perfect day, every day, for a long duration of time. I get a lot of guys on the goodlookingloser forums asking me about short mini-bulk phases, and the truth is, those don’t work. Sure you can do a short intense cut and lose a lot of fat, but if your goal is to build an appreciable amount of NEW muscle, you need to set aside a large portion of time (many months) dedicated to slowly packing on new size, while keeping your body fat levels as low as possible. Your body simply can’t build any appreciable mass of good composition (mass majorly comprised of muscle tissue) in a 4 week bulk or something along those lines. All the weight you pack on will most likely just be stored glycogen filling you out after a cut phase, water weight, increased blood volume, large amounts of food in your stomach from the big meals, with a bit of muscle in there and some fat. In short, the weight probably isn’t comprised of majorly the good weight we want. If I wanted to gain 5 pounds of MUSCLE for example, I would probably set aside at least 4-6 months to a very focused bulk/off-season. If you’re a newbie or haven’t really committed yourself to a strict program ever, you will be able to make a lot more progress quicker than someone like me who has been lifting for 6 years, but it still isn’t an overnight thing at all. By no means am I saying if you gain even a little bit of noticeable fat then your bulk is completely shot and you need to start cutting back down, you will inevitably gain a bit of body fat as you gain muscle. I don’t think anybody should be out of striking distance range of 10% body fat even at their fattest point in the off-season though, and if you let your body fat creep up above 15%, or upwards of 20%, you are simply shooting yourself in the foot embarking on a bulk phase at that point. Get down to single digit body fat levels, and then slowly bulk up until you notice you are getting to the 14-15%+ range, and then cut back down. Rinse and repeat.
