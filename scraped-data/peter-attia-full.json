      "title": "#378 ‒ Women’s health and performance: how training, nutrition, and hormones interact across life stages | Abbie Smith-Ryan, Ph.D.",
      "content": "Abbie Smith-Ryan is a leading researcher in exercise physiology whose work focuses on how training and nutrition influence body composition, metabolism, cardiovascular health, and women’s health across the lifespan, with particular attention on perimenopause and post-menopause. In this episode, Abbie explains how early exercise and play help build the foundation for bone health, muscle development, and cardiorespiratory fitness in girls, as well as how puberty and menstruation shape athletic performance, motivation, and recovery. She also explores how women can tailor training and nutrition across the menstrual cycle through smart fueling, hydration, and inflammation management; examines the evidence behind supplements such as creatine, omega-3s, and magnesium; and unpacks the metabolic and body composition changes that accompany the transition into perimenopause and menopause. Finally, she covers practical exercise programming for busy women, training and nutrition considerations during pregnancy and postpartum, and the evolving role of hormone therapy alongside lifestyle-based, evidence-driven approaches that help women better advocate for their health.

Show Notes Abbie’s background in distance running and her interest in studying women’s health around exercise [A: 3:00, V: 0:11] Tell me a little bit about your background in terms of what got you interested in this space Abbie was a collegiate distance runner, but she has always had a love of strength training, which is a little bit impeding for endurance goals She really fell in love with science, the ability to ask a question and answer it She started early with research and then fumbled her way in that space, really understanding: the more you know, the more you don’t know As Peter’s friend Bob Kaplan used to say, “The further you get from shore, the deeper the water gets.” You’re a distance runner. In college, that’s what, 5K, 10K? 3K, 5K, 1,500, 800 (if her coach was mad), she adds, “I’m not that fast.” Peter’s daughter runs track and he feels like the 800 is the worst, most painful even in the lot Abbie would add the 1500: you have to do 2 more laps at a similar pace There is something about that approximate 2 minute all-out effort that is really brutal The role of early-life exercise in building lifelong bone, muscle, and cardiovascular health in girls [A: 4:00, V: 1:23] Peter points out, “There are certain things that just seem obvious and true across the board.” We know that exercise is a remarkable tool to delay the onset of chronic disease We also know that it’s a remarkable tool to improve health span or quality of life Peter wants to focus on Abbie’s expertise around what we can understand in terms of exercise across the life cycle of a woman And he wants to start at the beginning He’s pretty sure there are no teenage girls listening to this podcast, but there are probably parents of those A previous guest made a point that Peter thought was amazing, and it has never left him: osteoporosis is a childhood disease [episode #322 with Belinda Beck] What she meant was that women are reaching their genetic ceiling at about the age of 19 (in terms of bone density) Then from 19 until the end of life, they’re hanging on to what they’ve got And then they’ve got all of these things that get in the way, such as menopause If you’re a 10-year-old girl, how do you think about the role of exercise across several dimensions, not the least of which being bone health but muscle health and reaching their cardiorespiratory potential? That’s a big question Abbie would sum it up: exercise is the best medicine Starting young, consider it more play and then transitioning into lots of different types of exercise There’s lots of literature to suggest this “The earlier you start and the better base that you have, the easier it is over time to maintain that fitness.”‒ Abbie Smith-Ryan When we think about young girls, the biggest conversation and even some of the research we do: menstruation often is a turning point when women and girls leave sport Based on a number of things, of how their body changes, how their performance differs Abbie shares part of what her lab looks at, “Understanding how that menstrual cycle might impact performance, recovery, bloating, mental health.” Abbie is here in part to have that conversation When she was growing up, no one talked about it Were you a runner growing up as well? Yeah, she played all sports She loved every sport you can imagine She grew up in a space where it was exercise more and eat less When you add running, it’s this ability to really see how your fitness changes The same with resistance training: you can see how strong you get It’s a very empowering tool Abbie makes the point, “We don’t talk about it enough with young girls: What is menstruation? Why is it healthy?” Training principles for premenstrual girls, the risks of early specialization and delayed puberty from intense training, and how youth sport participation can shape bone and spinal health [A: 7:15, V: 5:00] Let’s talk first about the pre-menstrual cycle Are there any dos and don’ts that you think of for young girls who are playing sports in terms of what they can be doing to augment their training? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Oldies-But-Goodies: January 2026 Edition",
      "content": "This week, we’re sharing another collection of oldies-but-goodies—pieces from our newsletter archive that address a variety of topics of continued interest to our audience. Some provide additional context for recent or upcoming content; some address frequently asked questions; and some are simply worth repeating for anyone who might have missed them. In honor of the new year, we’re focusing this collection on two common target areas for new year’s resolutions: nutrition and exercise. The world of biomedical science is constantly evolving, but in evaluating what has changed, we like to pause now and then to acknowledge information and ideas that have remained relevant despite the passage of time—a celebration of “aging well,” if you will. Back on the merry-go-round of bad science regarding meat consumption Adopting a new diet is a popular new year’s resolution for those seeking to improve their health, but given the amount of conflicting and misleading nutrition advice to which we’re constantly exposed, it’s often difficult to tell what changes might truly support a longer, healthier life. Indeed, a common resolution is to cut down on meat consumption or stop altogether, a decision often based on the perception of meat as an agent of disease and mortality. Yet meat’s negative reputation is hardly justified. It stems from a long history of observational research such as the study discussed in this 2024 newsletter on meat intake and diabetes risk—in which cherry-picked data and biased study groups were mistaken for causal associations.1 Dietary changes can be an impactful tool for improving health, but we need to be cautious that the changes we’re making are based on rigorous science, not overhyped and misinterpreted correlations. For guidance on choosing a diet that works for you and your health needs, we recently released an AMA in which we provide a framework for evaluating various nutritional approaches and use it to discuss potential advantages and disadvantages in a handful of popular diets. Resistance training partially reverses some of the hallmarks of aging type II muscle fibers Muscle strength is a topic we return to often in our content, as it is critical for maintaining health and physical function. (This past spring, we released an AMA designed to organize and streamline much of our back-content on strength and strategies for building and maintaining muscle mass.) But muscle mass and muscle quality tend to decline with age, resulting in a parallel decline in functional capacities, increased risk of falls and injuries, and reduced metabolic health. However, age-related changes in muscle are not as unavoidable as we might have previously imagined. We know that resistance training can help to preserve muscle mass, but as discussed in this piece two years ago, research has shown that it also appears to slow or even reverse progressive deformation of muscle fibers—signifying that resistance exercise can also preserve muscle quality.2 Thus, although morning jogs or biking to work tend to get most of the attention when it comes to exercise resolutions, this newsletter reminds us not to neglect strength training as a vital component of any effort toward building a longer and healthier life.

Such was the case in March 2023 following publication of a paper seeming to show that the low-calorie sweetener erythritol raised risk of cardiovascular disease.3 In our subsequent commentary on this research, we pointed out why the results were misleading, and the critique serves as a timeless reminder to view flashy nutrition headlines with a healthy dose of skepticism. Still, while we may not need to worry about erythritol and cardiovascular disease, sugar substitutes as a broad class occupy a controversial space in health and nutrition. To those interested in understanding various types of sweeteners and how the contexts in which they’re used can impact effects on health, we encourage you to check out our AMA episode on sugar and sugar substitutes from this past summer. The [almost] unbelievable effects of a high maximal aerobic capacity on all-cause mortality Given the positive feedback we received in response to last year’s AMA on strength and muscle mass, we recently took a similar approach with another key facet of exercise—cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), which is a function of both aerobic base/endurance and maximal aerobic capacity. We distilled dozens of hours of information on understanding, assessing, and training CRF into clear, organized takeaways and guidance, and the resulting CRF AMA is scheduled for release next week. However, in prioritizing actionable insights, we were left with limited time to dive deep into why CRF is so important from a longevity and healthspan perspective. Thus, we are re-sharing this premium article from April 2024 to help fill some of the gaps. The piece focuses on the maximal aerobic capacity side of the CRF formula, detailing why it is the most powerful predictor of health and lifespan that we have at our disposal. It serves as a handy primer for the upcoming AMA, especially for those who might be newer to our content. (For those interested in learning more about the aerobic base side of CRF, check out our follow-up premium piece on Zone 2.) Don’t drink and science: why a study on the cognitive effects of wine and cheese is sheer stupidity The limitations of epidemiology—and in particular, nutritional epidemiology—have been recurring themes across our content. Research in this field typically employs study designs that leave ample room for bias and confounding, and strictly correlational results are often inappropriately interpreted as evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. Every week brings a new load of flawed epidemiology studies from which we can draw no useful information, and we usually only bother to address them at all if they’ve captured media attention or we receive direct questions from our audience (such as with the other nutrition newsletters we’ve shared in this “oldies-but-goodies” edition). But two years ago, we came across a study that exemplified such a broad range of missteps in scientific research and logic that it served as a perfect opportunity to show readers many of the flaws to watch out for when encountering headlines and articles about nutritional epidemiology.4 In fact, the study was so awful on so many accounts that it became almost comical, and indeed, across our entire catalog of weekly newsletters, few have been more fun to write than this critique. We hope that it gives you a laugh, but more importantly, we share it again now to help empower you to discern for yourself what is valuable in nutrition research and what is merely hype or click-bait. The new year will undoubtedly bring more scientific misinformation across a range of subjects, but the flaws are often remarkably consistent. Practice spotting them, and you can begin cutting through the noise and focusing more on the information that matters.

      "title": "Using “atomic habits” to reach your health goals",
      "content": "In 2021, I interviewed James Clear on The Drive to talk about his book “Atomic Habits,” and the podcast was so popular that we have re-released it around New Year’s Day every year since. Last year, we took the extra step of publishing a special newsletter in which we summarized some of James’s insights and illustrated them using specific examples from recent podcast episodes. The piece served as a companion to last year’s re-release of the podcast interview, and we’ve decided to repeat the pairing again this year—with a few updated examples from this past year’s podcasts—to keep the information fresh and demonstrate just how widely these principles apply when it comes to health and wellness.

As James explained on the podcast, a large amount of our behavior (40–50%) is automatic and habitual, and we are building habits all the time whether we are consciously aware of it or not. Forming good habits is an essential part of both my clinical practice and my approach to my own health and life. While our ultimate goal is to change behaviors, we have to start with forming habits. A series of small and easy changes can collectively make a very big difference. The key to James’s advice is to follow four “laws” to incorporate an action into your routine so that it becomes a habit: 1) Make it obvious; 2) Make it attractive; 3) Make it easy; and 4) Make it satisfying. <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final_Approved_Good_Habits_Table-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36262\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final_Approved_Good_Habits_Table-2.webp 900w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final_Approved_Good_Habits_Table-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final_Approved_Good_Habits_Table-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final_Approved_Good_Habits_Table-2-400x267.webp 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" />Figure 1. Four Laws of Behavior Change for Developing Good Habits. Credit: radreads.co In this newsletter, we’re going to go through each of these elements and apply them to some of the actionable health advice we received from guests on The Drive over the past year. 1. Make it obvious Cues promoting a good habit should be easy to spot and grab one’s attention. For example, if you want to run each morning, put your running shoes by the door as a visual reminder. Of course, this step requires you to first identify such potential cues. Ask yourself what visual reminders would help you and where in your home, office, car, or anywhere else they should be. Drs. Tanuj Nakra and Suzan Obagi promoted this strategy on the podcast this year in our discussion on skincare and facial aging. During our interview, these specialists brought up a number of ways to protect the face from the signs of aging, such as regularly applying mineral sunscreen or using a nightly retinoid treatment. Though these strategies require relatively low effort, each still constitutes one more chore to remember and stick to, so Suzan suggested adding a visual cue until it becomes routine: “Right next to your toothbrush, put your little tube of retinoid.” For most of us, brushing our teeth is a nightly ritual, so by placing skincare products near the toothbrush, we have a visual reminder to incorporate the latter into our pre-bedtime routine. 2. Make it attractive We all intuitively know that making something appealing or exciting will increase our motivation to do it. Your social environment is very important in determining how attractive something is, especially in the long term. If your goal is to stop drinking, going to bars with your martini-loving friends is going to make you miserable and undermine your goal. Having an alcohol-free game night at your house, though, can help you to break the association between drinking and fun and offers the added bonus of the anticipation of having friends over. (Indeed, one of the most effective ways of making a new habit attractive is to involve friends who are interested in making similar changes in their own lives.) The physical environment is important in developing habits, too. If your goal is to eat more vegetables, make sure your pantry isn’t full of tempting junk food and that your fridge is stocked with your favorite vegetable-based snacks. Making tasks more attractive is also a great way to motivate kids toward beneficial habits. Joe Liemandt, a former software engineer who now devotes his attention to reimagining K–12 education, co-founded the Alpha School in part based on this principle. As he explained on the podcast, incorporating evidence-based, AI-driven apps as educational tools fosters greater excitement than traditional lecture-based classes and motivates students to become more actively engaged in learning. In other words, making education more fun builds the habit of active learning. Dr. Kyler Brown also utilizes the “make it attractive” strategy in sports rehabilitation and for untrained individuals by taking into account not only the needs of his clients, but their preferences as well. “If I just try to convince you to do an exercise you hate doing, it’s not going to last,” he says. For instance, if you need to improve your cardiorespiratory fitness but can’t stand running, simply switching the training modality to cycling or swimming can make cardio sessions more attractive without diminishing their impact. 3. Make it easy Convenience and simplicity make it more likely that you will perform a behavior regularly. James gave an example of a man who went to the gym for six weeks but only stayed for five minutes; he made going to the gym much easier by focusing first on the habit of getting there, without concerning himself with the more intimidating task of working out for an hour. The “two-minute rule” can also be useful when you are getting started: condense the habit you want to start into something that takes two minutes or fewer to do. This feels much more manageable and allows you to gradually build up as each step feels easier to do. As Dr. Rhonda Patrick discussed in her most recent appearance on The Drive, most individuals could benefit from eating more protein—which is necessary for building and maintaining muscle—and optimal intake is likely at least 1.6 g/kg body weight/day (double the current Recommended Dietary Allowance) for typical adults. But getting this quantity of protein each day often requires dedicated effort, especially if we’re trying to do so without significantly increasing intake of saturated fats and total calories. So how do we “make it easy,” or at least easier? A simple strategy is to replace some of our usual snacks with high-protein options—jerky or nut mixes instead of chips or crackers, protein bars instead of cereal bars, etc—and keep these protein snacks in easily accessible areas of the kitchen or at your desk at work. Stock the fridge with turkey cold cuts or keep canned fish in the pantry to make sure you have easy protein options to add to salads or sandwiches on busy weeknights. 4. Make it satisfying Tracking your progress and seeing the improvements that come with your new habit will provide a strong motivation to keep progressing towards your goal. Last year, I mentioned that I’d recently purchased a portable VO2 device and was using it to track this metric for myself, which added to my enjoyment of exercising. Likewise, seeing your resting heart rate decrease or muscle mass increase over time can be very satisfying readouts that your efforts in the gym are working. But satisfaction doesn’t always need to come from quantitative metrics or even from gradual improvements over long time frames—for some habits, the satisfaction can be more direct. In my recent discussion with Dr. Sally Greenwald, a gynecologist and expert in women’s sexual health, she proposed that women should incorporate vaginal care into their everyday routine by applying lubricant and vaginal moisturizers on a daily basis—analogous to how they might apply sunscreen or facial moisturizers to care for their skin. As Sally explained, these practices can help to ensure long-term health of the vagina but also have the more immediate reward of reducing pain and enhancing pleasure during intercourse. In other words, building this particular habit can lead fairly directly to greater sexual satisfaction. Obviously, many (if not most) of the habits we hope to build may not have this sort of rapid reinforcement, but even in those cases, we can often help ourselves by creating short-term rewards to pair with our desired behaviors. Imagine buying yourself a new outfit after a month of successful weight training or splurging on a new sound system after redesigning your environment to support healthy eating and keeping it that way for six weeks. However, we must be careful to ensure the rewards are consistent with the overall goals: don’t buy yourself ice cream as a reward for losing weight or a more comfortable couch for becoming physically active. Breaking Bad Habits Just as it’s important to develop good habits, it’s often necessary to break bad ones. Unsurprisingly, the steps for breaking a bad habit are the reverse of the four laws for developing good ones. <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final_Consistent_Line_Above_Law1_Bad_Habits_Table-2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36261\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final_Consistent_Line_Above_Law1_Bad_Habits_Table-2.webp 950w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final_Consistent_Line_Above_Law1_Bad_Habits_Table-2-300x189.webp 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final_Consistent_Line_Above_Law1_Bad_Habits_Table-2-768x485.webp 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final_Consistent_Line_Above_Law1_Bad_Habits_Table-2-400x253.webp 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" />Figure 2. Four Laws of Behavior Change for Breaking Bad Habits. Credit: radreads.co In my conversation with sleep expert Dr. Ashley Mason, she emphasized the critical importance of associating bed and the bedroom space almost exclusively with sleep—rather than with scrolling through social media, checking emails, or watching television, for instance. But for many, reaching for our digital devices even as we crawl into bed has become a habit that is difficult to break—providing us with an excellent example of how to employ James Clear’s “anti-rules” to move away from this undesirable pattern of behavior. Perhaps the easiest steps to take in this case are “making it invisible” and “making it difficult.” For instance, you might remove your devices from sight an hour or two before bed by stowing them in a desk or nightstand drawer, and keep your phone out of arm’s reach of your bed such that you’d need to get up and walk across the room in order to check it. Another strategy might be to shut down your phone or tablet entirely before bed such that you’d need to put forth the time and effort to reboot it again for use (some devices allow you to schedule automatic on/off times). “Making it unattractive” is also relatively simple—delete games and social media apps such that you have fewer tempting options for deriving entertainment and endless dopamine hits through your device. Finally, to “make it unsatisfying,” we might try setting up alerts on the device to chastise us when we use it during predetermined “quiet hours,” or we might take note of dips in sleep quality metrics on nights when we fall asleep just after watching a horror film or spending an hour on stressful work emails. The bottom line Setting up good health habits now can enhance your healthspan and likely your lifespan, too. The “laws” we learned from James Clear can help us apply the lessons we learned from the other podcast guests. In our podcasts, we aim to provide you with actionable steps to put the science of longevity into practice. As we enter a new year, think about the health goals you’d like to reach and the “atomic habits” that will help you get there. Happy New Year!

Show Notes Happiness vs. happy feelings, and how happiness and unhappiness can coexist [A: 2:15, V: 1:20] Peter congratulates Arthur on his new book and adds, “This is not your first, second or third rodeo, but I’m sure each time, it’s a little bit of a what’s the world going to think?” Arthur thinks writing a book is like having a child, “A book is something where as you bring it into the world you go through…” [stages] He remembers Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the Swiss psychiatrist who wrote that famous book about death and dying You have to go through five stages Most of that research has been questioned since then, but it’s pretty interesting When writing a book, you go through bargaining and denial and rage, and finally there’s acceptance but you’re still nervous for sure What’s the difference between happiness and happy feelings? Are they the same thing? They’re not the same thing, and this is a really important misconception Most of us live in the era of feelings Arthur adds, “If you’d talk to my parents or, god knows, my grandparents about feelings, they would scratch their head. What are you talking about?” You’re talking about your emotions all the time, ephemera Feelings seems so counterproductive “Our grandparents were right. Feelings are not happiness, any more than the smell of the turkey is your Thanksgiving dinner.”‒ Arthur Brooks Feelings are evidence of happiness, and that’s incredibly good news A lot of people think that happiness is a feeling. It’s quite incorrect. There are many better technical definitions of happiness, but they produce a lot of feelings They’re associated with a lot of emotions, which is limbic system activity (a part of the brain) A 40-million year evolutionary process that developed the limbic system to create emotions That signals information and is what emotions come from If you mistake these feelings for the underlying phenomenon of happiness, you’re going to be chasing it all over the place You’ll be chasing ghosts: how I slept last night, what I ate for breakfast, if my spouse yelled at me this morning If you mistake the feelings of happiness for the underlying phenomenon of happiness, you wind up being managed as opposed to having any prayer of managing your own happiness That’s the first thing to keep in mind: it’s not feelings Peter reflects, “It’s hard to differentiate though… you have to remind yourself when you’re in the throes of what I just referred to as negatively valenced feelings, that this is not a statement of my overall state of happiness.” What’s the relationship between unhappiness and happiness? Are they polar images? How do they coexist? If you go back to the ancient philosophers, there was the idea that happiness and unhappiness exists on a spectrum So unhappiness would be the lack of happiness We know a lot better now given the explosion of neuroscience and the way that emotions are produced that in fact, you can be happy and unhappy Or have happy and unhappy feelings in parallel For example, the average person spends about 40% of their time with predominantly positive feelings It sits in a neutral idle of positivity Most people do, not everybody About 16 or 17% of the time, the average person has predominantly negative feelings, something is going on That’s more intense And part of the reason is because negative emotions get your attention and they’re supposed to Evolution favors negative emotions Positive emotions are nice to have, but negative emotions, pay attention because that could cost you your life The six fundamental emotions [A: 5:30, V: 4:43] What are some of the most powerful negative emotions that would drive action? If you think about his evolutionarily, and not even going back to millions of years ago but just going back hundreds of thousands of years ago to the origin of our species as homo sapiens There are basically 6 fundamental emotions or basic emotions These are the building blocks of all emotional life that are produced by the limbic system of the brain 4 negative and 2 positive The 4 negative emotions are sadness, anger, fear and disgust All 4 of those have a very strong evolutionary basis Fear and anger have to do with threat {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

Brooks is the William Henry Bloomberg Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School and Professor of Management Practice at Harvard Business School. Before joining the Harvard faculty in July of 2019, he served for ten years as president of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a public policy think tank in Washington, DC. Brooks is the author of 12 books, including the national bestsellers: Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier (2023), From Strength to Strength (2022), Love Your Enemies (2019), The Conservative Heart (2015), and The Road to Freedom (2012). He is a columnist for The Atlantic, host of the podcast How to Build a Happy Life, and subject of the 2019 documentary film The Pursuit. He serves on the board of the Legatum Institute, a think tank in London. Brooks began his career as a classical French hornist, leaving college at 19, touring and recording with the Annapolis Brass Quintet and later, the City Orchestra of Barcelona. In his late twenties, while still performing, he returned to school, earning a BA through distance learning at Thomas Edison State College, and then an MA in economics from Florida Atlantic University. At 31, he left music and earned an MPhil and PhD in public policy analysis from the Rand Graduate School, during which time he worked as an analyst for the Rand Corporation’s Project Air Force. Brooks then spent 10 years as a university professor, becoming a full professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs in his seventh year out of graduate school and occupying the Louis A. Bantle Chair in Business and Government. During this decade, Brooks published 60 peer-reviewed articles and several books, including the textbook Social Entrepreneurship (2008).

      "title": "There’s no age limit to living a full and happy life",
      "content": "Throughout our practice and content, we follow a guiding principle that the goal of living longer must go hand-in-hand with the goal of living well throughout those extra years. Indeed, the latter goal is arguably the more important of the two—even if striving to maintain our physical, mental, and socio-emotional health doesn’t add a single nanosecond to our lifespan, the efforts will have been worth it if they allow us to approach our later years with vigor, purpose, and joy. Last year around the holidays, we sought to emphasize this message and provide inspiration by sharing stories of ordinary people living extraordinarily full lives well into their 80s, 90s, and beyond. The piece seemed to resonate with readers, some of whom responded with stories of other individuals who exemplify the goal of living well in your “marginal decade.” Thus, we’ve decided to return to these spotlights again this year with a new set of exceptional elderly—proving that enjoyment of life has no age limit. The neuroscientist At age 107, Dr. Brenda Milner remains an active researcher and professor in neuroscience and psychology at McGill University and the Montreal Neurological Institute, but her longevity and ongoing dedication to her work aren’t the only qualities that make her exceptional. Born into a British musical family in 1918, Brenda pursued an education in the relatively new field of psychology—at a time when female scientists were few and far between. After applying her scientific training toward the Allied war effort during World War II, Brenda moved with her husband to Montreal, where she completed her PhD (another rarity for women at the time) and went on to conduct groundbreaking research on the neural circuits and brain structures involved in memory and language.1 Her work has earned her numerous accolades, and she’s widely regarded as one of the most influential and significant neuroscientists of the twentieth century—but she isn’t done quite yet. While various scholarships and research awards named in her honor will ensure her continued support for young neuropsychologists for years to come, Dr. Milner prefers to have a more direct impact for as long as she can, and she continues to be involved in research and training as an emerita professor. Our research team spends hundreds of hours each month vetting studies and distilling dense literature to deliver evidence-informed insights on health and longevity.

But as a multiyear champion in several track and field events in the National Senior Games, it’s safe to say that he’s been making up for lost time. A Korean War veteran and retired veterinarian, Don spent much of his day-to-day life on his feet, but it wasn’t until his late 50s that he started devoting specific attention toward exercise. What started with daily walks evolved into jogging, which eventually led him to become a perennial competitor in the South Dakota Senior Games and National Senior Games. Don’s streak came to a halt with a decade of health issues and surgeries in the early 2000s, but in 2011, at 81 years old, he decided to find out if he still had what it took to compete. He returned to running and won his first gold medal—followed by another five—at the National Games in 2015. He’s been competing in running events ever since, and over the last couple of years he’s expanded his repertoire to include field events like shot put and discus, as well as powerlifting and cornhole. Today, Don is ranked as a top-ten athlete for his age group in several events according to World Masters Athletics and believes that exercise—along with his 72-year marriage and three children—has been his secret to a long and happy life.2 The sexpert Sexual health is an important part of overall health and wellness but is often overlooked and neglected—especially for those in the latter decades of life. Enter Doreen Wendt-Weir, the 97-year-old Australian sex author. After a successful career as a midwife, Doreen began a new chapter by pursuing a degree in journalism at age 71, but while completing her studies, she became aware of the lack of research and discussion regarding sex among older individuals, and she sought to fill this gap. Using information and questions she gathered from interviews with a number of seniors, Doreen published her first book, Sex in Your Seventies, to address the unique concerns and considerations related to sexuality and relationships later in life, kick-starting her second career as a sought-after “sexpert” for the older demographic. At the age of 93, Doreen published a sequel, Gardening in Your Nineties, which discusses intimacy as well as issues such as loneliness and staying active at an advanced age.3 The entertainer In selecting individuals for these spotlights, we like to focus on those who are relatively unknown—everyday people who happen to be living inspiring lives in their later years. But in choosing this year’s list, the team just couldn’t help returning to a particular household name: Dick Van Dyke. Just last week, the legendary comedian, dancer, and actor—whose career has spanned eight decades—celebrated his 100th birthday. His name has become almost synonymous with living fully at any age, though the road hasn’t always been easy. In his 40s, the Mary Poppins actor was told he would likely be unable to walk independently within a few years due to arthritis, which motivated him to commit to an exercise regimen that he believes has kept him going ever since. (Far from being immobile, Van Dyke is still dancing.) The entertainer has also been open about his past battles with alcoholism, which led him to quit drinking for good in the 1970s. Despite these challenges, Van Dyke—who just released an autobiography titled 100 Rules for Living to 100—has maintained a positive and enthusiastic outlook on life, which he credits for his longevity.4 “A hundred years is not enough,” he said in a recent interview. “You wanna live more, which I plan to.”5 The adventure traveler Ten years ago, at age 85, Joy Ryan regretted that she had never seen a mountain, so when her grandson Brad invited her to join him on a camping trip in the Great Smoky Mountains, she packed her bags. The trip inspired another, and another, and another—from climbing sand dunes in Colorado to dog-sledding in Alaska—until, in 2023, Joy set a record at age 93 as the oldest person to visit every national park in the United States and its territories. But she wasn’t ready to stop. Even after surviving the deaths of her husband and two of her sons, Joy doesn’t believe in giving up, noting in an interview that, “you gotta live it up while you can.”6 Since receiving her first passport at age 91, she and Brad have been endeavoring to visit all seven continents, a goal that has already taken them to Africa, South America, and Antarctica. They’ve gained thousands of cheerleaders on social media along the way (@grandmajoysroadtrip), documenting their adventures in the hopes that they might inspire others. As Joy herself puts it: “Lean into the possibilities for your life at every age instead of focusing on the limitations. You may not be able to climb the highest mountain in a national park, but you can find an adventure that will enrich your life no matter your age or ability.”7 The bottom line Setting records or gaining fame certainly isn’t required in order to live life to the fullest in our later years. But as the individuals on this list show us, living well at any age often requires that we challenge our perceived limitations, whether they be related to age, sex, health, or otherwise. Challenging ourselves physically and mentally doesn’t just raise the likelihood of a longer life—it raises the likelihood of a better life, in which we’re able to engage in activities and relationships that bring us joy and fulfillment. And whether you’re 19 or 90, it’s never too late (or too early) to start taking steps towards greater health and happiness.

      "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter tackles a wide-ranging set of listener questions spanning lifespan interventions, exercise, cardiovascular risk reduction, time-restricted eating, blood pressure management, hormone therapy, diagnostics, and more. Peter reveals the single most important lever for extending healthspan and lifespan, and explains how he motivates midlife patients using the Centenarian Decathlon framework. He discusses the importance of addressing high apoB and cholesterol even in metabolically healthy individuals with calcium scores of zero, how to manage high blood pressure, and how to accurately evaluate metabolic health beyond HbA1c. Additional topics include time-restricted eating, practical considerations around ultra-processed foods, nuanced approaches to HRT for women and TRT for men, and why early and expanded screening for chronic disease—colonoscopy, PSA, coronary imaging, low-dose CT—can be lifesaving. He also offers insights into treating prediabetes, crafting exercise programs for those short on time, and safely incorporating high-intensity training in older adults.

Show Notes Introducing a wide-ranging AMA: practical perspectives on lifespan interventions, metabolic health, diet, hormones, diagnostics, and more [A: 2:45, V: 0:10] Episode format Answer questions from listeners on various, unrelated topics Rather than a deep dive into the science, this will be more about Peter’s thinking, philosophy, and approach both personally and/or clinically Variety of topics: apoB blood pressure metabolic dysfunction time-restricted eating and fasting ultra-processed food HRT Testosterone screening and diagnostics Prediabetes Time-efficient exercise plans And more Why exercise is the most powerful single intervention for lifespan and healthspan [A: 4:15, V: 1:49] If you can only do one intervention for life span, what is the one “non-negotiable”? If every lifespan intervention disappeared except one, exercise would remain the essential, non-negotiable intervention. This conclusion does not change when shifting the question from lifespan to healthspan. Exercise outperforms other interventions — including smoking cessation, hypertension management, lipid management, and reducing type 2 diabetes — when looking at disease-specific and all-cause mortality. Cardiovascular fitness provides a larger mortality benefit than other modifiable risk-reduction strategies. Muscular strength contributes independently to mortality reduction. Muscle mass also provides benefits, although it appears to have a smaller effect size than strength and fitness. The most significant decline in quality of life during the final decade is typically driven by movement limitations, chronic pain, poor stability, and declining physical fitness. Training throughout life directly addresses these determinants of reduced healthspan. Exercise therefore simultaneously extends lifespan and preserves functional capacity, making it the most effective single intervention across both domains. ⇒ Check out AMA #71 for more on the importance of muscular strength, muscle mass, and cardiorespiratory fitness for longevity How Peter motivates midlife patients to prioritize exercise [A: 6:00, V: 3:48] Why future functional goals must be addressed now Many people in their 30s–50s feel fully capable today and therefore assume they can delay exercise until later in life. The decline they will face decades later is hard to appreciate when everything feels easy in the present. Using the Centenarian Decathlon to make the future tangible {end of show notes preview}",

      "title": "Hope for millions: the selfless work of the “world’s most important doctor”",
      "content": "With global news flooded with stories of conflict and violence, it’s easy to grow numb and slip into a sense of resignation—a sense that the world is just a brutal place, and how could one person ever hope to change anything? But even when international affairs seem most bleak, I remind myself of one person who has been quietly bringing about that change for the last 20 years—and continues to do so to this day—in a region often forgotten by the rest of us. It would be hard to overstate the goodwill and hope that Dr. Tom Catena brings to the world. As a missionary surgeon in war-torn Sudan, Dr. Catena—affectionately known as “Dr. Tom” by those with whom he works—serves millions in need. Indeed, my entire vocabulary seems insufficient for describing my admiration for this man and his work, an admiration that has only grown since I interviewed him on the podcast nearly seven years ago (and referred to him as the “world’s most important doctor”). Thus, I will instead allow his mission to speak for itself—and hopefully to inspire others to be a part of the change he is creating. A life of service and courage As a college athlete at Brown University, Tom Catena felt called to a life of service, motivating his decision to pursue a career in healthcare. After completing his residency in family medicine, Tom sought to apply his training as a missionary physician in Kenya, gaining skills in surgery and infectious disease treatment in order to better care for the underserved, rural communities of that region. Yet while he was there, Tom learned of an area still more desperate for health services. In the nearby country of Sudan, the isolated region of the Nuba Mountains had been a target of religious and political violence, and health facilities for handling the number of injured and infirm were virtually non-existent. Thus, Dr. Catena worked with Catholic officials to establish a facility to serve the Nuba people, and in 2008, he moved to one of the most dangerous areas in the world to take the helm of the new Mother of Mercy Hospital. For three years, he oversaw a meager staff of seven nurses, anesthetists, and lab technicians from Kenya and Uganda (he was the only physician), as well as a growing number of untrained staff members from the local Nuba region. But in 2011, civil war erupted across Sudan. All foreign members of the hospital staff fled the country for safety—all except Dr. Catena. Despite encouragement to evacuate, Tom felt a deep responsibility to the 750,000 Nuba people who would otherwise have no options for medical care, and he remained alongside local staff even as the hospital itself was targeted by air raids over the years of conflict that ensued. Seeing hundreds of patients each day as the sole surgeon in the war-ravaged region, Dr. Catena has saved countless lives with unimaginably limited resources, and his courage and humanitarian efforts were recognized in 2017 when he was awarded the second annual Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity.

War broke out again in 2023, displacing millions of Sudanese, many of whom sought refuge in the Nuba region. Food shortages have led to a declaration of famine in the area, exacerbated by a blockade against humanitarian aid.1 And over the past year, Nuba itself has become a target for attacks, with the Sudanese army massacring untold numbers of civilians in what the United Nations has called “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.”2 But even against this nightmarish backdrop, the hospital has persisted in its mission. With the help of their philanthropic partner, African Mission Healthcare, they’ve expanded their volume of patients and built new satellite clinics in response to the crises. Dr. Catena is the only surgeon for the estimated three million individuals currently in the region, and in 2024, Mother of Mercy provided care for around 300,000 patients—including an astounding 2,642 major surgeries. The hospital’s 19 outpatient clinics further extended this impact, handling an additional 212,000 patient visits. Among those treated have been hundreds of children suffering from malnutrition, individuals of all ages who have sustained life-threatening injuries during the ongoing conflict, and over one thousand expectant mothers. To further expand access to care and ensure the future of healthcare in the region, Mother of Mercy has also instituted a training school, which recently graduated its first class of 19 physician’s assistants. All of this has been accomplished on a shoestring annual budget of just over $3 million, which covers every medication, procedure, piece of equipment, operating cost, and salary for the whole hospital and training school. <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1024x513.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36095\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1024x513.jpeg 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-768x384.jpeg 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-400x200.jpeg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" /> Still, the conflict is taking its toll. Resources in the Nuba region—and at Mother of Mercy Hospital—have been strained by the influx of refugees, even as the ongoing violence and famine drive greater need for life-saving medical care. Indeed, despite condemnation by the UN, there appears to be no end in sight for the attacks against civilians. Just over the last two weeks, at least 162 people— most of them children—have been killed in strikes on schools and a hospital in the area.3 But if we can learn anything from Dr. Catena, it’s that each of us, even in the face of unspeakable horrors, has the power to stand as a force for good in the world—whether through a lifetime at the front lines or through small gestures of support wherever possible. How you can help As I said at the outset, Dr. Catena’s impact and courage defies overstatement, and by the time of our interview seven years ago, he was already recognized as one of the world’s great humanitarians. He’d received numerous awards, and his work had been the subject of a documentary film, The Heart of Nuba. Yet one of his most striking qualities during our conversation was how readily he praised the sacrifices and contributions of others for the work and progress that has taken place at Mother of Mercy Hospital over the years—from those working alongside him to the patients who would travel miles on foot to the hospital, and from a New York Times reporter who brought attention to the work4 to the donors who have helped to keep the hospital going. “Everybody has something to contribute,” he said, and I write this newsletter in an effort to spread that message to all who might find hope and inspiration from Tom’s story. The simplest way to support the work of Dr. Catena and the Mother of Mercy Hospital is by donating through African Mission Healthcare (https://africanmissionhealthcare.org/donation/catena/). The hospital has proven to be incredibly resourceful in maximizing the impact of every dollar they receive, and every little bit helps. For instance, just $25 per month for one year (less than $1 per day) covers the cost of an entire surgery, while a donation of $6,600 pays for the full training of a physician assistant, each of whom will go on to treat an estimated 80,000 patients over the course of their career. (Compare this to the US, where PA training programs typically run well over $100,000.) I don’t feel I could share this request for donations without noting that my family and I have been supporting Tom since I first met him in 2018, and I’ve truly felt that helping to support his work has been one of the great philanthropic privileges of my life. Beyond financial contributions, you can also support the hospital by raising awareness of their life-saving work and of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Sudan. Share this newsletter or additional coverage of Tom’s work with others (e.g., The Heart of Nuba documentary or resources on the African Mission Healthcare website). So the next time you feel cynicism or resignation over world events, remember that you do have the power to create change, even for just one person at a time. As Tom put it, “it’s a huge privilege to have the opportunity to affect one person…somebody that can laugh, and can cry, and can play, has aspirations, and is a living, breathing human being…It’s everything to that one person.” For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama References Popoviciu A, Peterson G.

      "title": "#375 – The ketogenic diet, ketosis, and hyperbaric oxygen: metabolic therapies for weight loss, cognitive enhancement, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, brain injuries, and more | Dominic D’Agostino, Ph.D.",
      "content": "Dom D’Agostino is a neuroscientist and professor at the forefront of metabolic therapies, including ketogenic diets, exogenous ketones, and hyperbaric oxygen. In this episode, Dom breaks down nutritional versus supplemental ketosis, defines meaningful ketone thresholds, and outlines practical ways to achieve ketosis. He explains how a ketogenic diet can support metabolic health and weight loss, and advises on how to maintain adequate protein and avoid common mistakes. Dom surveys the growing landscape of exogenous ketones—from salts and esters to 1,3-butanediol—and effective pairings like caffeine, MCT oil, and alpha-GPC. He highlights the role of ketogenic therapy in cancer (particularly glioblastoma) and its promise for neurodegenerative diseases. The conversation also covers recommended hyperbaric oxygen protocols for brain injuries and cognitive function, situations where fasting or ketones offer cognitive and anti-inflammatory benefits, and touches on the carnivore diet as a ketogenic variant with potential relevance for autoimmune and metabolic conditions.

Show Notes Dom and Peter’s shared interest in ketosis, and Dom’s scientific journey [A: 2:30, V: 0:11] It’s been a long time since Peter has seen Dom in person Dom sees Peter’s brother (Paul) a lot more Paul’s an amazing entrepreneurial mentor and a life mentor Dom has been on this podcast a couple of times [Episodes #05, #116, and #120] We’ve probably got hundreds of thousands of listeners today that weren’t listeners the first and second time he was on the podcast And for those that were, it would be understandable that they’ve forgotten most of what we’ve spoken about Just by way of background, Peter explains how he and Dom are connected Ken Ford connected them back in 2011-ish At the time, Peter was about a year into experimenting with a ketogenic diet Having all sorts of interesting success with it for the most part ‒ once he got over the hump of figuring out how to do it We must have connected at his institute, and then the rest is kind of history We then, through our friendship became very deeply involved in the testing of the earliest generations of various forms of synthetic ketones A topic we will undoubtedly get to today because it’s impossible to imagine how much proliferation there has been of these things that were How Dom’s interest in this space came to be Peter recalls that Dom’s Ph.D. was in neuroscience Yeah, nutrition He started doing an undergraduate thesis project in neuroscience and the neural control of autonomic regulation Specifically the brain network, the rostral ventrolateral medulla This is the brain stem network that controls respiration ‒ inspiratory neurons, expiratory neurons, and how they respond to oxygen and CO2 And that led him down the path of oxygen, hypoxia, hyperoxia, hypercapnia, extreme environments What happens to the brain under oxygen deprivation and nutrient deprivation At the time, he was interested in alpha-L-Polylactate because it was in Cytomax, which was something he used because he raced mountain bikes Dom was testing some things lactate, and then he got steered onto the ketogenic diet after getting a postdoctoral fellowship by the Office of Navy Research Which is part of the Department of Defense to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of central nervous system oxygen toxicity, which manifests as seizures Dom was mostly interested in drugs, but then he pivoted and went back to the ketogenic diet because it works for so many different seizure disorders when drugs fail He was gravitating towards a tenure track position, and everybody told him this was the dumbest thing to do You can’t get NIH funding with ketogenic, nobody had heard of the ketogenic diet This was around 2005 Dom started tinkering with ketones In 2007 he started writing grants, and in 2008 he got a postdoctoral grant It was very sizable ‒ like a NIH-level grant and it paid full indirects That came from the Office of Navy Research (part of the Department of Defense) His position went from postdoc to something called a Research Assistant Professor Which is like an intermediate position before you get into tenure track The university was gauging his productivity Dom got good data on hyperbaric atomic force microscopy, very mechanistic research He also did patch clamp electrophysiology and confocal microscopy His work was really focused on redox mechanisms and looking at superoxide production under graded levels of oxygen and different metabolites In the process of doing all that, he had no interest in cancer, but he had some glioblastoma cells and he threw them into the hyperbaric chamber And under confocal microscopy, he could see the mitochondria were lighting up and then kind of exploding or disappearing in the cancer cells That was kind of unique, and that led him on a side tangent thing to study cancer But the central thing that he studied was neuroscience He’s been in the neuroscience department and mainly focused on that Dom’s work for the Navy on oxygen toxicity [A: 7:00, V: 5:40] The problem with too much oxygen and Dom’s work for the Navy Folks might not understand why the navy would be interested in the effects of too much oxygen When you think of the navy, you think of being underwater When you think of being underwater, you think of oxygen deprivation What is it about certain types of diving that actually bring about the opposite problem? You experience that with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and there’s 14 different FDA approved applications In that context, you only go to about a maximum of 2.5 to 3.0 atmospheres of pure oxygen In the context of military diving, like a Navy SEAL use a closed circuit rebreather because there’s no bubbles So there’s a stealth component to that You’re breathing high concentrations of oxygen, and at 50 feet of seawater, the potential for oxygen toxicity exists Explain what oxygen toxicity is How does a rebreather work? What is the concentration of oxygen they’re breathing in? A closed circuit rebreather, for example, like a Drӓger rebreather, those early rebreathers and even now it’s high concentration You’re breathing 100% oxygen, so there’s no nitrogen There’s 80% nitrogen in the air we’re right now There’s no nitrogen [in a rebreather] so you avert the potential for nitrogen narcosis So nitrogen is not narcotic at one atmosphere, but you get something called the Martini effect As you go down lower, nitrogen becomes narcotic (that’s something else that Dom studies) You’re breathing 100% oxygen, and then there’s a CO2 scrubber So you’re blowing out the exhaled carbon dioxide is scrubbed out from the breather And it’s a closed circuit, so there is no off gassing associated with scuba diving or even other types of technical diving where you have some off gassing Peter adds the reason they can do that is because you’re not wasting gas on the 80% nitrogen You basically store the CO2 that’s coming out Once you’ve scrubbed it, you’ve got pure O2 coming in So your volume of air needed is much lower because you’re just solving for the oxygen Dom explains that the oxygen tanks are pretty small [that are used] with a rebreather Analogy to understand why the Navy uses a rebreather {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

Become a Member Dominic D’Agostino, Ph.D. Dominic “Dom” D’Agostino earned a BS in Biological Sciences and Nutrition Science from Rutgers University then completed his Ph.D. in Neuroscience at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Dr. D’Agostino completed postdoctoral research with Dr. Jay B. Dean in the Department of Neuroscience, Cell Biology and Physiology at Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine in Dayton, OH. He was also a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of South Florida (USF) Morsani College of Medicine in Tampa, FL. He continued at USF as an Assistant Professor and is and currently is a tenured Associate Professor in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology at the USF Morsani College of Medicine. Dr. D’Agostino is also a Senior Visiting Research Scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC). Dr. D’Agostino’s laboratory develops and tests metabolic-based strategies for targeting CNS oxygen toxicity (seizures), epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. The main focus of his lab over the last 10 years has been understanding the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective mechanism of the ketogenic diet and ketone metabolite supplementation.

      "title": "Is there a tradeoff between muscle size and aerobic capacity?",
      "content": "A common question in athletic communities is whether tension exists between the goals of increasing muscle size and increasing muscle endurance. Bodybuilders chase hypertrophy and with it strength, while endurance athletes pursue greater oxidative capacity. A hybrid athlete might look for a mix of both—but is there anything physiologically preventing a hybrid athlete from being world class at bodybuilding and world class at long-distance running at the same time? In everyday terms, will resistance training worsen my performance in endurance sports, or will endurance training reduce my muscle size? A recent study examined the physics and physiology of muscle fibers to address this question, ultimately identifying an upper limit to the capacity of an individual fiber to be both very large and oxidatively efficient.1,2 We can’t outrun physics An important constraint on all of biology is the surface-area-to-volume ratio of cells. As cells grow larger, their volume increases much more rapidly than their surface area (for people who like math, it’s because volume increases by a 3rd power while surface area increases by a 2nd power), resulting in two key problems for the cell. First, the core areas of the cell become increasingly distant from the cell surface, creating a “dead space” in the middle of the cell into which it is difficult to transport vital molecules like glucose and oxygen. Second, the cell’s demand for nutrients and oxygen (related to its volume) increases more than the cell’s means of acquiring nutrients and oxygen (i.e., transport and diffusion of these molecules from capillaries covering the cell’s surface. These constraints on nutrient diffusion and access are largely what limit the size and functional capacities of a single cell (there are no bacteria the size of baseballs, after all), and muscle fibers are no exception. As a single fiber gets larger, it cannot sustain the same relative aerobic capacity that it could at a smaller size. With a lower surface-area-to-volume ratio, the distance between the cell membrane and the central areas of the cell becomes larger and the same number of capillaries must support larger demands. Together, these challenges mean that it becomes progressively more difficult to suffuse the cell with nutrients. Conversely, a cell operating at maximum aerobic capacity will not be able to increase its size too much or the mitochondria inside will start losing easy access to nutrients and oxygen. At the single-fiber level, then, geometry and physics would predict that a fiber cannot be both massive and maximally oxidative. In a recent paper, researchers Degens et al. sought to put this predicted tradeoff to the test, examining data from mice and humans to quantify the relationships between fiber size, oxidative capacity, and capillary density—and how these variables impose limits on each other.

From each sample, the authors measured cross-sectional area, oxidative capacity (assessed through measurement of succinate dehydrogenase activity), and capillary supply for the individual muscle fibers present. The results were remarkably consistent: a curvilinear, universal upper constraint ties together muscle fiber size and oxidative capacity. As cross-sectional area increased, oxidative capacity decreased, and vice-versa, following the same curve across species, muscle types, ages, and training levels (see Figure below). Indeed, the relationship held constant even in resistance-trained athletes with muscle fibers almost double the size of normal human fibers, as well as in mice, a species with much smaller muscle fiber diameters than humans. In other words, the investigators identified a measurable, highly consistent ceiling that limits large fibers from being maximally aerobically efficient and aerobically efficient fibers from becoming too large. <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"561\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1024x561.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36005\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1024x561.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-300x164.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-768x421.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-400x219.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" />Figure: The relationship between muscle fiber oxidative capacity and cross-sectional area follows a consistent curve. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a measure of oxidative capacity, and fiber cross-sectional area (FCSA) were plotted across samples from mice (white circles), recreationally active humans (black circles), and highly resistance-trained men before (dark gray circles) and after (light gray circles) a 10-week endurance training program. From Degens et al. 2025.1 Implications for training goals At first, these data might seem discouraging for those hoping to build both strength and aerobic capacity. Yet although Degens et al.’s results may validate certain geometric restrictions on individual muscle fibers, they do not imply that you must sacrifice gains in one endpoint to improve in the other. First, we must bear in mind that this paper identified a ceiling effect, but most people are nowhere near the ceiling. If you are an elite athlete trying to win the Tour de France or break a powerlifting world record, you may have to give some consideration to the tradeoff between fiber size and aerobic capacity. But for the rest of us, we have plenty of room to add endurance capacity and increase muscle fiber size at the same time. Indeed, we can even see evidence of this in the study results—the bulk of the distribution of datapoints from recreationally active adults falls well below the curve in the Figure above, indicating that they were still operating below the ceiling at which tradeoffs might occur. It is also important to note that this dynamic applies to individual muscle fibers. Entire muscles will be composed of a variety of diverse types of muscles, and your body will adapt to training with the creation of an appropriate mix of muscle fiber types. Thus, on the level of the whole muscle, you can grow in strength while retaining high aerobic capacity, even if a tradeoff exists at the level of any specific muscle fiber. The bottom line A consistent, measurable ceiling limits the size and concurrent oxidative capacity of individual muscle fibers, and for elite athletes, this ceiling may indeed have important implications for training decisions. For instance, it might mean that an Olympic marathon runner may not be simultaneously competitive as a professional bodybuilder and vice versa. But for the rest of us, we can have our cake and eat it, too. Below the elite end of the spectrum, we can safely assume that our muscle fibers have plenty of room for improving in both size and oxidative capacity. We can continue to engage in a mix of endurance training and resistance training without having to choose between these two modalities—both of which are vital for long-term health and physical function.

      "title": "Alcohol and healthspan: knowing the risks and how to mitigate them",
      "content": "Alcohol occupies a complex and often contradictory role in society, celebrated for its social and cultural significance yet scrutinized for its potential to harm health. While moderate drinking has long been associated with certain health benefits, recent research increasingly challenges these assumptions, revealing risks even at low levels of consumption. At the same time, societal attitudes toward alcohol are shifting, with growing awareness of its negative impact on long-term health and quality of life. In fact, in 2023, the World Health Organization declared there is no safe dose of alcohol consumption. The popular press headlines on the topic are leaving light-to-moderate drinkers asking, “how worried should I be?” Against this backdrop, we are dedicating this premium article to an examination of alcohol’s effects on health, focusing not just on how it influences lifespan (as discussed in a previous premium piece) but also on its more immediate and profound effects on healthspan—the portion of life spent in good health. We will explore the relationship between alcohol and the four horsemen of chronic disease, outline day-to-day cumulative impacts of alcohol consumption, present potential disease risk modifiers, and summarize approaches for alcohol harm reduction—including not only strategies for drinking less, but also strategies for making any alcohol you do consume less damaging. In sum, this piece provides a realistic, quantified look at the risks associated with alcohol consumption, allowing you to find a balanced, risk-informed relationship with alcohol.",

      "title": "#374 – The evolutionary biology of testosterone: how it shapes male development and sex-based behavioral differences | Carole Hooven, Ph.D.",
      "content": "Carole Hooven is a human evolutionary biologist whose research centers on testosterone, sex differences, and behavior. In this episode, she explores how prenatal testosterone orchestrates male development in the body and brain, how early hormonal surges shape lifelong behavioral tendencies, and what rare natural experiments—such as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency—reveal about the biology of sex differentiation. She discusses distinct male and female aggression styles through an evolutionary lens, how modern environments interact with ancient competitive drives, and the implications of attempting to suppress them. The conversation also covers testosterone across the lifespan, the role of hormone therapy in both men and women, and Carole’s own experience after surgical menopause, culminating in a broader discussion of masculinity, cultural narratives, and the consequences of denying biological sex differences.

Show Notes How Carole became interested in exploring the biological and evolutionary roots of sex differences and the role of testosterone [A: 2:30, V: 0:11] Sex hormones are a topic that we talk a lot about on the podcast, but usually from a pretty narrow lens, which is in the form of replacement (both in men and women) We talk about how they wax and wane as an individual ages We talk about the medical use of them But we haven’t spent any time understanding the more basic fundamentals of these hormones The role they play in our evolution Anecdotally, Peter shares an observation that any parent probably has, if they have male and female children His first child was a girl, and his wife and he very stupidly and arrogantly thought they were the perfect parents, because she was so well-behaved They were like, “What do all of these other parents with their boys running around misbehaving… What are they doing wrong? How could we teach them how to be as good as we are?” They didn’t actually say that, but there was undoubtedly an annoying smugness to them And if you believe in a God, that God smacked them into their place with 2 boys that followed who were, for all intents and purposes, treated the same way, socialized the same way And there is a level of aggression in them, a fury in them that Peter has never seen, probably unless he were to go back and hear stories of what his mom said he was like His boys are now 8 and almost 11 Peter adds, “I wouldn’t say they’re a different sex. I would say they’re a different species.” Peter doesn’t feel that they did anything different [parenting the boys] And yet, they couldn’t be more different He appreciates that that’s not going to be the case for every parent What Peter hopes to learn is how much testosterone has to do with that Because he is also under the impression that at this age, the testosterone levels wouldn’t be that much different We’ll probably talk about the differences in testosterone levels during the embryologic phase, because obviously that led to the differences That is a backdrop to this conversation How did you get interested in this topic? Carole grew up with 3 older brothers, and they were different than she was in some consistent ways Though she didn’t think much about it at the time That probably made her want to understand what motivates male behavior in general and why it’s different from female behavior Studying this wasn’t an idea she had when she was in college But she did become intensely interested in the evolutionary origins of human behavior in general and what makes us different from other animals And that was because of traveling She traveled by herself to a lot of different places in the world, during and after college There were extreme differences culturally ‒ Egypt was a place that really freaked her out The cultural differences were so profound in terms of the incredibly important role that sex plays in social life and the segregation and different rules that applied to males and females Carole was alone, traveling by herself as a young woman, totally ignorant of what she was getting into in Egypt She was harassed endlessly Some of that was her fault for not understanding the culture well enough and what she was getting into This combination of being immersed in, not only different societies that treated sex and sex roles very differently, but also different ecologies She spent some time in Africa and Kenya and Tanzania and got really interested in all of the animal behavior and why we are different from other animals She had a whole other career before graduate school, and she ended up leaving that career and applying to Harvard to try to do a graduate degree where she could do more to understand the evolutionary basis of human behavior She ended up getting rejected She just persisted and then was offered this job out in Uganda studying chimps for what was supposed to be a year ‒ that is what really triggered her interest in sex differences and testosterone Because to a certain extent, we are indoctrinated to believe that most human sex differences are cultural Or if you think that they’re not, it’s better you don’t say that out loud to too many people or in the wrong place When she spent time with the chimps, she was really blown away by the ways that the sex differences in the chimps paralleled human sex differences Of course, not exactly the same, but the very basic things that Peter just described in terms of energy and aggression, are present in the chimps in terms of being higher in the males and lower in the females The reasons for that are so profound and far-reaching and start with sperm and egg That’s what sex really is about Not just the ability to produce sperm or eggs But the way that the organism is designed and the reproductive phenotype including body and behavior [explored more in this essay Carole recommends] That, in humans, plays out in these really complex ways in terms of social systems Carole got interested in testosterone because this is one thing she could grab onto that links very clearly humans, chimpanzees, every other mammal in terms of males having much higher levels than females And it’s not just mammals; there are other forms of steroid hormones that other species have But this is pervasive and just a very powerful way to understand proximately that means what’s happening here and now in the organism, why the sexes are different There are these deep evolutionary pressures that have to do with reproductive strategies for organisms that produce sperm versus organisms that produce eggs She ended up reapplying to Harvard and getting into the grad program there Carole did her dissertation on testosterone and sex differences in cognition, the way we think and process information She had men watch sexy videos and also videos of dental surgery and collected their saliva and measured their testosterone in the lab Then she stayed on at Harvard, mostly just teaching How testosterone and other hormones influence sex differences in aggression and behavior across species [A: 9:45, V: 8:25] Peter wants to go back to the distinction between mammals and non-mammals He never really thought of it until she mentioned this Differences if he were to look at a male great white shark and a female great white shark Do great white sharks have testosterone in them as the androgen or sex hormone? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Oldies-But-Goodies: November 2025 Edition",
      "content": "This week, I’m sharing another collection of oldies-but-goodies—pieces from our newsletter archive that address a variety of topics of continued interest to our audience. Some provide additional context for recent or upcoming content; some address frequently asked questions; and some are simply worth repeating for anyone who might have missed them. The world of biomedical science is constantly evolving, but in evaluating what has changed, we like to pause now and then to acknowledge information and ideas that have remained relevant despite the passage of time—a celebration of “aging well,” if you will. Reducing heavy alcohol intake: a lifeline for cardiovascular health Amid the growing popularity of “dry January” and the exploding market for zero-proof alternatives to alcoholic beverages, it’s clear that more and more individuals are rethinking their drinking habits and relationship with alcohol. Indeed, mounting evidence points to numerous negative consequences of alcohol on both lifespan and healthspan, yet many still believe that after a lifetime of heavy drinking, change might come too late. This piece, originally published last summer, highlights results of a study that contradict this belief—demonstrating meaningful improvements in cardiovascular health among former heavy drinkers who reduce their intake even modestly.1 The article serves as a timely companion for a soon-to-be-released premium article in which we examine more closely the impacts of alcohol across the four horsemen of longevity and consider various strategies for mitigating risk. Do humans age in distinct rapid bursts instead of gradually over time? Last year, a study published in Nature Aging reported that humans tend to age most rapidly at two distinct points in life—corresponding to around ages 44 and 60—rather than aging evenly throughout adulthood.2 The study gained such widespread attention that we’re still frequently asked about it over a year later, with some individuals even noting whether their own experiences have or have not aligned with the alleged “aging bursts.” So in light of the continued interest, we are re-sharing our commentary on the study, which explains why the results of this study might be misleading—and why you shouldn’t fear your 44th or 60th birthday any more than any others.

Even those of us who are committed to keeping up our exercise regimens can be tempted to settle for the bare minimum—but what exactly is the “bare minimum”? It’s one of the most common questions we receive about exercise. But despite the surplus of pop science articles claiming that “you only need [x] minutes of exercise per week!,” there is no such thing as a universal, optimal amount of time you should be devoting to physical activity. As this newsletter explains, focusing on “time served” distracts from what really matters—i.e., whether you’re seeing improvements in your cardiorespiratory health and strength. Clearing the air on hormone replacement therapy Earlier this month, the US FDA and Department of Health and Human Services announced that they would soon lift the current requirements for “black box” warning labels on menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products. As we will address in a future newsletter, this shift has the potential for both positive and negative impacts, but we nevertheless believe that it corrects a decades-old misstep that deprived countless women of improved health and quality of life during and after menopause. In this newsletter from 2023, we take an in-depth look at the alleged risks and benefits of HRT—and how misinterpretation of research prompted the demonization of HRT for more than a generation. “The cholesterol paradox”: a catchy phrase for an idea with no substance Ideas that completely upend long-established wisdom make for good headlines. Perhaps this is why, every so often, a handful of researchers come along claiming to have evidence that undermines the connection between high serum cholesterol and negative impacts on health. This piece from 2023 describes one such study, in which the authors profess to have uncovered a “cholesterol paradox,” in which high cholesterol levels—conventionally known to increase risk of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide—were paradoxically associated with reduced mortality.3 Yet as the newsletter explains, convention-defying concepts must be subject to the same level of scrutiny as the conventions themselves. In this case, the so-called “paradox” doesn’t hold up, but it serves as a timeless reminder that flashy headlines and catchphrases often distract from flawed science—especially when they claim to contradict established concepts supported by decades of evidence.

      "title": "Cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1 drugs independent of weight loss",
      "content": "Sometimes, the simplest explanation is not the one that turns out to be correct. Two years ago, published results from the “SELECT” trial demonstrated that the GLP-1 receptor agonist drug semaglutide (trade names Wegovy and Ozempic)—already known for its remarkable efficacy in combating obesity and type II diabetes—was also effective in reducing incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, defined as heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death) among non-diabetic patients with overweight or obesity.1 The findings fueled even greater excitement over the seemingly limitless therapeutic uses of GLP-1 drugs—not only could they promote weight loss and glycemic control, but they also appeared to have the additional effect of cardiovascular protection. But in our subsequent commentary, we proposed a simpler (and less exciting) explanation for the results: the reduction in MACE risk with semaglutide was likely due to the weight loss elicited by the medication—not to other, unique benefits for cardiovascular health. After all, study participants had BMIs in the overweight or obese categories at baseline, and excess fat mass is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events. And since the original publication offered no indication that the investigators had attempted to control for body weight changes or employed other strategies to address their potential influence on cardiovascular results, we arrived at our conclusion by applying an intuitive principle of problem-solving commonly known as Occam’s razor or the “principle of parsimony”: “of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred.”2 Yet a new analysis of SELECT trial results refutes our alternative explanation—reminding us that biology is often anything but simple.3 A refresher on the SELECT trial As a refresher, the SELECT trial represented the first efforts to specifically investigate cardiovascular (CV) endpoints with GLP-1 receptor agonist medications. To better isolate potential CV effects from the more established effects of these drugs on diabetes management, the researchers chose to study overweight or obese patients without diabetes (mean BMI: 33.3±5.0). A total of 17,604 participants were enrolled and randomized to receive either placebo or semaglutide (2.4 mg maximal dose) once weekly for a mean duration of 34.2±13.7 months. Results showed that a greater proportion of subjects in the placebo group experienced MACE over the follow-up period (701 of 8,801 patients, or 8.0%) than in the semaglutide group (569 of 8,803 patients, or 6.5%). This corresponded to a relative risk reduction of 20% with semaglutide (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.72-0.90; P<0.001) relative to placebo—a considerable effect on par with the protection afforded by other classes of CV medications such as statins or PCSK9 inhibitors. However, it’s important to note that individuals in the semaglutide also experienced significantly greater weight loss than the placebo group. Compared to an average loss of just 0.88±0.08% of baseline body weight in the placebo group by 104 weeks post-randomization, patients in the semaglutide arm had lost an average of 9.39±0.09%. Applying Occam’s razor to these results Data from the SELECT trial clearly demonstrated that semaglutide could reduce risk of MACE among patients with overweight or obesity, but the fact that participants on this drug also lost more weight raised a critical question as to whether we could truly interpret these results as evidence of an independent effect on CV health. As we pointed out in our commentary two years ago, any intervention that reduces fat mass and improves metabolic health would be expected to cause a reduction in CV risk as well, as weight reduction typically results in a reduction in blood pressure, circulating lipid levels, inflammation, and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The investigators didn’t attempt to control for weight loss effects by imposing calorie restriction or other weight-matching strategies on the placebo group, nor did they perform any analyses on their data that might correct for the weight loss discrepancy. Thus, we were left with two possibilities that were equally capable of explaining the results reported two years ago. Either the reduction in MACE among participants in the semaglutide group represented a distinct physiological effect of the drug that was independent of its effects on appetite and glycemic control, or the apparent CV protection was a secondary effect of weight loss and improved metabolic health. The latter explanation, though less desirable and exciting from the perspective of therapeutic implications, is the simpler of the two, as it fits with what we already know about how these drugs impact metabolic health and how metabolic health impacts cardiovascular disease. By contrast, the former explanation would require that we make assumptions beyond what we already know to be true—i.e., that semaglutide has previously unknown impacts on CV health that are independent of its metabolic effects. Thus, in alignment with Occam’s razor, we concluded that, “of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred.” But Occam’s razor isn’t an inviolable law—indeed, it’s only useful even as a heuristic when presented with two theories that are otherwise equivalent in their ability to explain a given phenomenon or dataset. That means that when new data arise, we must re-examine whether those theories indeed remain equivalent. And with the recent publication of such new data on semaglutide and MACE reduction, our re-examination has led us to revise our earlier conclusions.

The recent publication shared results of an additional analysis of SELECT trial data in which the authors evaluated the correlation between weight loss from baseline and MACE risk reduction. (Of note, this analysis was prespecified—meaning that the authors had planned on performing this analysis even before collecting data from the original trial.) The logic is straightforward: if the degree of weight loss correlates inversely with MACE rates, then we can conclude that apparent CV benefits are likely secondary to weight loss rather than an independent effect. But that wasn’t what the investigators found in their analysis. Examining the proportion of weight loss at week 20 of the intervention period, the authors observed no correlation between weight loss and subsequent MACE incidence in the semaglutide group over the remainder of the trial using either linear or non-linear models. However, examination of waist circumference changes by week 20 revealed that greater decreases in waist circumference were modestly associated with greater decreases in subsequent MACE risk (HR=0.91; 95% CI: 0.84–0.98; P=0.02), such that changes in waist circumference were estimated to account for 33% of the effect of semaglutide on MACE risk reduction. Total weight loss by week 104 was also modestly associated with MACE risk reduction over the course of the intervention period (HR=0.93; 95% CI: 0.88–0.98; P=0.003). Together, these results indicate that body composition changes on semaglutide may enhance CV benefits of the drug among overweight or obese patients, but they do not fully account for effects on MACE risk reduction, especially early in the course of treatment. The implications of these findings are significant, as they indicate that a lack of substantial weight loss with semaglutide does not preclude the opportunity for improved cardiovascular outcomes. Indeed, the fact that semaglutide can offer cardiovascular benefits across a broad range of adiposity levels and independently of weight loss suggests that this medication might be specifically indicated for cardiovascular disease—that is, outside the context of obesity and diabetes—as opposed to current restrictions based on BMI thresholds. Biology is anything but simple Occam’s razor is a useful heuristic for problem-solving across many disciplines, but biology and medicine are rife with instances where this principle has failed. (Indeed, there’s a principle that specifically opposes Occam’s razor in the context of medicine—Hickam’s dictum, which is typically presented as the observation that “a patient can have as many diseases as they damn well please.”) So although defaulting to the simplest explanation may make sense when all else is equal, biology is often far more complex than we predict, and therefore, we need to be ready to abandon or revise the simpler theory when presented with new information. Such is the case, it would seem, with GLP-1 drugs and cardiovascular benefits. The recent analysis of data from the SELECT trial provides evidence of a cardioprotective benefit of semaglutide that is at least partially independent of weight loss, demonstrating that the physiological effects of this medication may be more complex and multifaceted than previously thought. This opens the door for rethinking current restrictions on the uses of GLP-1 drugs and reassessing existing treatment protocols for cardiovascular disease both within the context of obesity and diabetes and outside of these other conditions. So although Occam’s razor might have failed us in our earlier critiques, in this instance, we couldn’t be more pleased to be proven wrong.

      "content": "Antonio Bianco is a world-renowned physician-scientist and expert in thyroid physiology and metabolism. In this episode, Antonio explores the complex biology of thyroid hormone production, conversion, and regulation—highlighting how deiodinase enzymes modulate hormone activity at the tissue level and why that matters for interpreting lab results. He discusses the shortcomings of relying solely on TSH as a marker of thyroid function, the ongoing debate around combination therapy with T3 and T4 versus standard T4 treatment, and how genetics, tissue sensitivity, and individual variability influence thyroid hormone metabolism. The conversation also examines how hypothyroidism affects energy, mood, cognition, and longevity; why some patients remain symptomatic despite “normal” labs; and how future research could reshape treatment paradigms.

Show Notes How the thyroid produces, stores, and activates hormones like T4 and T3 to finely regulate thyroid activity [A: 2:45, V: 0:11] Galveston is 3 hours away, where Antonio is dean of the medical school and runs a lab Tell me a little bit about what your research focuses on, and maybe even what got you interested in studying the thyroid system? Antonio’s research is trying to understand what thyroid hormone does And by understanding what it does in different tissues, we will be able to serve patients that don’t have sufficient thyroid hormone (patients with hypothyroidism) He focuses on the action of thyroid hormone at the tissue level: What does it do in the liver? What does it do in the heart? But then we go into the cell level, and we are currently looking at how thyroid hormone affects the folding of the chromatin Because that’s how it regulates gene expression Basically that’s how T3 or thyroid hormone acts: by regulating different genes And because the genes are basically the essence of the cell functioning, by regulating the expression of those genes, it changes the way the cell behaves, and that has an important consequence for the whole tissue, and for the organ, and for the body Let’s start with the stuff that is largely known about the thyroid Many people know that they have a gland that sits over the voice box called the thyroid gland and that it produces a hormone Some people might know that the hormone is actually inactive ‒ it’s abbreviated T4, because it has 4 iodines on it And now we’re getting maybe past what most people would know, but enzymes in the body take 1 of those iodines off, and make an active form of that hormone that we abbreviate T3 ⇒ Peter suspects that a number of people watching or listening realize that this hormone [T3] is very important, and it has properties that regulate energy expenditure, body temperature, mood, sleep, all sorts of things The final thing that is probably common knowledge is that it is not entirely uncommon that some people don’t seem to make enough of that hormone for one reason or another, and that as a result of that they have to supplement that hormone And that condition could be referred to as hypothyroidism We’re going to talk about all of these things, of course Peter would venture that there are tens of thousands of people listening to us right now that would identify as having hypothyroidism, and that are taking some form of thyroid replacement Our objective today is to make sense of this whole thing, because there are so many different ways that people think about how to replace that hormone, there are so many different that people think about how to diagnose the condition, and it seems that it is a much more complex endocrine situation than the other major systems we think about It doesn’t seem very difficult to understand what low testosterone is You have a very simple assay, you understand the symptoms quite well Replacing it is quite simple So, with that said, let’s go back to that meta-level, layer on as much detail as you’d like about the thyroid gland and what it’s doing That was a great introduction The thyroid gland, what it does is takes up iodine from the blood and uses that iodine to produce a hormone That’s quite interesting, quite unique We basically ingest iodine every day on our diet (for example, seafood is full of iodine), and we really need that iodine so that the thyroid can function ⇒ Without iodine there’s no thyroid hormone. Luckily, what we do is we supplement the kitchen salt with iodine. This is not something that we have to worry, if you have a reasonable amount of iodine every day, it will provide sufficient amounts to make the thyroid hormone The thyroid traps iodine, and through a series of complicated reactions it makes up the thyroid hormone It also stores a large amount of hormone ⇒ The thyroid is basically a large storage of thyroid hormone, mostly the pro-hormone, the inactive hormone, T4 T4 has 4 atoms of iodine The thyroid slowly secretes T4 into circulation on a daily basis so the blood has a storage of T4 ⇒ Now, T4 doesn’t do much, when we talk about the importance of thyroid hormone, it’s important for the brain, important for the heart, for the bones, we’re not talking about T4, we are talking about the other hormone, the active hormone, T3 It’s amazing that by just removing one atom of iodine from the T4, it now becomes a fully active hormone And why is that? Because cells, tissues, have receptors The receptors don’t like T4, they don’t bind T4 that much Receptors love T3, they bind T3 with high affinity Peter asks, “This is just purely a conformational difference or is it electrostatic?” It’s conformational, it doesn’t fit into the pocket of the receptor The pocket of the receptor has low affinity for T4 ‒ if you put a lot of T4 then yes, you’re going to get some action, but normally those are extremely high levels From an evolutionary perspective (not that we can ever know for sure), do you suspect that the reason for this is that it makes more sense to secrete an inactive pro-hormone that has a long half-life that can go everywhere and then each tissue can selectively make its determination of how much active hormone it needs? The evolutionary pressure is iodine deficiency The whole system evolved in a way to preserve iodine You see, the thyroid is full of thyroid hormone, it has 4 atoms of iodine, and then by removing one, it becomes active So, it’s preserving iodine as much as possible And what happens with that iodine that was removed? It’s taken back up again It’s all about preserving the iodine so that we don’t go into a situation that we don’t have enough iodine to produce that hormone Presumably when iodine is abundant, you can stockpile more T4 within the gland Absolutely, that’s right T3 is the active hormone Once you remove the atom of iodine, what happens is that the molecule becomes T3 (the active hormone), but then it has a short half-life ⇒ The contrast between T3 and T4 is dramatic: T4 has a half-life of about 8 days, T3 has a half-life of about 12 hours Once T3 is activated, it triggers its destruction It has a brief action It works potently, however it’s targeted for destruction (it’s just metabolized and cleared) And that tells you that this is a way the body has to regulate the action of thyroid hormone So, once it’s activated, let’s make sure it’s still active 12 hours later (you still need to have all that activity) It slowly activates, and if for any reason we have to stop activating, after you stop, shortly after the action of T3 will decrease That’s a way of limiting the amount of exposure of the tissues to the active thyroid hormone Peter has heard that there are different deiodinases Just for the listener, the deiodinases are enzymes that (as its name suggests) remove an iodine atom from T4 to [create] T3 Correct But there is a molecule called reverse T3, say a little bit about that and how it differs from T3 Reverse T3 is AT3, an alternative form of T3 It all depends on which iodine is removed from the molecule of T4 The molecule of T4 has two rings, the inner ring and the outer ring [shown in the figure below] If you remove the iodine from the outer ring, you make T3 [T3 is on the left side of the figure below] If you remove the iodine from the inner ring, you make reverse T3 [rT3 is on the right side of the figure below] Figure 1. Synthesis of T3 and reverse T3 (rT3) from T4, and synthesis of T2. Image credit: Wikipedia Peter asks, “Does it matter which one from the inner ring and which one from the outer ring?” No, it doesn’t Either one can do the trick And the amazing thing is that, whereas T3 is a super active molecule, reverse T3 is dead, it has less activity than T4 even You really need an astronomical amount of reverse T3 to do anything to the receptor (so, it’s really not active) The thyroid is constantly secreting T4 into the circulation The deiodinases will take T4 and either make T3 or reverse T3 And so, either activates or inactivates thyroid hormone And that constitutes an alternative pathway that can also be altered on a moment’s notice For example, all of a sudden you have all this T4 available, and let’s say the body wants to reduce the activation of thyroid hormone Instead of putting the T4 through the T3 pathway, T4 will preferentially go through the reverse T3 pathway and will be completely inactive How fasting alters thyroid hormones to conserve energy [A: 12:45, V: 11:08] A very extreme case, but a true scenario {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Warning label requirements on hormone replacement products are soon to be lifted",
      "content": "This past summer, the FDA took the first steps toward a potentially pivotal triumph for women’s health, convening an expert panel on estrogen products used for menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Specifically, the panel was tasked with evaluating the continued FDA requirement for estrogen products to be labeled with black box warnings regarding potential health risks, and the experts’ conclusions were unambiguous: the warning labels were not scientifically or clinically justified and should be removed to prevent unnecessary fear and to alleviate challenges that many face in accessing these medications. Shortly after the panel discussion took place, we published the piece below to share the news and provide context, as well as to express our support for the removal of the warning labels. Yet at the time, the panel’s recommended course of action was just that—a recommendation—and health officials did not indicate when, if ever, they might enact changes based on the panel consensus. But it seems the uncertainty may be over. This past week, the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services announced that they would lift the requirement for warning labels on HRT products,1 a change that is expected to come into effect within about six months. As such, we are re-publishing our earlier commentary on the debate surrounding HRT warnings to emphasize the scientific rationale for this change and its importance for women’s health. In the coming weeks, we will share an additional commentary on the potential downsides of this move—which have less to do with actual health risks of HRT than with overstatement of the potential benefits of such products—but in the meantime, we applaud the decision as a victory for women in achieving better health and quality of life. *** The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exists for the purpose of protecting the public by ensuring any products on the market are safe and efficacious. This, of course, is an extraordinarily worthwhile cause, but even the noblest of missions can occasionally lead to a few missteps, and on certain rare occasions, the FDA issues warnings and restrictions where they aren’t sufficiently justified by research. Such was the case in early 2003 when, in the wake of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the FDA issued a black box warning on estrogen products. The label warns that such products can increase risk of stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer, and the inclusion of this warning on estrogen products contributed substantially to the subsequent trend toward fear and avoidance of HRT among many providers and postmenopausal women. Now, more than two decades later, we have new hope that the 2003 decision might finally be reversed. Last week, in a panel discussion organized by FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, experts emphatically called for the removal of the warnings from HRT products. If the agency acts on the panel’s recommendation, the decision would constitute an enormous victory for women’s health. But what prompted the addition of the warning in the first place, and why has it now been re-opened for debate? The cause of the alarm When women experience menopause, levels of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone plummet, giving rise not only to classical vasomotor symptoms (e.g., hot flashes and night sweats) but also to many other negative effects on quality of life and physical health, such as losses in bone mineral density and muscle strength, changes in mood, and a decline in libido. Hormone replacement therapy, which involves supplementing the body’s low post-menopause levels with exogenous estrogen (and, for women with an intact uterus, exogenous progesterone), offers an effective means of attenuating these symptoms, and as a result, this approach steadily grew in popularity throughout the latter half of the the 20th century. But the trend came to an abrupt halt following the 2002 publication of results from a series of two landmark randomized trials — collectively known as the Women’s Health Initiative, or WHI — on the health effects of estrogen alone and of estrogen plus a synthetic form of progesterone.2 Prompted by earlier observational data suggesting that HRT might be cardioprotective, the two trials examined the relationship between the use of menopausal HRT and risks for various chronic diseases. Yet results from these studies failed to substantiate the alleged reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease with HRT. Even worse, the WHI investigators reported that the use of estrogen plus progesterone increased the incidence of breast cancer by 26% (95% CI: 0-59%) relative to placebo, as well as increasing risk of stroke by 41% (95% CI: 7-85%). The findings were widely publicized and ultimately led the FDA to require warning labels on any estrogen products regarding potential health risks. The impact was profound: within three years, the use of HRT had dropped by over 70% and has remained low ever since.3,4 But both the WHI results and the about-face reaction that they inspired have been mired in controversy from the very beginning — and rightly so. A closer look at the design and results of the WHI trials reveals several holes in the broad interpretation that HRT increases health risks. Flaws in the conclusions on breast cancer risk The greatest fear to arise from the WHI concerned the 26% higher breast cancer incidence in the HRT group relative to controls, yet the absolute numbers remained very low — this difference corresponded to about one additional case of breast cancer per 1,000 patient-years. Further, the two groups did not differ in the number of breast cancer deaths. So although women on HRT were slightly more likely to receive a breast cancer diagnosis over the average follow-up of 5.2 years, this didn’t equate to a higher risk of dying from breast cancer. Of course, cancer is a terrible disease that can cause great suffering even when it doesn’t result in death, so the increase in incidence itself would be a significant cause for concern — if it weren’t for the fact that even this finding is riddled with flaws. The discrepancy in risk disappeared altogether when considering only women with no HRT prior to the study (roughly 75% of the women in the study), and the apparent increase in risk in the full cohort (including women with and without prior HRT) wasn’t due to an unusually high incidence in those on HRT, but to an unusually low incidence in those on placebo who had previously used HRT. These problems alone would raise plenty of doubts about the WHI’s conclusions, but we also have compelling evidence that the increase in risk was specific to the outdated progestogen used by the WHI. The estrogen used in these trials was conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), and the progestogen (used only in the trial among women with intact uteruses) was medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) — the dominant forms of HRT at the time that the research began in the 1990s. Yet the apparent increase in breast cancer risk was only seen in the trial involving CEE plus MPA. Indeed, a subsequent analysis of WHI data on CEE alone versus placebo revealed that the CEE group had nearly a 20% lower risk of breast cancer incidence than the placebo group, as well as 40% reduction in breast cancer mortality relative to placebo by 20 years of follow-up.5 These results strongly suggest that MPA, and not estrogen, is responsible for any elevated risk observed in the WHI and that estrogen itself may even be protective. MPA is no longer used in HRT, having been replaced primarily by micronized progesterone. Thus, the WHI’s results are effectively irrelevant for modern medical practice, yet the FDA’s label nevertheless continues to flag all HRT products with this outdated (at best) warning about breast cancer.

The correlation makes some mechanistic sense, as the drop in estrogen that takes place during menopause tends to cause an increase in visceral fat accumulation, which can lead to other risk factors for CVD, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Yet the WHI’s reports indicated that HRT may do more harm than good from a cardiovascular perspective — the researchers observed increases in risk of stroke both in women on estrogen alone (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.07-1.85) and on estrogen plus progesterone (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.10-1.77). However, these numbers are a bit misleading from a statistical point of view. Each of the WHI trials involved assessment of several different outcomes, essentially constituting many unique tests within the same trial. While this may create a richer dataset, it also creates what’s known as a “multiple comparisons problem”: the more tests you run, the greater the probability of finding a result that’s statistically “significant” but does not actually represent a true association. This issue can be circumvented by statistical adjustments that effectively narrow the range over which a given result would be considered significant, and indeed, when the WHI researchers applied such a correction to their results, stroke risk was statistically equivalent between HRT and placebo groups. Even if we take the hazard ratios at face value, the observed discrepancy in risk again has questionable relevance for modern HRT usage. The oral CEE formulation used in the WHI does increase blood viscosity by a small degree, which might conceivably lead to more blood clots and strokes, but in modern practice, oral estrogens have largely been replaced by transdermal formulations, which do not raise blood viscosity and have accordingly been shown to have no negative impacts on risk of blood clots.6,7 Finally, when we expand our view to other metrics of cardiovascular health, HRT appears to have a net positive effect. While the WHI identified no significant benefits in this area, a 2015 Cochrane meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (including over 40,000 women) found that HRT reduced risk of CV events by 48% (RR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29-0.96) when initiated within 10 years of menopause (though this analysis showed no benefit for CVD when HRT was initiated >10 yrs postmenopause).8 The cost to quality of life In breaking down the specific numbers and subgroups from WHI data to expose the multitude of faults, it can perhaps be easy to lose sight of the true cost of those flawed conclusions. The fear (and FDA warning) that they inspired led an entire generation of women and their healthcare providers to eschew HRT, a treatment that has demonstrated the potential to drastically improve quality of life and physical health following menopause. The main reason women start HRT is to manage vasomotor symptoms, which, apart from being unpleasant on their own, can also negatively impact sleep, mood, and ability to engage in everyday activities. Numerous large trials and meta-analyses have consistently established HRT as the single most effective known treatment for these symptoms, with most women experiencing a symptom reduction of 60-90%.9 But the known benefits of HRT extend even beyond the realm of these classical menopausal symptoms. Estrogen also serves as an important inhibitor of bone resorption, which is why so many women experience substantial losses in bone mineral density after estrogen levels fall during menopause, which in turn increases risk of debilitating fractures. Replacing estrogen with HRT has been shown in many studies (including the WHI) to improve bone mineral density and reduce fracture risk,10,11 allowing women to maintain higher levels of physical function well beyond the menopausal transition. In the aftermath of the WHI publications, millions of women have been deprived of these positive effects. The faulty belief that potential risks with HRT outweigh potential benefits persists to this day, in large part due to the continued requirement for warning labels on HRT products. Thus, the true message of the recent FDA panel becomes clear: remove the black box label to stem the growing list of women who have suffered needlessly. Time for a change The FDA panel’s recommendation is no guarantee that the warning label will soon be abandoned. Many remain skeptical about HRT and have criticized the panel as trivializing potential health risks, yet those on this side of the debate tend to point to a lack of large-scale randomized trials using newer formulations rather than addressing the holes in the WHI data or pointing to any other evidence of cancer or stroke risk. In other words, this argument has no basis in evidence at all — they’re saying that, in the absence of rigorous evidence that HRT doesn’t raise breast cancer risk (despite general safety data), we have to assume that it does. Just like how there have never been any randomized trials investigating whether wearing blue jeans increases risk of colon cancer relative to wearing slacks, so we shouldn’t trivialize the risks of blue jeans and should avoid them as a general rule. See how little sense this makes? I encourage readers to listen to the panel’s arguments for yourselves, as the whole discussion is currently available on the FDA’s YouTube feed. To echo the words of recent podcast guest Dr. Rachel Rubin in her presentation as part of the FDA panel: “[the] box label that was blanketly placed on all products in 2003 has no data to support its existence … 22 years later (and consensus guidelines later), this deserves another look.” Indeed, between shaky evidence of risk and the emergence of newer and safer HRT formulations, it’s time we finally break down the barriers and fears that keep women from living healthy and full lives long after menopause.

      "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter breaks down the science of dietary fiber, moving beyond the blanket advice to “eat more fiber” to uncover what it actually does in the body and where its benefits are truly supported by evidence. He explains how different types of fiber—soluble, insoluble, viscous, and fermentable—affect digestion, satiety, weight management, and glycemic control, and compares their impact to other, more potent metabolic tools. Peter also examines how certain fibers influence lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk, evaluates the strength of evidence for fiber’s role in colorectal cancer prevention, and highlights why some individuals may not tolerate specific fibers well. The discussion concludes with practical guidance on moving past generic fiber targets toward a more strategic and personalized approach that maximizes the true benefits of fiber. f you’re not a subscriber and listening on a podcast player, you’ll only be able to hear a preview of the AMA.

Show Notes Why it’s time to re-examine the evidence behind dietary fiber recommendations [A: 2:00, V: 0:10] Introduction and framing of the topic Fiber is a topic that has generated many listener questions but has never been explored in depth on the podcast before. The episode will examine what fiber is, where it can and can’t be beneficial, and how to think about using it effectively. The discussion will cover major health claims associated with fiber, including its roles in: Satiety and weight management Glycemic control Cardiovascular health Colon cancer prevention The goal is to evaluate each of these claims and close with practical takeaways that listeners can apply to their daily routines. Why it’s worth dedicating an AMA to fiber It’s important to occasionally challenge assumptions that have become accepted as dogma. Fiber is widely considered universally beneficial, but much of that belief comes from association-based evidence rather than proven causation. The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for fiber is derived almost entirely from epidemiologic studies, which can show correlations but not causality. Epidemiologic data have sometimes led to incorrect dietary conclusions in the past, though not always, and thus shouldn’t be treated as definitive proof. Historically, fiber intake guidelines were often accepted because the perceived risk was low—if fiber is safe, then “what’s the harm in eating more?” The current conversation has become polarized, with two extreme views dominating public debate: The zero-fiber camp, often aligned with carnivore diets. The high-fiber camp, claiming large amounts (e.g., 50 grams per day) are essential for health. Most people fall between these extremes and can benefit from a balanced, evidence-based perspective. The purpose of this discussion is to take a closer look at the actual data so individuals can make informed choices about fiber intake. Even for health professionals, the optimal amount of fiber to consume remains uncertain, making this both a personal and professional inquiry.

      "title": "Focusing on what really matters for reducing your risk of death",
      "content": "Last weekend was Halloween, and anyone who took their kids trick-or-treating or attended a Halloween party probably glimpsed a few familiar costumes—Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, maybe a Scream or Saw mask here and there—but how many of you have ever seen someone dressed as an atherosclerotic plaque or a mass of cancerous cells? The latter will ultimately be the cause of death for most Americans, yet their constant, looming threat doesn’t carry quite the same gripping, terrible punch as murder or terrorism. Of course, horror films are fiction. But according to a recent article from Our World in Data, this discrepancy in emotional impact drives more than just the entertainment industry. It also trickles into mainstream news outlets, skewing coverage toward the sensational and away from the threats that actually account for most deaths in the U.S. A mismatch between mortality and media The article, “Does the news reflect what we die from” takes an investigative look at how the media’s attention aligns with reality.1 The authors examined the twelve leading causes of death in the U.S. in 2023, then added homicide, drug overdoses, and terrorism—topics that often dominate headlines despite their relatively small toll. Together, these categories accounted for roughly 76% of all U.S. deaths that year. To see how media coverage stacked up against actual causes of death, they performed an automated keyword search across stories from major national outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Fox News. Perhaps unsurprisingly, media coverage gravitated toward rare but emotionally charged causes of death—terrorism, homicide, and drug overdoses—while giving little space to the conditions that claim the most lives, like heart disease, cancer, metabolic diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases (their ubiquity and high death toll is exactly why I call them the “four horsemen of chronic disease”). Heart disease and cancer alone accounted for 56% of deaths in the sample, yet together appeared in only about 7% of media stories on mortality. At The New York Times, for instance, heart disease made up just 2.8% of related coverage despite accounting for nearly a third of deaths. Similar gaps appeared across the three outlets studied. By contrast, homicide accounted for less than 1% of deaths in the sample but dominated 42–52% of media stories. Terrorism—responsible for only 16 deaths—recieved up to 18% of coverage. A single figure from the article drives the point home (Figure 1): the gap between what’s the biggest threat and what’s reported is massive. (Note: Percentages reported in the figure reflect how coverage was distributed within the specific subset of causes examined, not across all deaths.) Figure 1: Media coverage vs. actual causes of death in the U.S. (from Our World in Data article)1 It’s no surprise that homicide and similar events tend to attract outsized coverage, so we can also assess the discrepancies between reported and actual mortality when narrowing the focus to just the twelve most common causes of death. Even then, the imbalance remains: accidents receive nearly as much coverage as heart disease and cancer combined, despite causing far fewer deaths, and deaths by other chronic conditions like dementia or metabolic disease barely registered at all. Of course, popular media is in the business of boosting readership and viewership, and rare and sensational events certainly make for more attention-grabbing stories than the common and constant threat of cardiovascular disease. But as the original article points out, people often rely on the news to stay informed. If someone were to make their health decisions based on media coverage alone, they might never leave home for fear of homicide or terrorism, while ignoring the far greater—and often modifiable—risks reflected in their lab results. If your goal is to stay genuinely informed about your health, it’s worth seeking information from sources designed for accuracy, not attention.

We reviewed everything we released that year—weekly emails, guest interviews, premium articles, “Ask Me Anything” podcast episodes, and special releases—to see how closely our focus aligned with real-world health risks. We followed a similar approach to the Our World in Data article, though our review was manual and more qualitative rather than automated. Specifically, we reviewed each piece of content for its main intents and focuses of discussion. This made some boundaries looser—for instance, grouping discussions of depression or PTSD under suicide—and others tighter, such as excluding pieces that mentioned cancer multiple times but only as an analogy. Overall, it was a good-faith manual assessment prioritizing accuracy. Going in, we expected to diverge sharply from mainstream media—after all, we don’t cover topics like terrorism or homicide. What we didn’t know was how our coverage would align with actual causes of death. When we compared our 2023 coverage on the 15 causes of death from the original article (the 12 leading causes plus homicide, drug overdose, and terrorism) with U.S. mortality data, we found a strong correspondence between what we emphasize and what most often drives mortality—especially heart disease, cancer, and other forms of chronic illness. Among the pieces that fell within this set of 15 causes, heart disease and cancer together accounted for 43% of our coverage, more closely mirroring their 56% share of U.S. deaths—and vastly exceeding the mere 7% they receive in mainstream media. Other chronic conditions, including Alzheimer’s, diabetes, kidney disease, and liver disease, made up 41% of our coverage, compared with about 14% of U.S. deaths within this set. That emphasis reflects a deliberate choice: many of these conditions develop over years and are at least partly modifiable through early detection, lifestyle changes, or preventive care. We dedicate more space to them because readers can actually do something about them—manage blood sugar, support cardiovascular health, or recognize early cognitive decline—unlike the catastrophic, often random events that dominate most news cycles. Accidents, COVID-19, influenza, pneumonia, suicide, and drug overdose together accounted for only a small fraction of our 2023 coverage within this set of causes, generally falling in the 1–3% range. Homicide and terrorism received no coverage at all, despite their dominance in mainstream news—a reflection of our commitment to prioritize enduring, health-relevant risks that we have the power to mitigate instead of horrific headlines about rare and typically unpredictable potential causes of death. You can see the full comparison in Figure 2 below. Rather than focus on the three outlets highlighted in the original article, we drew from the broader range of U.S. media sources included in the article’s extended methods. <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-30.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35753\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-30.png 1440w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-30-300x225.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-30-1024x768.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-30-768x576.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-30-400x300.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" />Figure 2: Comparison of our 2023 content with U.S. causes of death and media coverage, combining Our World in Data’s U.S. media coverage dataset and mortality statistics with our internal 2023 content review. Media percentages for categories with smaller shares—stroke, respiratory disease, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, kidney disease, liver failure, and flu/pneumonia—were not explicitly listed in the source dataset; we estimated these values from the relative size of their bands in the original figure, comprising about 8% of total coverage. Percentages may not sum to exactly 100% due to rounding. The bottom line Compared to the constant threat of cancer or heart attacks, homicide and terrorism are largely random events. Indeed, it’s precisely because they’re so unpredictable and unfamiliar (that is, as a day-to-day situation in which we might find ourselves) that they evoke such a strong emotional response, and this same emotional response is what drives marketable mainstream headlines (not to mention horror film franchises). But our goal is different from that of many media outlets. We aim to empower individuals with information that they can use to protect themselves from far more predictable—and far more likely—causes of death. Heart disease, cancer, and chronic metabolic or neurodegenerative diseases aren’t random events; they’re shaped by choices, environments, risk factors, and systems we can understand and improve. Prioritizing what’s most impactful for long-term health and lifespan often comes at a cost to us—reminding folks to exercise and keep up with cancer screenings doesn’t exactly make for great click-bait—but we began this enterprise as a humble attempt to help our audience improve their health, and that’s how we intend to continue it. Indeed, where our coverage does diverge from real mortality statistics, it is typically because we are choosing to focus on the most modifiable factors—changes you can make to shape your health. There’s nothing wrong with being drawn toward news articles on the latest mass shooting or terrorist attack, but just as we need to keep a grounding in reality when it comes to viewing fictional threats from slasher films or creature features, we need to keep in mind that the coverage distribution in mainstream media is likewise not representative of the real threats to your health. So by all means, continue keeping up-to-date with your favorite news outlets, but when it comes to your health, it’s important to supplement these sources with outlets that prioritize accuracy over attention.

Show Notes How sexual health influences physical health, emotional well-being, and relationships [A: 3:15, V: 0:11] This is a topic that on the surface might seem somewhat directed towards 50% of the population, but it’s safe to say it’s probably going to be directed towards a 100% of the population Sally is an OB-GYN, but her focus is not just on the standard OB-GYN things, but really around women’s sexual health Is that a fair assessment? From a hormonal and physiologic perspective, yes Peter was introduced to Sally through a mutual friend/patient who had listened to the Rachel Rubin podcast, and was super impressed by it and said, “You have got to speak with Sally.” Why would a podcast that focuses on health, longevity, all of these things that pertain to living longer and better? Why would sex be an important part of that discussion? Sally is having a hard time understanding how sex couldn’t be a part of that conversation First of all, this is a performance driven podcast, and so for the 50% of listeners who are male, if you want to improve your performance, Sally is going to give you facts and anatomical descriptions and describe some pathophysiology so that you can improve your performance Clearly sexual health is health, and when you look at your longevity levers and you think about your centenarian decathlon and what you want to do when you’re a hundred, for many people, this is on the list Sally wants to talk about how to structure your life and get you ready to do that She also thinks that there’s probably a small group of listeners similar to herself who always thought that The Drive was supposed to be about sex drive and that you just had a branding era when you named it the drive For those people as well, we’re finally going to talk about the drive that you actually care about, which is sex drive Peter wants to talk a little bit about the actual health component of this If you look at this through the lens of evolution, everybody clearly understands why sex is important and it’s the single most important thing in the propagation of our species Peter doesn’t just mean emotional and mental health where he thinks we could easily make that connection Is there any evidence whatsoever that a healthy sex life plays a direct role in health as it pertains to disease? Sally begins with 2 caveats 1 – This is an understudied, under-investigated area of our health Many of the studies that she will reference are not going to be robust in volume 2 – This is an incredibly heteronormative conversation For that reason, this is a data-driven podcast and Sally doesn’t have a lot of data on non-heteronormative Meaning [she will focus on] men who identify as men, having sex with women who identify as women So that should alarm you as well that we don’t have that data But that’s the space in which we have a data-rich zone, and that’s where we have to stay ⇒ The discrepancy when you look at sexual health is greatest among those 2 participants [men and women] When we look at sexual health and we try to make the argument that sexual health is a part of health, we can use Peter’s longevity framework If we start with sleep, there is great data We know that when you are sexually active with or without orgasm (just participation in a sexual activity), you switch from sympathetic to parasympathetic Post-orgasm, you have a great activation of the parasympathetic nervous system You release neurotransmitters, dopamine, oxytocin ‒ these are relaxing neurotransmitters When we study it either via diary or via great studies that look at resting heart rate, sleep latency (many of the measurements that we look to in terms of looking at sleep efficiency and quality) sleep subjectively and objectively improve with intercourse There was a great trial that looked at how women slept after an orgasm with themselves and they slept better And then it looked at women being intimate with a man and they slept better But women being intimate with a man and having an orgasm with that man synergistically improved their sleep You’re getting a dual benefit of that neuropharmacology that you’re releasing from your brain, improving your biometrics, but also there’s a connection and intimacy, a partnership that we know fosters better sleep There is limited data on cardiovascular health We know that sex can mimic a lot of the pathophysiology that we experienced during exercise There’s been arguments over the decades about is it low intensity, is it moderate intensity? (it depends on the couple) Studies have tried to measure the MET (or the metabolic equivalents) or essentially the energy output: for women, on average it’s around 6-7 metabolic units for every sexual encounter It’s about 60-70 calories used during sexual activity There’s a great study that compared this to walking slowly on a treadmill for the same amount of time They said that although sex was slightly lower in your energy export than walking on the treadmill Many of the participants reported that they had a much better time having sex than they did walking on the treadmill, and that’s something to consider We know sex is tapping into the body’s natural pharmacology, and that’s really interesting to think about from a relationship perspective Thinking about neurotransmitters and positive impact on mood and relationships Sally adds, “What I don’t want to say, what I don’t believe is that everyone has to have lots of sex and that there’s a number that we’re trying to target.” Is there a number needed to treat [NNT]? Is there a dose that we’re trying to go for? No, there’s no studies on that Realize that every person, every couple is different When you look at couples, Sally likes to look at who is having sex and by what frequency About 20% of couples ages 30-60, are having sex twice a week or more About 10% of couples are what we call never having sex, and that means in the last year About 70% of couples are having sex between those, meaning once a month, twice a month, around that number When you look at risk factor for divorce It’s the same across all numbers in the sense that it doesn’t matter how much sex you’re having You could never have sex, you could have lots of sex The divorce risk factor is what we call sexual desire discordance: where one partner wants more and one partner wants less Identifying that as the risk factor, Sally hopes it gives people affirmation or interest in the fact that if you want to work on it, she will help you, but not everyone has to This is not a podcast about everyone needs to go work on their sex drive, but if you do, she’ll go through the normal path of physiology and some additional tips and tricks to help you have a healthier sex life Peter’s takeaways 1 – The discordance of desire is a much bigger risk factor than anywhere you lie on the distribution of [sex frequency] 10% of people are basically asexual, 20% of couples are at twice a week or greater, and basically 2/3 of couples are somewhere in between 2 – Peter can’t resist coming back to the Centenarian Decathlon, and he’s glad Sally brought it up because it is one of the items on our list on the framework that we hand to patients When we ask patients to pick the 10 most important things that they want to be able to do in their marginal decade in the last decade of their life, and about ⅔ of our patients select having sex as one of those 10 activities That says something, given that we’re giving people a list of about 150 things to choose from, all of which are quite tempting To go back to the point about METs, if 7 METs is what is required energetically to have sex, we can convert that into VO2, and that translates to about a VO2 of 25 mL/kg/min Which means if you want to be able to have sex in your marginal decade, you need to have a VO2 max of probably about 30 mL/kg/min Why? Because it would be pretty tough to have sex if you were doing it right at your maximum VO2 ‒ that would be like asking you to do the fastest 800 meter run you’ve ever done and bring that level of exertion to sex You got to be a little bit below your limit While most adults can easily muster a VO2 max of 30 mL/kg/min, if you want to be able to achieve that in your 80s or 90s, when your 50, you need to be probably north of 45 or 50 “If I could just make one more shameless plug for having a high VO2 max, it’s going to allow you to be sexually active in the last decade of your life.”‒ Peter Attia Understanding the physiology of the female orgasm, sexual comfort and satisfaction, and the disparity between men and women [A: 12:45, V: 10:21] When it comes to understanding what an orgasm means for a man, it seems relatively straightforward in that it’s tied to ejaculation And while there are examples where a man can have a retrograde ejaculation due to exemplary use of medication and he can still have an orgasm, but you’re not actually witnessing an ejaculation With women, how is an orgasm actually defined? Is it a biochemical response in the brain? Is it a muscular contraction in the body? We are going to talk about “normal” things, and there are a lot of pathophysiology and deviations from what’s normal What’s normal in most women is a rhythmic contraction of the pelvic floor muscles There’s 4 stages to an orgasm {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Does eating more protein burn more calories?",
      "content": "When it comes to fat loss, most of us need all the help we can get. With the modern American lifestyle being largely sedentary and characterized by easy access to highly palatable, energy-dense foods, it can be very difficult to maintain the calorie deficit necessary to lose fat and keep it off. Whether or not a calorie deficit is achieved is determined by the difference between total energy in and total energy out. Assessing the “energy in” side of the equation is straightforward—add up the energy content of all food consumed. However, the “energy out” side is more complicated and much more difficult to accurately measure, as it varies by body composition, activity level, age, sex, and various other factors. One component of total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is the energy required to digest and metabolize food, termed the “thermic effect of food,” or “diet-induced thermogenesis” (DIT). DIT can account for ~10% of total energy expenditure, but some foods require greater energy input to digest and metabolize than others. Among macronutrients, protein is by far the least efficient source of energy—roughly 25% of the available energy in protein is expended just metabolizing it, which is more than double the amount of available energy required by carbohydrate, fat, or alcohol metabolism.1,2 This raises the question: can we leverage higher protein intakes to increase total energy expenditure enough to make a meaningful difference for fat loss? An analysis of dietary protein and energy expenditure Researchers Guarneiri et al.3 set out to answer this question in a recent meta-analysis of 52 randomized controlled trials on the effects of different macronutrient compositions on DIT and/or TDEE. In order for a study to qualify for inclusion, diet interventions needed to be isocaloric across groups, and high- and low-protein groups needed to differ in protein content by at least 5% of total energy intake (though in some studies, this difference was as large as 60%). The pooled subject population included 1,232 healthy and hyperinsulinemic individuals ranging from 14-73 years of age and BMIs from 18-43 (i.e., from slightly underweight to extreme obesity). A battery of statistical comparisons were performed to determine both the acute and chronic effects of high-protein meals and diets. Impacts of macronutrient composition were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD), a common statistical technique that allows researchers to compare results across studies using different metrics for the same outcome. An SMD of >0.2-0.5 can generally be interpreted as the intervention having a small effect size, whereas an SMD of 0.5-0.8 can be considered a moderate effect size, and an SMD of >0.8 indicates a large effect size. Diet-induced thermogenesis is substantially greater with high-protein meals Included studies that investigated the acute effects of a high-protein meal on DIT (over a window of 2–36 hours post-meal) and TDEE (over a window of 24–48 hours post-meal) revealed that higher-protein meals indeed resulted in higher DIT (SMD: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.26–0.65) and TDEE (SMD: 0.52; 95%CI: 0.30–0.73) compared to lower-protein meals. Effect sizes were similar for DIT and TDEE and persisted whether the meal consisted of a mix of animal and plant protein or strictly plant protein alone. But did these effects hold up in the context of a chronic high protein diet? In order to make a meaningful impact on weight loss, a high-protein diet will need to increase TDEE over a longer period of time than a few days. When looking at longer-term interventions (4 days–1 year), the authors indeed found that high-protein diets increased TDEE, though with a slightly smaller effect size than for acute high-protein meals (SMD: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.10–0.48). However, unlike the case with acute high-protein meals, DIT was not increased with high-protein diets (SMD: 0.10; 95% CI: -0.08–0.28), suggesting that the apparent increase in total energy expenditure was not attributable to the added energy cost of protein metabolism. Subanalyses again indicated that no difference existed between diets containing a mix of animal protein and plant protein and diets limited to plant protein alone (SMD: -0.15; 95%CI: -0.38–0.66). Of note, for both acute and chronic analyses, the investigators also observed that higher protein intake corresponded to a trend toward greater reliance on fat oxidation over carbohydrate oxidation for energy production. Overall, Guarneiri et al.’s results indicate that, assuming total calorie intake is equal, a diet higher in protein will result in greater energy expenditure than a diet lower in protein. But does this mean that the higher DIT from a high-protein diet will help with fat loss?

While we can be confident that a higher-protein meal consumes more energy during digestion and metabolism than a low-protein meal, we have to question whether the effect is large enough to really move the needle with respect to fat loss. One reason for skepticism can be found when we take a closer look at the high variability among studies included in the meta-analysis. Though the minimum criteria for study inclusion in this analysis was a 5% difference in percent of total energy from protein between high- and low-protein groups, this difference ranged up to 60% in some studies. Such a wide range is likely to have significantly affected results, as evidenced by a subanalysis in which the authors found that the overall differences in energy expenditure between high- and low-protein groups were driven by studies where the difference in protein between groups was at least 20%, whereas there were no differences in energy expenditure between groups in studies where the difference in protein intake was less than 20%. This seemingly minor detail has profound implications when it comes to translating these findings to everyday life. In the included studies, the low-protein diets generally consisted of around 10–15% of total calorie intake from protein. If we assume a standard diet of 2500 calories/day, this would correspond to 250–375 calories from protein, or about 62–94 grams of protein per day (~0.8–1.2 g/kg/day for someone weighing 75 kg). Most would find this level of protein intake (both as a total amount and as a proportion of overall calorie intake) fairly simple to achieve. But now let’s bump that intake up by 20%—the apparent minimum difference for an observable effect on energy balance. With protein accounting for 30-35% of total calorie intake, a 2500 calorie/day diet would include 750–875 calories from protein, or about 188–219 g/day (~2.5–2.9 g/kg/day for someone weighing 75 kg). That’s equivalent to eating four 8-oz steaks, three dozen eggs, or 25 cups of quinoa—every day. Even for those of us who make protein a high priority, this level of intake is extremely difficult to achieve at all, let alone without drastically increasing total calorie intake, too (which of course would be counterproductive if the goal is to achieve an energy deficit). In other words, the amount of protein intake that would be necessary to drive significant increases in energy expenditure exceeds amounts that are practical and realistic for most people. Dietary protein affects both sides of energy balance Even if we did see a significant difference in energy expenditure at more realistic ranges of protein intake, it’s important to keep in mind that the overall contribution of DIT to TDEE is fairly small. DIT from mixed diets ranges between 5-15% of total energy expenditure,4 with high alcohol or fat intake pushing DIT towards the lower end of that range and a high protein intake pushing it toward the higher end. Even if you moved from an extremely low-protein diet (~10% of total calories) to an extremely high-protein diet (~50% of total calories) this would at most equate to ~100-200 calories per day for a 2000 calories/day diet. Considering the amount of dietary restriction required to achieve this, and the fact that we’d rather dietary protein go to building and repairing body tissues than being broken down for energy, there are better options to achieve a calorie deficit. Indeed, it would be far easier for most individuals to cut calorie intake by 100-200 calories per day than to increase protein intake to account for 50% of total calories. But this isn’t to say that protein has no effect on weight loss. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that higher-protein diets are superior for producing sustained fat loss and maintaining lean mass.5,6 However, these findings are not necessarily mediated primarily by increased energy expenditure. As discussed in AMA #62, high-protein diets affect both sides of the energy balance equation. Protein has a substantially stronger anorexic effect than other macronutrients and can thus promote a reduction in energy consumption,7 and the relationship between protein intake and fat loss is likely more impacted by this satiating effect of dietary protein than by the relatively small increase in energy expenditure. (The analysis by Guarneiri et al. was restricted to studies using isocaloric diets and thus could not assess differences in satiety.) Make protein a priority Although Guarneiri et al.’s results revealed a small increase in DIT and TDEE with higher protein intake, they don’t support the notion that this effect constitutes a viable strategy for achieving an energy deficit. However, this study was not designed to evaluate protein’s established impacts on the other side of the energy balance equation—i.e., energy intake—and thus, we shouldn’t view the present findings as undermining the potential for high-protein diets to aid in weight loss. Yet in a larger sense, dietary protein’s potential role in the loss of fat mass represents only a relatively minor reason for prioritizing this macronutrient. The importance of high protein intake—substantially exceeding the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 0.8 g/kg of body weight per day—cannot be overstated, as it is vital for building and maintaining skeletal muscle, which in turn is as vital for health and longevity as it is for physical performance. Muscle hypertrophy is not maximized until protein intake approaches at least 1.6 g/kg/day, and for many, it continues to increase well beyond this level, particularly for those who are very active and have a large amount of muscle mass already.8,9 Indeed, although the metabolism of protein may consume more energy than the metabolism of other macronutrients, we don’t want to be metabolizing protein for fuel—we want it to go towards building and repairing muscle and other tissues, with only whatever’s leftover to be catabolized. So by all means, make protein intake a priority in your diet. There are numerous very good reasons to do so—a relatively small increase in energy expenditure just isn’t significant among them.

      "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter revisits the “proven, promising, fuzzy, noise, nonsense” scale and applies it to a variety of popular topics. He begins with a refresher on what each category represents before classifying a range of interventions based on the strength of their supporting evidence. The conversation spans three main areas: drugs for geroprotection (including GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, methylene blue, and telomere-lengthening supplements), the use of low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention, and strategies to improve muscle mass through optimal protein intake and follistatin gene therapy. This episode provides a clear, evidence-based overview for listeners seeking to understand where these popular health and longevity interventions stand on the spectrum of scientific credibility.

Show Notes A framework for evaluating scientific claims: proven, promising, fuzzy, noise, or nonsense [A: 1:30, V: 0:10] Overview & Structure of the Episode This AMA (Ask Me Anything) departs from typical deep-dive topics. Goal: summarize multiple health- and longevity-related interventions through a unified evaluative lens rather than exploring each in isolation. Framework: the “Five-Category Scale” — Proven, Promising, Fuzzy, Noise, Nonsense — first introduced in Episode 300 (May 2024). Purpose: Compare diverse claims apples-to-apples by level of evidentiary support. Give listeners quick, clear takeaways grounded in data strength. Revisit familiar concepts and introduce new ones under this schema. Topics to Be Evaluated Geroprotective / Longevity-Linked Drugs GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., Ozempic). SGLT2 inhibitors Emerging or Popularized Agents Methylene blue. Telomere-lengthening supplements. Preventive Pharmacology Low-dose aspirin and its evidence in cardiovascular-disease prevention. Muscle-Preserving / Building Interventions Protein intake optimization. Follistatin gene therapy and other muscle-mass-enhancing concepts. The Five-Category Evidence Scale Proven – “As close to truth as biology allows.” Supported by high-quality, consistent data replicated across studies. Comparable to well-established scientific claims. Note: in biology, nothing is ever literally proven (not like math with Q.E.D.). Promising – Data trend in a positive direction but may lack replication or completeness. “Looks good but not fully confirmed.” Fuzzy – Limited or inconsistent evidence. Some possible signal but weak or incomplete data quality. Noise – Essentially no meaningful or reproducible results. Not necessarily dismissible forever — could move up if stronger data emerge. Nonsense – Existing data refute the claim. As close to disproven as a biological hypothesis gets. Key Conceptual Notes These categories are fluid; interventions can migrate up or down with new evidence. The framework encourages critical thinking and ongoing reevaluation rather than fixed judgments. Intended outcome: help listeners allocate attention toward interventions most supported by evidence and away from distraction. Strong convictions, loosely held: the mindset that separates great scientists from the rest [A: 7:30, V: 6:30] “strong convictions, loosely held” In today’s culture—especially in fields like nutrition—people often anchor themselves to rigid beliefs (“camps”) and resist updating them despite new evidence This prompts Peter to elaborate on the idea of having “strong convictions, loosely held” See episode #103 and #202 Foundational Principle: “Strong convictions, loosely held” = maintain confidence in well-reasoned positions but stay willing to revise them when credible new evidence arises. Attribute of Great Scientists: Great scientists differ from good ones because they are not “married to being right”; they are “married to knowing what is right.” Their allegiance lies with truth, not ego or past beliefs. Willingness to evolve with data is the mark of intellectual integrity. Origin of the Phrase Peter first heard the expression from a friend who managed a hedge fund (now retired). The friend applied the principle in investing: You must hold strong convictions to justify putting real capital at risk. But convictions must be loosely held so you can pivot quickly when new information invalidates your thesis. In investing, rigidity is financially fatal—when you double down on wrong positions, you lose money and clients (“LPs”). Parallel Between Science and Investing {end of show notes preview}",

      "title": "A critical look at the lifespan-extending promise of psilocybin",
      "content": "“Magic mushrooms”—long used by Indigenous communities in ceremonial contexts and popularized during the psychedelic heyday of the 1960s—are once again entering the mainstream, in large part for the potential clinical applications of their psychoactive component, psilocybin. Though scientific interest has thus far mainly focused on the use of psilocybin for treating psychiatric conditions like anxiety and depression, a recent study made headlines for findings that hinted at a role for psilocybin in aging-related processes. Specifically, authors Kato et. al. present data from human cells and aging mice that suggest psilocybin could potentially act as a lifespan-extending drug.1 Why psilocybin for aging? The idea that psychedelic mushrooms can extend lifespan may seem like the sci-fi daydream of modern-day hippies, but it’s not without some level of scientific basis. Psilocybin—which is converted to the bioactive molecule psilocin in the body—has shown promising results in treating depression and anxiety through psilocin’s ability to bind to serotonin receptors (especially the 5-HT2A receptor), leading to alterations in mood, perception, and sense of self.2 Depression and anxiety are themselves thought to accelerate a number of aging processes, which has led to the theory that psilocybin might therefore slow aging by reducing psychological stress. One of the aging processes believed to be exacerbated by psychological stress is telomere attrition. As we discuss in greater depth in AMA #76 (to be released tomorrow), telomeres are the protective DNA caps at the end of chromosomes and shorten each time a cell divides. Eventually, telomere shortening pushes cells into senescence, a hallmark of aging in which cells are still alive but are no longer growing and dividing (sometimes referred to as “zombie cells”), and the build-up of such cells can promote inflammation. Because psychological stress may accelerate telomere attrition, the “psilocybin-telomere hypothesis” therefore posits that psilocybin could preserve telomeres through a reduction of psychologic stress, and thus might slow aging. But the serotonin receptors activated by psilocin aren’t just present in the brain; they’re scattered throughout the body, including in immune cells and the gut. This raises the possibility that psilocybin might have direct systemic effects in addition to potentially influencing aging through its psychological effects. Oxidative stress—a state in which the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) outpaces the body’s ability to neutralize them—also promotes tissue damage and is a characteristic feature of aging, and it has been suggested that psilocin can reduce the release of ROS through activation of the 5-HT2A receptor.3 Oxidative stress can also lead to accelerated telomere attrition and chronic inflammation, so psilocybin-induced ROS reduction may affect aging through multiple mechanisms. Put together, we see various pathways through which psilocybin has been hypothesized to slow aging, mainly resting on the slowing of telomere attrition via reduction in both psychological stress and oxidative stress. However, it is also a fragile hypothesis that relies on a chain of correlations and theoretical mechanistic connections. Each link is a leap of faith needing experimental validation and explanation of causal direction, prompting the Kato et. al. to investigate more deeply. About the study To put the psilocybin–telomere hypothesis to the test, the authors primarily relied on experiments conducted with human cells (lung fibroblasts) grown in a laboratory, supplemented by an additional proof-of-concept experiment in living, aged mice. For cell culture experiments, human cells were treated with psilocin or vehicle (controls) and allowed to continue dividing until they reached a state of senescence, such that the number of divisions a cell underwent before reaching senescence could be regarded as the replicative “lifespan” of the cell. Compared to control cells, cells treated with psilocin at a concentration of 10 μM displayed an extension of cellular lifespan of 29%, while an even greater effect was observed in cells treated with a tenfold higher dose—a 57% extension relative to controls. These findings were further validated by reductions in cellular markers of cell cycle arrest (which slow or halt cell growth and division) and increased markers of proliferation in treated cells. Taken together, these results point to delays in cellular senescence when psilocin is applied directly to human cells. Psilocin-treated cells also produced less ROS and exhibited longer telomeres. Across a wide range of concentrations (0.01 to 100 μM), psilocin led to dose-dependent reductions in ROS production in aged cells (60–63 days in culture) compared with controls, with the highest doses reaching a level of ROS at or below that of younger cells (0–4 days in culture). Likewise, while telomere length declined in control cells as they aged, psilocin-treated cells preserved their telomere length, and since these were cultured cells and thus not subject to the effects of psychological stress, we can conclude that psilocin can indeed influence telomere length through direct effects on peripheral cells—whether through the reduced ROS production or through a different, unknown mechanism. But the experiment that caused the study to make headlines was a proof-of-concept survival experiment in 30 female mice. The authors treated these mice with oral psilocybin or vehicle once per month starting at 19 months old (roughly equivalent to a 60- to 65-year-old human). After 10 months of treatment, about 80% of the psilocybin group was still alive, compared with only 50% of controls. The psilocybin treated mice also appeared healthier, with darker, fuller coats and fewer patchy, gray areas. Thus, in human cells, psilocin appeared to slow cellular aging across multiple related hallmarks—reduced senescence, lower oxidative stress, and preserved telomeres. In living animals, psilocybin increased the survival rate of older animals and improved visual signs of aging.

While it’s true that telomeres shorten with repeated cell divisions (which is partially offset by enzymes that rebuild telomeres), there’s little evidence that telomere length reliably predicts lifespan or that slowing the process of telomere attrition might enhance lifespan. Across species, telomere length has no consistent relationship to longevity: mice, for example, have much longer telomeres than humans but live only a few years. Even correlations with chronological age are weak. A 2021 meta-analysis of telomere length in 98 species found only a very modest inverse relationship with age, and only in adults.4 In juveniles, there was no correlation at all, and the analysis didn’t even find a clear difference in telomere length between adults and juveniles. In other words, telomere length may reflect how many times a cell has divided, but it is not a reliable marker of aging. What to make of apparent lifespan effects? Despite the shaky premise that preserving telomere length will extend lifespan, the data from this study did indeed show that more animals survived to the end of the experiment if they were given psilocybin instead of placebo—an observation that is hard to ignore. And there are certainly plenty of other paths through which psilocybin might accomplish such an effect, independent of telomeres. However, it’s worth noting that this experiment lacked a certain degree of rigor and completeness typically expected for lifespan extension tests. For one thing, the researchers imposed a forced endpoint. Once 50% of the control animals died, they stopped the study. That means we don’t know the true median lifespan of the psilocybin group (at what age 50% of those animals had died), nor do we know whether the treatment extended maximum lifespan (how long the longest-lived animals survived). Without those numbers, the claim that psilocybin is a bona fide lifespan-extending drug is premature at best. What the study really shows is not that psilocybin pushed the ceiling of aging outward, but simply that fewer treated mice died over the treatment period under the study’s conditions—an important distinction when we’re talking about interventions that claim to slow aging. But let’s say psilocybin truly did extend lifespan in these mice—we still must leap hurdles related to translating these results to humans. The most obvious is dosing. The animals were given quite large amounts of psilocybin, far beyond what most humans would find tolerable. At 15 mg/kg, the monthly dose given to these mice translates (via standard allometric scaling to account for differences in metabolism) to about 1.2 mg/kg in humans—roughly 72 mg for a 60 kg person. For context, current therapeutic trials of psilocybin typically use about 25 mg, and 50 mg is considered a “hero dose” in psychedelic communities. In other words, the mouse regimen would amount to taking a hero dose once a month, every month, for years on end. Why did they dose the animals at such high amounts? The researchers started by correcting for differences in metabolism using allometric scaling, then added a second adjustment based on the half-life of the drug seen in mice compared to in humans—essentially correcting twice for the same factor of faster drug metabolism in mice. This approach may be defensible for proof-of-principle tests in which the goal is to maximize the likelihood of seeing an effect, but it raises obvious questions about translation, as the regimen used here is unlikely to map onto any realistic scenario for human use. Not proof, but not nothing Despite its methodological limitations and shaky rationale, this study does serve an important purpose as exploratory research—raising interesting questions for further investigation. First, what’s the true mechanism at play? By acting on 5-HT2A receptors, psilocybin alters stress reactivity and may reduce systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Might this be a more important mechanism than slowing telomere shortening? Or perhaps the lifespan effect in mice has less to do with the apparent cell-autonomous effects on ROS and instead relates more to the psychological effects of buffering stress, which leads to a critical question: must the psychological effects be experienced for the physiological benefits to emerge? Could a non-hallucinogenic analog produce the same downstream changes without the psychedelic trip? Second, how does psilocybin stack up against a “gold standard” geroprotector like rapamycin? Rapamycin has extended both median and maximum lifespan across sexes, strains, and labs, with clear functional benefits along the way. Psilocybin, by contrast, has one small, unreplicated study, in a single sex, with a forced endpoint. For now, it’s not in the same league—but could future experiments put it there? Perhaps if psilocybin is subjected to the rigorous testing of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), we may eventually have reason to put more faith in its alleged lifespan enhancement effects. Finally, what about functional outcomes? Survival curves and coat color only scratch the surface of aging biology. Does psilocybin help to preserve lean mass and reduce frailty in older animals? What about improvements in cognitive function, or maintenance of immune competence? Without these types of readouts, we’re left guessing whether the mice simply lived longer—or whether they actually lived better. The bottom line Studies on psilocybin inevitably spark debate, probably because it has been deemed a Schedule I substance (classified as having “high abuse potential” and “no accepted medical use,” though both of these classifications have come into serious question). As such, some dismiss the results outright, while others hail them as heralding a new era for psychoactive medicine. The reality, as always, is more nuanced. This study is intriguing because its signals all point in the “right” direction: longer-lived cells in vitro, reduced oxidative stress, preserved telomeres (whether or not that means anything), and greater survival in aged mice. But pointing in the right direction is not the same as proof. The mouse experiment was not designed to test lifespan rigorously, the telomere rationale is shaky, and the dosing strategy raises obvious translational challenges. Still, it opens up worthwhile lines of inquiry. If psilocybin’s effects are really driven by stress buffering and serotonergic signaling, that could add an important dimension to how we think about mental health and aging. The question now is whether these early, suggestive findings will hold up under the weight of more careful experiments. Until then, psilocybin remains an exciting molecule with therapeutic promise—but not yet a proven player in the longevity space.

      "content": "Rhonda Patrick is a scientist, health educator, and host of the FoundMyFitness podcast whose work explores the intersection of nutrition, aging, and disease prevention. In this episode, Rhonda joins Peter for part two of his deep dive on protein, continuing last week’s discussion with David Allison and expanding the conversation to include creatine supplementation and sauna use. She discusses why the current RDA for protein is insufficient, how much more is needed to maintain muscle mass and prevent frailty, how activity level and aging influence protein requirements through mechanisms such as anabolic resistance, and how to determine optimal protein intake. The conversation also covers creatine’s proven effects on strength, endurance, and performance; its overlooked benefits for cognition and brain health; and the optimal dosing for different populations. Rhonda closes with the science behind sauna use, including its cardiovascular and cognitive benefits, the role of heat shock proteins, and practical guidance on temperature and duration.

Show Notes Why the current protein RDA is too low, and why maintaining sufficient amino acid intake is vital for muscle preservation and health [A: 3:30, V: 0:11] Protein is an important topic Rhonda and Peter have probably talked to all the world’s experts on protein [Explore more at PeterAttia—MD and FoundMyFitness] They were chatting a moment about about the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein, and really what it should be called is “the minimum daily allowance” Recommended almost sounds like optimal The RDA is 0.8 g of protein per kg of body weight People confuse the RDA with the optimal amount of protein They have both talked to countless experts about this Stu Phillips being one [episode #76 of FoundMyFitness] People can start off by reading Stu Phillips’ Perspective Protein Requirements and Optimal Intakes in Aging: Are we ready to recommend more than the recommended daily allowance? There are several other publications on this topic, if you have the time and the willingness to go into the scientific literature Read or listen to The Drive or listen to FoundMyFitness When the actual experts talk about the protein RDA, what you will learn is that a lot of the studies that were done to determine this RDA were flawed They were called nitrogen balance studies They were flawed for many reasons, and Rhonda doesn’t want to get into all the technical reasons What they are doing is measuring the amount of nitrogen that is excreted in urine after you are metabolizing protein The most important flaw is that different types of foods that have protein in them have different nitrogen to protein ratios Nitrogen balance studies are collecting urine, and that it’s an incomplete collection When you pee in one of those cups, you don’t get all the urine And we lose nitrogen through other means Essentially the signal-to-noise ratio is pretty low “Ultimately, what countless experts have now agreed upon is that the protein for the RDA has been underestimated because of those reasons.”‒ Rhonda Patrick New studies have been done These have been stable isotope studies The major isotope that’s used is the L-1,13-carbon labeled phenylalanine These studies take a small cohort of people, give them a known amount of protein with that isotope tracer, and then that tracer is oxidized when it’s metabolized and that’s measured through breath (the oxidation of phenylalanine). And so now you’re getting a quantification that’s much more accurate in terms of your protein steady state and turnover Rhonda explains, “The whole point here is that you’re trying to figure out the minimal amount of protein you need to take in every day to make sure that you’re not in a negative protein balance.” ⇒ That’s important because we don’t store amino acids like we store fatty acids as triglycerides or we store glucose as glycogen The major source of our amino acid storage tank (so to speak) is our muscle skeletal muscle tissue And you don’t want to be pulling from that skeletal muscle tissue to get amino acids every day Why do we need amino acids every day? Because everything in our body requires proteins Proteins are doing all the work in our body Proteins are made up of amino acids, and so we have to be giving ourselves a daily intake of amino acids to make sure we’re able to do all those functions Peter wants to state that again because there’s a very important and fundamental point here that is glossed over when we talk about it because we take it for granted We can store fat in unlimited quantities ‒ so if you deprive a person of fat calories for a period of time, they have a long reservoir that they can dig into We can store carbohydrates Now we can’t store them quite as much because we only have so much glycogen we can store in the muscle and in the liver But when we break down fat, we keep making the substrate to actually make glucose [gluconeogenesis] So we get into a nice little rhythm The only place that an amino acid sits in residence in our body is in the muscle ⇒ Therefore, if we even get near the edge where we are not getting sufficient intake of amino acids, we don’t have a buffer, we don’t have a rainy day fund that we can dip into, we immediately start to catabolize or break down muscle Peter doesn’t think we have to make the case that that’s a bad idea “There is not really a single scenario I can think of that is clinically relevant where it would be desirable to give up muscle mass.”‒ Peter Attia Maybe if you’re Mr. Olympia, you can sacrifice muscle mass But for you and me, and everybody listening to us ‒ giving up muscle mass because we are falling short on our protein intake would be a strategic error and an unforced error Rhonda agrees and adds, “For short-term and long-term health. I think that’s pretty clear and that’s where this RDA not being enough is a very important point.” The case for raising the protein RDA by at least 50% [A: 9:45, V: 7:12] There have been multiple isotope tracer studies showing that 1-2 g of protein per kg of body weight is needed to prevent negative protein balance in adults This is quite a bit more than the RDA of 0.8 g/kg (50% more) Most of the isotope tracer studies show 30-50% more protein intake is required [Reviewed in 2010 and 2018] That’s really important because if we look at the actual protein intakes of adults, these are nutritional surveys that are done: they’re all flawed We all know the flaws of questionnaires Let’s just talk about what we think people are actually taking in {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Research Worth Sharing: October 2025 Edition",
      "content": "Creatine & Cognition in Menopausal and Perimenopausal Women Why we are interested: Menopause and perimenopause are often accompanied by declines in muscle mass, metabolic health, and cognitive function. In the recently published CONCRET-MENOPA randomized controlled trial, creatine supplementation was explored as a potential way to ameliorate some of these symptoms. 1 What they showed: The investigators split 36 healthy, menopausal and perimenopausal women into 4 groups: low-dose creatine hydrochloride (750 mg/day), medium-dose creatine hydrochloride (1,500 mg/day), creatine hydrochloride plus creatine ethyl ester (800 mg/day), or placebo. A variety of functional tests and biomarkers were measured before and after the 8-week intervention, and results revealed that, compared to placebo, supplementation with medium-dose creatine hydrochloride had statistically significant—albeit modest—effects on enhancing reaction times, favorable modulating serum lipid profiles, and increasing frontal brain creatine levels. There was also a potential benefit of creatine in reducing mood swings, but this effect did not reach statistical significance. Notably, however, there were no significant effects on most menopausal symptoms including fatigue and exercise tolerance. A great deal of research has indicated that creatine may have numerous benefits, and women generally have lower endogenous stores of creatine than men, such that it is not unreasonable to consider creatine supplementation. While this small study was largely negative, it still provides some additional evidence that creatine supplementation could be helpful for some middle-aged women. The doses used in the study were quite small, and so it may also have been that higher doses are needed to see the full benefits. Further research will be required to elucidate the exact nature of the benefits of creatine, the difference between alternative forms of creatine, and optimal dosing. doi: 10.1080/27697061.2025.2551184 Probiotics and synbiotics reduce diabetes-associated inflammation Why we are interested: Evidence is continually emerging regarding the microbiome’s potential to impact human health in various ways. In parallel, research is also uncovering ways in which simple interventions designed to improve the health of the microbiome might therefore offer benefits for the treatment and prevention of certain diseases. Such interventions include probiotics (which contain live bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria) and synbiotics (the combination of a probiotic with a prebiotic—i.e., indigestible fiber and other nutrients that serve as food for gut bacteria and supports their growth), and one area where they have gained particular attention is in the context of systemic inflammation that often accompanies metabolic disease. What they showed: This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed data from 22 randomized trials comprising a total of 1321 individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D), of which 683 individuals had received a pro- or synbiotic intervention and 628 had served as controls.2 The authors reported that supplementation with probiotics and synbiotics significantly reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, including C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and TNF-α. The strongest effects were seen in patients with greater burden of these cytokines and in studies involving longer duration of supplementation (≥12 weeks). Using the standard GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) framework, the authors reported that the quality of evidence was moderate for both CRP and TNF-α and high for IL-6, despite some inconsistency in results across trials. This inconsistency could stem from the fact that each study included in this analysis used different probiotics/synbiotics, containing different microbes at different doses. However, the finding of any consistent trend using such a variety of supplements is noteworthy and points to promising benefits of probiotics and synbiotics for reducing inflammation associated with diabetes and prediabetes when administered for at least 12 weeks. doi: 10.1016/j.advnut.2025.100526 Frailty correlates with length of hospital stays and risk of mortality Why we are interested: We often emphasize the importance of strength for longevity, as it’s well known that frailty in old age is associated with poorer health outcomes and increased mortality. But while we have often focused those discussions on the devastating effects that frailty—and consequent falls and fractures—can have on those in their 70s, 80s, or beyond, this recent study reminded us that the dangers of frailty are not limited to old age.3 What they showed: This study analyzed over 650,000 emergency hospital admissions for individuals between the ages of 18-74, randomly sampling all admissions during an 8-year period in England. Patients were assigned a Hospital Frailty Risk Scores (HFRS) between zero (no frailty risk) and 173.2 based on several frailty-related diagnostic codes, and scores were binned as zero (the reference group), low, intermediate, and high risk. Results showed statistically significant associations between frailty risk and length of hospital stay, hospital costs, and hospital mortality, and while the magnitude of the correlations increased with age, they remained significant even in the youngest age group studied (ages 18-24). For example, those aged 18-24 with an HFRS in the “high” category remained in the hospital for an average of 4.5 days longer than those with an HFRS of zero (95% CI: 3.8–5.3 days) and were 0.3% more likely to die while in the hospital (95% CI: 0.16–0.48). For comparison, adults in the 45-54 age group with high HFRS stayed in the hospital 6.2 days longer than their peers with HFRS of zero and had a 0.8% higher likelihood of in-hospital mortality, while those in the 85-94 age group stayed in the hospital 15.3 days longer than their peers with a zero HFRS and had a 2.2% higher risk of in-hospital mortality. These findings support the idea that a frail patient of any age has worse outcomes when admitted to the emergency room. doi:10.1016/j.lanhl.2025.100740 Our research team spends hundreds of hours each month vetting studies and distilling dense literature to deliver evidence-informed insights on health and longevity.

As we’ve detailed in a past premium article, observational and animal studies have suggested that this drug could have the potential to improve longevity even in healthy populations. However, recent research and re-analysis has called into question many of the early findings, and much of the excitement has turned into uncertainty. What they showed: The authors of this review evaluated the current literature on metformin and explored the various sources of weakness in the metformin-as-longevity-agent story.4 Exciting research in various experimental models (e.g., invertebrates and rodents) fueled early interest, but more recent studies, including those done as part of the National Institute on Aging’s Intervention Testing Program (ITP), have not shown replicable lifespan benefits in mice. Human evidence is likewise underwhelming. While some research seemed to suggest that people with diabetes taking metformin actually lived longer than people without diabetes, reassessment of this evidence indicated that various types of confounding, selection effects, and biases were likely affecting the results, such that it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the epidemiological data. Similarly disappointing are the randomized controlled trials that have been attempted: they have been few, small, and with largely ambiguous or negative results. Metformin remains an intriguing molecule, and one that continues to have an important role in treating diabetes and other types of metabolic dysfunction. The initial promise of metformin as a geroprotective agent for the general population, though, has mostly failed to materialize. It is possible that future large-scale randomized controlled trials will show clear positive results, but for now the data are not convincing in terms of its use in otherwise healthy people. doi: 10.1016/j.arr.2025.102817 Traditional and novel targets for lipid-lowering medications Why we are interested: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, despite the existence of several medications that are effective in reducing risk by lowering circulating levels of atherogenic lipoproteins (mainly low-density lipoproteins, or LDLs). Various classes of these lipid-lowering drugs can have additive effects and differ in side effect profiles, and thus, the availability of numerous options increases the likelihood that any given patient will be able to achieve effective lipid management in a manner that is safe and well tolerated. These drugs come up often on the podcast, but their variety and mechanisms by which they act can be difficult to keep straight. This review—published in the European Heart Journal last month—serves as an excellent reference for understanding both established lipid-lowering medications and those that may be on the horizon.5 What they showed: As this was strictly a review, the information contained within it has all been published previously. However, the value of this article lies in the synthesis and organization of the broad field of research on lipid-lowering drugs into a single resource, complete with tables and figures that clearly delineate the various classes of such medications and how they function. In addition to providing this information for drugs that are already in use, the authors also discuss new drugs that have reached the later stages of the development pipeline, many of which target elements of lipid metabolism that are distinct from the targets of existing medications. Thus, this paper serves as a guide not only for the current landscape of lipid-lowering drugs, but also for the likely future of these therapies—topics which are sure to come up time and again throughout our content. doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf606 For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama References 1.

      "title": "#368 ‒ The protein debate: optimal intake, limitations of the RDA, whether high-protein intake is harmful, and how to think about processed foods | David Allison, Ph.D.",
      "content": "David Allison is a world-renowned scientist and award-winning scientific writer who has spent more than two decades at the forefront of obesity research. In this episode, David joins for his third appearance on The Drive to bring clarity to one of the most contentious topics in modern nutrition—protein. He explores the historical pattern of demonizing macronutrients, the origins and limitations of the RDA for protein, and what the evidence really says about higher protein intake, muscle protein synthesis, and whether concerns about harm are supported by actual data. He also discusses the challenges of conducting rigorous nutrition studies, including the limits of epidemiology and crossover designs, as well as conflicts of interest in nutrition science and why transparency around data, methods, and logic matter more than funding sources. The episode closes with a discussion on processed and ultra-processed foods, the public health challenges of tackling obesity, and whether future solutions may depend more on drugs like GLP-1 agonists or broader societal changes. This is part one of a two-part deep dive on protein, setting the stage for next week’s conversation with Rhonda Patrick.

Show Notes The cyclical pattern of demonizing different macronutrients in nutrition and why protein has recently become the latest target of controversy [A: 3:15, V: 0:10] David just got a great new gig at the Children’s Nutrition Research Center in Houston, Texas and Baylor College of Medicine in Texas Children’s Hospital We’re going to start by talking about something that Peter doesn’t want to talk about (he’s sick and tired of talking about it), but this is a topic that has gone from being pretty straightforward to somewhat contentious He apologizes in advance to all the listeners, they’re probably sick and tired of hearing about this He will do his best to refrain from speculating on the reasons why it has become contentious Let’s try to dive into the arguments around the macronutrient that is more in the crosshairs than any other today, which is protein That’s interesting when you consider the arc of David’s career It was certainly easy to understand how people demonized fat and then they demonized carbs Here we are today, come in full circle, we’re demonizing protein Where do you place the demonization of protein in the arc of the historical lens of nutrition? It shows many things, but at some level, it’s almost perfectly predictable, which is: we all eat, we eat every day Eating is part of our sustenance, but it’s part of culture, family, certainly part of economics, identity, social class, religion, and so on So, it’s fun to talk about and there’s lots of motivations, motivations people recognize and motivations they may not recognize That leads always to this attention on it That attention drives a big economic engine of food sales ‒ there’s lots of interest in this and lots of stakes in this (if you’ll pardon the pun) People shift, and it’s not even just the macronutrients This week, it’s seed oils, and next week, it’s phytoestrogens and soybean feminizing youth “It’s one thing after another where people look for the villains and the heroes and the angels and the demons in food.”‒ David Allison There are only 3 macronutrients, so they keep looping around Protein has become in the last few years almost a fever pitch of enthusiasm and excitement from one part of the community, and it’s driving sales and it’s driving behavior Some people like David are having fun with it There’s always that group that sees other people having fun or making money and heaven forbid doing something that might be seen as the easy way out or the contrived or constructed way out as opposed to the so-called natural way out of doing something and then that upsets them, that offends them You’re not being prudent, you’re not taking the natural course, you’re not taking the old-fashioned course, you’re having too much fun, you’re trying too hard to achieve big things (we don’t like that) So, we’re going to try to pooh-pooh it or shut it down or minimize it. That’s where David thinks things are Peter presumes at some point this will no longer be relevant and no one will talk about it and we’ll move back to fats being the bad thing Although, we’re there with seed oils The origin and limits of the protein RDA: from survival thresholds to modern optimization [A: 6:30, V: 4:03] The debate around the RDA and recommendation of 0.8 g of protein per kg of body weight Tell folks a little bit about where that came from? To put that in perspective, Peter weighs 180 lbs, that’s probably 82 kg According to the RDA he should be eating 60-65 g of protein It’s the middle of the day and he has had 60 g of protein already, so he could basically stop eating protein for the rest of the day right? Yeah, some people would say that A more active proponent of the importance of not only greater amounts of protein but particular types and distributions would be somebody like Don Layman He might say, “Peter, you actually need to be eating protein at least three or four times a day.” [he was the guest in episode #224] Peter adds that he ate that 60 g of protein in 1 sitting ⇒ David clarifies that you probably want to hit about 30 g of protein at each sitting He emphasizes the word “about” It’s not like there’s some mathematical proof that there’s some hard threshold Certainly not for Peter who is 20% bigger than David, that Peter’s hard threshold would be the same as David’s hard threshold But in the neighborhood of 30 g of protein [Studies by Luc van Loon show significant increase in muscle protein synthesis after consuming 30 or more grams of protein after exercise, shown in the figure below] Figure 1. Muscle protein synthesis after consuming protein post-exercise. Image credit: American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2020 David’s takeaway: right off the bat, if you follow that advice, you’d need to be having double [the RDA] amount of protein and you’d have to have it distributed differently {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Artificially sweetened beverages for metabolic health: motivation matters",
      "content": "Rates of obesity and metabolic disease have risen sharply over the last 50 years or so, and there’s no question that the causes of this ongoing trend are numerous and multifaceted. While many of the commonly cited contributors—such as decreasing costs of food production and transportation—may be outside of our power to change, others can be avoided entirely through personal lifestyle decisions. Take, for instance, the overconsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, which can add hundreds of empty calories to daily energy intake. Many individuals attempt to avoid these calories by opting for “diet” versions of the same beverages—swapping real sugar with low- or no-calorie sweeteners. Still, despite widespread recognition that sugary drinks can contribute to weight gain and metabolic dysregulation, the question of whether switching to diet versions can lead to meaningful weight loss or reductions in risk of obesity remains controversial. I touched on this topic in a recent “Ask Me Anything” episode on sugar and sugar substitutes, noting how factors such as the type of sugar substitute may alter the net impacts on metabolic health. Yet there is one variable that did not receive sufficient attention as part of that discussion: motivation. Conflicting evidence on metabolic effects As we explored in depth in a past premium article, studies to date on the effects of sugar versus sugar substitutes on metabolic health and body weight seem to tell different stories depending on where you look. If we only considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs)—regarded as the “gold standard” for assessing the effects of a given intervention in humans—consumption of artificially sweetened beverages (ASB) appears to have neutral to slightly positive benefits for body weight and body composition relative to sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB). A number of meta-analyses of such studies have shown that individuals randomized to ASB show reductions in body weight equivalent to about 2 lbs, give or take about 0.5 lbs.1–3 This level of weight loss is questionable in terms of clinical significance, but the results at least indicate that ASB have no negative effect on body weight, even if they don’t move the needle substantially in a positive direction. However, this conclusion seems less solid when we turn to data from animal studies and epidemiology. Investigations in rats have found that animals given food or water sweetened with artificial sweeteners gain more weight than control animals given sugar-sweetened food or water.4,5 Further, most of these studies report that calorie intake between the groups is equivalent, suggesting that animals exposed to artificial sweeteners eat more food than controls such that they experience no net reduction in total energy intake. (This also suggests that artificial sweeteners may decrease energy expenditure, resulting in increased weight gain despite comparable calorie intake.) Results from human epidemiological studies mostly align with the animal data, revealing positive associations between non-caloric sweetener consumption and body mass index (BMI) or obesity risk. For instance, the San Antonio Heart Study found that changes in BMI over the 7- to 8-year follow-up correlated with reported ASB consumption at baseline in a dose-dependent manner (e.g., 3-10 ASBs per week was associated with a 46% greater BMI increase than non-consumption), while no such association was found with SSB consumption.6 Our research team spends hundreds of hours each month vetting studies and distilling dense literature to deliver evidence-informed insights on health and longevity.

But in the case of sweetened beverages, randomized trials have an important flaw: they can’t account for the many diverse reasons that various individuals might have for consuming sweetened drinks in the first place. Participants in RCTs consume ASBs or SSBs because they are required to do so by the study protocol, not because they’re thirsty or have a sugar craving or want the hit of caffeine that comes from a Mountain Dew or syrup-laden coffee drink. In other words, randomization—the means by which RCTs avoid the influence of confounds—imposes a level of control that doesn’t accurately recreate real-world consumption of sweet beverages because it overrides the key variable of motivation. Of course, a Coke is a Coke (and a Diet Coke is a Diet Coke) regardless of whether you’re consuming it out of thirst or a sweetness craving. So why do we care about motivation? Indeed, the intent behind consumption may not affect the direct impact of the beverage itself, but it often does affect other nutritional decisions we make throughout the day. If you’re drinking a sugary beverage because you crave a shot of sweetness, you will probably end up replacing the calories with other sources of sugar if you switch to alternatives sweetened with low-calorie sugar substitutes. Experimental evidence in humans and animals has demonstrated that nearly all non-caloric sweeteners fail to recreate the neural responses of real sugar—i.e., activating the brain’s reward circuitry and triggering a sense of satisfaction.7,8 Thus, when the specific goal of consuming sweet beverages is to achieve satisfaction of a craving, ASBs simply aren’t going to cut it, and eventually you’ll likely seek out that satisfaction through other sweets. This may not be a bad thing—for instance, you might try to get sugar from a piece of fruit, which is a better source of sugar than soda because it contains vitamins and fiber and doesn’t spike blood glucose as quickly as liquid sugar sources—but you nevertheless aren’t likely to see net benefits on body weight. However, sweetness isn’t the only motivation for consuming sweet drinks. Many people drink Coke simply because they’re thirsty and need something to wash down lunch or because they like the caffeine. In such cases, a sweet taste may be desirable to improve palatability, but sweetness is not the objective in itself (for instance, many people add sugar or syrup to their morning coffee because they want caffeine but find black coffee too bitter, not because they crave sugar). When satisfaction of a sweet tooth isn’t the goal, the absence of sweet-related reward signaling doesn’t undermine the intended outcome from beverage consumption—diet drinks satisfy thirst and provide caffeine just the same as their sugar-heavy counterparts. Thus, swapping for diet options in these instances is not likely to create a strong drive to seek out more food and sugar from other sources, and the switch could indeed lead to reduced total calorie consumption. Motivation matters All research on the long-term metabolic health effects of sugar and sugar substitutes is beset with shortcomings—a common problem in nutrition, which is so intricately tied to countless other variables of daily life and culture. These variables may substantially influence the relationship between a given exposure (e.g., non-calorie sweeteners) and a given outcome. We’ve seen on numerous occasions how this can compromise epidemiology studies, which are subject to the impact of confounding, but the problem also affects RCTs, as overly controlled study conditions can eliminate critical modifiers of a given exposure–outcome relationship. With respect to sweeteners and their impacts on health, the list of modifiers is long. In the recent AMA, we discussed several such variables—from the type of sugar or sugar substitute to the timing of intake—for which we have fairly clear data from research. But although motivation may be more difficult to evaluate in a direct, empirical manner, the indirect insights we have thus far support the idea that it can have a profound influence on the relationship between sweetened drinks and weight changes. For those seeking sweetness per se, switching from SSBs to ASBs will likely result in compensatory sugar intake from other sources, yielding no net change in body weight or even possibly a slight increase. But when sweetness isn’t the explicit goal, the same switch may indeed result in the modest weight loss reported in many RCTs. In other words, why one chooses to switch to artificially sweetened beverages may be even more important than whether one chooses to switch when it comes to body weight and metabolic effects.

Recognizing the confusion these claims have sparked among patients, listeners, and the broader public, Peter uses this episode to provide a framework for thinking critically about complex conditions and the research related to them. He highlights the dramatic rise in autism diagnoses over recent decades, noting that multifactorial conditions rarely have a single cause, and emphasizes the importance of resisting oversimplified explanations. Peter also stresses that humans are not naturally wired for scientific thinking, making disciplined frameworks like the Bradford Hill criteria essential for evaluating causality in epidemiology. Ultimately, he uses this framework to explore the evidence surrounding acetaminophen use during pregnancy and its potential link to autism.

Show Notes Laying the groundwork for this discussion, the rise in autism rates, and the value in using frameworks [A: 1:00, V: 0:09] If you’ve been following the headlines recently, you may have seen stories linking acetaminophen (or Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism [ASD] Not surprisingly, those headlines have generated a lot of questions, a lot of controversy, and a lot of confusion Peter has heard about this a lot from every direction: his patients, listeners of the podcast, friends, family members, people writing in through the website Like many people in this space, we’ve all been inundated by it “The more I thought about it, the more I realized this was a great opportunity to put forth a framework for how to think about these things critically.”‒ Peter Attia While we initially thought we would just do this in the newsletter last week, once we got into it, we realized now this doesn’t really lend itself to an article or even a short video It really commands effectively the discipline of what we do in the AMAs (the Ask Me Anything episodes) Unlike a normal AMA, this is going to be made available to everybody Groundwork before we dig in We’re going to unpack some of the points in more detail that Peter is going to lay out below, but he wants to make sure we’re starting from a place of reference Peter wants to start out with a few important observations 1 – Autism rates have risen dramatically over the past generation Now we’re going to talk about why that might be But it’s very important to state upfront that there is unlikely to be a single cause. Why? Because complex conditions usually don’t have simple explanations This is true of obesity, despite what some people would have You believe that it’s just this one thing or just this one thing or whatever, but the reality of it is complex conditions require multiple things typically Anytime we look at a possible contributing factor, we need to resist the temptation to assume it’s the sole cause Now that doesn’t diminish the interest in identifying a bunch of potential causes 2 – Science is supposed to be apolitical Unfortunately, that’s not the case and for reasons Peter doesn’t think he’s smart enough to understand, autism happens to be one of those examples But so are many other topics we’ve discussed like nutrition or protein, which has become remarkably political Peter’s goal here is not to have a political debate, but rather to examine the evidence as carefully and objectively as he can 3 – We do need to realize something that is very hard to accept, and that is that as humans, we are not wired to think scientifically Peter wants to restate that because it sounds condescending, but it’s simply an observation of how we have evolved We are not wired for critical and scientific thought This is something Peter has written about This piece from over 10 years ago synthesizes that point really well It really comes down to the fact that we should understand that both the scientific method and critical thought are human inventions They’re wonderful inventions, and Peter would argue they are the single most important invention our species has ever put forth And without this, nothing else would exist Without this, we’d still be living in caves But that doesn’t mean that it comes naturally, and it doesn’t mean we’re wired to do it Peter adds, “Just keep that in mind as you catch yourself (as I catch myself) falling into non-scientific thought. We’re going to rely on a framework at some point during this discussion, which is very helpful.” 4 – The branch of science we’re going to be talking primarily about today is epidemiology, and when considering epidemiology the Bradford Hill criteria are key ⇒ The Bradford Hill criteria are 9 principles that were laid out in the mid-60s to help us determine whether an observed observation is likely to be causal [summarized in the figure below] This framework looks at things like strength of association, consistency across multiple studies, biologic, plausibility, temporality and things like that They’re not a checklist per se, but they provide a disciplined way to try to make sense of correlations and interpret which ones have a higher probability of being causal from those that don’t Figure 1. The Bradford Hill criteria. Summarized from: European Journal of Epidemiology 2021 Another thing to point out is we’re going to be talking about medications; we’re going to be talking about pregnancy 5 – Anyone listening to this or watching this who has gone through pregnancy will understand that the bar is very high when we are talking about medications to be used during pregnancy Most physicians (Peter included) don’t treat very many pregnant women We think about drugs and supplements very differently in the setting of pregnancy, of course, because we are typically not treating patients with life-threatening conditions Peter explains, “Our mantra is during pregnancy, women should basically stop all medications and supplements beyond the obvious ones (such as prenatal vitamins or hormones such as thyroid hormone, which can be essential), but anything that’s even in a gray area or probably okay, we tend to just avoid.” The FDA pregnancy drug categories, where Tylenol falls within that framework, and a structured method for evaluating scientific evidence and causality [A: 6:00, V: 5:33] Now since the late 70s, the FDA has used a very simple letter system to classify drugs by their risk during pregnancy These categories go by A, B, C, D, and X, and basically each letter refers to a level of evidence, mostly from animal and human studies about the potential harm of the drug to the fetus For more than 35 years or so, this was the framework physicians relied on About 10 years ago, the FDA replaced with a framework that is called the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) The idea was to move away from single letters and instead provide a more descriptive guidance And in theory, that’s an improvement, but in practice it’s been kind of slow to roll out and frankly Peter is a little guilty of generally thinking about it in the ABCDX category, and that’s what he’s going to refer to a little bit (he’s going to stick with that older category) And while it’s imperfect, it’s widely understood, it is still a clear framework, and he wants to share with you as we begin this so you have a broad sense of how drugs fit into this [summarized in the figure below] Figure 2. FDA pregnancy categories. Adapted from: Wikipedia Category A means that there is no demonstrated risk in well controlled human studies That’s pretty unusual because that’s a hard thing to do, and that’s reflected in the proportion of total drugs and supplements out there that fit in this category (2-5% of drugs) That means it’s completely safe ‒ we have definitive evidence that women can take these things during pregnancy Virtually nothing fits into this category But the examples Peter gave earlier of thyroid hormone and prenatal vitamins do fit in this category Category B says there is no evidence of risk in humans, but animal data might show signals in some studies These are generally thought of as safe, but exercise caution This is 15 to 25% [of drugs] Category C says risk cannot be ruled out We don’t have evidence that there is risk, but we don’t have evidence that it’s safe Most drugs sit here, somewhere between 60-75% Peter will come back and give examples of drugs that sit in this category You might say, “Why would a woman ever take a drug if there’s some evidence of risk to the fetus?” That is only if the risk to the mother not taking it is greater The classic example here is seizure medication [in category C] If you have a woman who is going to be debilitated by seizures and this is the only treatment she can have, then a physician will typically make that decision And again, very few drugs fit in category C: typically 5-8%, Category X are drugs that have definitively been proven (as much as you can prove anything in biology) to cause significant harm to the fetus regardless of benefit to the mother Again, these are pretty rare: 1-3%. Where does Tylenol or acetaminophen fit into that? It fit its into category B And to be clear, for the last 10 years there has been some concern about: Does Tylenol belong in category B? Should it belong in category C? The other thing to keep in mind with Tylenol is you always have to ask yourself about the switching cost or the alternative choices A very common alternative choice for Tylenol would be something like ibuprofen or an NSAID ⇒ Ibuprofen (Advil, Aleve, for example) are considered category B in the first 2 trimesters, but bump to category D in the third trimester For those who are interested, it has to do with the premature closure of a very small blood vessel that connects the aorta and the pulmonary artery, and if that closes prematurely, it leads to premature delivery and all sorts of things like that Keep in mind the reason we’re walking through all of this now is to just sort of set the stage for this discussion The goal today is not just to look at the potential link between acetaminophen and autism, but also to put it in context so that we can hopefully end with the question that some of you are asking, “Okay, science aside Peter, what’s the bottom line? If a woman is pregnant, should she be taking Tylenol?” Of course, to answer that question, you have to not only take into account the possible effective Tylenol exposure on the baby But also the health and the wellbeing of the mother And also the possible effects of going without Tylenol in the case of fever or inflammation, which is also associated with negative health outcomes for babies that are exposed to those conditions in utero Peter’s framework We’re going to take the same structured approach that Peter tries to recommend and utilize any time he’s confronted with an association between exposure X and condition Y And that’s true if condition Y is positive or negative, good or bad 1 – The first thing you want to be able to do is confirm that there is indeed an association statistically A lot of times people say there’s an association, but there might actually not be So you actually want to document that statistically there is an exposure (verify that) 2 – The second question you’re asking is the hardest one: If there is a statistical association, you want to determine the likelihood that the association is causal Included in this would be sensitivity analysis, falsification tests, and things of that nature Peter adds, “Now notice I said you’re not trying to prove if the association is causal. Why? Because as I’m sure many of you heard me say before, there are no proofs in biology. It’s not like mathematics. You don’t get to write QED at the end of your work here.” What we’re really dealing with here is probabilities and we’re trying to determine the likelihood of causality Now, if the association is believed to be more likely causal than not, then we have to ask the final question [listed next] 3 – We have to understand the effect size The final question factors into: What do you do? So you could have things that are causal, but the effect size is so small that it doesn’t matter In which case your behavior is going to be quite different Final point: it’s a very important to remember that we’re discussing the state of science today And science is not about being right or wrong in an absolute sense It’s really about constantly updating our priors, understanding the probability of something as new evidence becomes emergent That’s how we should really work ‒ as more and more data come online, we might have to revise our views and conclusions Doing so is not a weakness Although tragically it has become viewed as a weakness Certainly if politicians change their mind about things that’s viewed as waffling As scientists or as communicators of science, we shouldn’t be afraid of that We should be open and acknowledge that as of today, this might be how we view things and in the presence of new information, and we should be very receptive to changing that mind Peter knows that was a lot of background, but it’s really important to have a shared foundation of knowledge and an understanding of the framework before we wade into a topic that is not only scientifically complex, but obviously very emotionally and politically charged That’s the lens he is hoping to use for this discussion With all of that said, rather than just continue a monologue, it would be great to have our co-host, Nick Stenson from the AMAs join and basically lay out this discussion in the form of a Q & A What exactly are the claims being made about acetaminophen and autism? [A: 13:45, V: 14:13] First lay the foundation of the claims being made about acetaminophen and autism The basic gist of the scientific claim is that maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism in the exposed child Tylenol being the most common and the most familiar to reflect the possible risk during pregnancy And this has prompted the government to respond by asking the FDA to issue warnings to physicians and change the labels on acetaminophen products ⇒ It’s important to note that both the FDA and the scientific community agree that we don’t yet have evidence to assert that the apparent correlations between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and autism risk reflect a causal relationship In other words, no authoritative sources are claiming that we can conclude from the existing body of evidence that acetaminophen actually causes an increase in autism risk Though some argue that a causal relationship is plausible and others argue that a causal relationship is very likely and that acetaminophen should therefore be avoided during pregnancy (or used at most with strong precaution) The increase in autism rates and why so many things are being linked to autism: the multiple comparisons problem [A: 15:00, V: 15:27] You mentioned there could be a lot of reasons why we’re seeing autism rates increase and not just a single thing. What do we know about why there are so many things being linked to autism these days? There’s 2 parts to this question 1- You’re asking why autism rates are going up? We can’t deny that 2 – The second question is why are there so many things being linked to autism these days? This is the more jugular question at the moment, but Peter will get to #1 later It comes down to a very understandable, rational and logical desire, a very strong motivation to look for the triggers of autism We are looking for culprits Autism rates have risen dramatically both nationally and even globally over the past few decades ⇒ According to the CDC, the prevalence of autism increased from 6.7 cases per thousand children in the year 2000 (just 25 years ago) to 32.2 cases per thousand children just 3 years ago [in 2022] That’s a 5-fold increase There are lots of explanations for this, which we’ll get to That is not a subtle increase, and while some of that increase is due to an expanding diagnostic definition and increased awareness (which we’ll get into more later), there is no doubt that some residual increase is out there, even after accounting for these changes Therefore, in an effort to find these potential causes, a lot of research has been done to find potential associations between autism and countless other variables Now, all of that sounds great and all of that makes sense, but it poses a significant statistical problem And this is known as the multiple comparisons problem: if you look at enough variables, you are bound to find statistically significant associations Peter points out, “This is the first example that I’m going to pull forth from what I stated at the outset, which is we are not wired to think scientifically if anybody out there thinks they are smart enough that they can understand p-values out of the womb, more power to you.” Peter majored in mathematics, and spent his life doing mat and stats This idea is not that intuitive until it is explained to you So it’s understandable why what he’s about to say doesn’t necessarily jump to your mind as the explanation for this An example to understand the multiple comparisons problem Imagine if you’re trying to detect if someone has psychic powers by having them guess the outcome of coin flips You create the rules such that if they guess correctly on at least 7 out of 10 flips, they will be declared a psychic Which by the way, that’s a 5% chance somebody would do that based on pure luck with a fair coin If you flipped a coin 10 times, each of those has a 50-50 shot of heads or tails But if you can guess correctly, 7 out of 10, 8 out of 10, nine out of 10 or 10 out of 10, there’s only a 5% chance of doing that That game is basically like a single hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.5 You see where Peter is going with this He’s setting this up like a single hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.05 or a p-value of 0.05 Now suppose instead of just testing 1 person, I’m going to test 100 random people all with fair coins And let’s assume for the purpose of illustration, there are no real psychics By chance alone, I’m going to identify 5 people out of 100 who are going to pass the psychic test and they’re going to look like psychics ⇒ But the probability that at least 1 person passes the test isn’t just 5%, it’s much higher because randomness can hit anywhere across that group So if you keep scaling this up to 1000s of tests Like scanning genes for diseases and links And running marketing experiments ⇒ Anytime you’re running massive amounts of experiments, the odds of finding at least 1 false hit approaches near certainty You’re essentially trolling through noise until patterns emerge by accident like seeing faces in clouds or winning a lottery if you buy enough tickets There’s a great website called spurious correlations Peter has been playing with this website for a long time and went back to it recently It shares examples of how easy it is to find significant correlations, even very strong correlations between variables that clearly have nothing to do with each other, provided you’re willing to look at enough different combinations of variables One very silly example is a 98.5% correlation between the per capita consumption of margarine and the divorce rate in Maine [shown in the figure below] <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"668\" height=\"410\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f3-tylenol.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35255\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f3-tylenol.png 668w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f3-tylenol-300x184.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f3-tylenol-400x246.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" /> Figure 3. An example of a spurious correlation. Image credit: TylerVigen.com #5,920One of Peter’s personal favorites: if you look at the number of physicists in the state of California and the ranking of Michael Schumacher when he was driving in F1 between the year 2003-2012, the correlation was 0.971 (97.1%) [shown in the figure below] <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"668\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f4-tylenol.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35256\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f4-tylenol.png 668w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f4-tylenol-300x181.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f4-tylenol-400x242.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" /> Figure 4. Another example of a spurious correlation. Image credit: TylerVigen.com #3,705 But what’s most interesting about this is that the site also demonstrates how easy it is to come up with plausible sounding stories for why too clearly unrelated variables might be related So they ask AI to come up with a train of logic linking the variables If you consider the example of the California physicists and Michael Schumacher’s success, AI explains that by saying that the rising number of physicists in California drive innovation in the automotive industry, which leads to faster and more effective race cars that propelled Michael Schumacher to higher rankings Which of course is ridiculous What do we know about why these ideas about associations with autism tend to persist even if the evidence can be shaky? It comes down to the fact that it is literally impossible to disprove the link between any variable and autism the way that you can disprove other things such as the earth being flat Or even things that are really complicated like resveratrol extending mammalian life where you have the luxury of doing randomized controlled experiment after experiment after experiment, all of which fail Where you have such a high degree of probability that you’ve effectively disproved it But we can’t do that in epidemiology, and Peter thinks that’s why these ideas persist Evaluating the review paper that triggered the recent concern over acetaminophen and autism [A: 21:45, V: 22:34] Going back to the recent news, was there anything in particular that triggered the recent concern around acetaminophen and autism? Not really other than a publication that we’ll talk about But the idea that autism might be linked to prenatal acetaminophen exposure isn’t new A handful of studies have reported very small associations between that exposure and outcome over the past decade, more or less The recent alarm was triggered by a systematic review of earlier research, which was published in late August in a journal called BMC Environmental Health Peter was surprised to see this publication was not a meta-analysis They didn’t pool the data from the studies to reevaluate the overall association or perform any new statistical tests The authors of this paper just collected all the relevant studies they could find on the relationship between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and the risk of autism They also looked at ADHD and some other neurodevelopmental disorders in non-overlapping human cohorts And they shared the basic study details and results in one place and added some additional commentary You can think of it as a review article Breakdown this paper in more detail: what did it show? In the case of autism, there were 6 observational studies that met their criteria for inclusion The authors reported that these 6 studies, “Consistently reported a positive association between prenatal acetaminophen use and ASD (autism spectrum disorder) with an exposure response relationship observed in 4 of the 5 studies that evaluated the relationship.” But this isn’t actually true 2 of the 6 studies showed no significant association between use of acetaminophen used during pregnancy and the risk of autism in the offspring And only 3 of the included studies directly examined the potential dose-response relationship While the 4th (by authors Ji and others) attempted to assess dose: dividing the participants into tertiles (groups of thirds) based on acetaminophen detected in a single blood test This method had the advantage of using a quantitative biomarker instead of potentially biased patient questionnaires that try to get a recall But since the measurement was based on just one sample taken during birth, it’s a very poor indicator of overall exposure during pregnancy Acetaminophen is almost completely eliminated from the body within 24 hours So all the blood tests from the Ji study really tell us is whether or not a woman happened to take Tylenol in the 24 hours leading up to delivery Of course, a woman who had none before delivery might have taken Tylenol for weeks on end earlier in her pregnancy, or a woman could have taken Tylenol with delivery, could have had none up until that point We’re going to look at all of these studies in a moment, but Peter wants to point out 2 major limitations: Most of these studies rely on questionnaires The Ji study attempted to look at this biomarker, but it has significant limitations [which he just explained] The largest study examining a dose response relationship was a study by lead author Ahlqvist (the senior author on that was Lee) Dr. Lee was interviewed this week by JAMA: the dose response was only present in a partially adjusted statistical model where it disappeared in what was called the “fully adjusted model” Peter will talk about this in a moment This suggests that the dose-dependent association between acetaminophen and autism (which is actually very important) was actually due to confounding variables that weren’t accounted for in the partially adjusted model, but were accounted for in the fully adjusted model To take a look at this, the figure below is an analysis that Peter’s team pulled together by plotting the risk ratios from the studies included in this analysis <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f5-tylenol.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35257\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f5-tylenol.png 728w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f5-tylenol-300x166.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f5-tylenol-400x221.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" /> Figure 5. Risk ratios from studies included in the analysis pooled into a weighted summary to show the overall association based on all of the included data. Peter was surprised that this figure was not in the paper because almost all review articles would do this (certainly a meta-analysis would’ve), but nevertheless, they didn’t And so we’ve done this and you can feel free to check us if you like, but we’ve taken all of the data out of their tables and simply put them into a pooled table Then the one thing we did at the end was pool it ‒ that’s what’s shown in red here To orient you to this figure You’ve got all the names of the studies [on the left] The Ahlqvist study is referred to as the Swedish study At the very top, you’ve got the sibling controlled version of the Swedish study followed by the full cohort of the Swedish study, followed by a set of other studies Then the Ji study, you’re seeing 2 versions of this You’re seeing the third tertile compared to the first tertile And the second tertile compared to the first tertile You then have a couple of these other studies ⇒ And then you can see that summary in red is where we’re showing the pool data Walk people through what this chart is showing us What are the big insights that you and the team had from this chart ⇒ In this chart you can see that the overall association between acetaminophen use and autism is very small, corresponding to just a 5% increase in relative risk between exposed and unexposed children But there are a few other details that jump out at you when you’re looking at this The most obvious feature is that there is a very strong association coming from 1 very small study In fact, the smallest study here, which is the Ji study from 2020 But as discussed a minute ago, this study was done very different from the others: instead of comparing the risk between children who were versus were not exposed to acetaminophen during gestation, they then just divided the participants into 3 groups (or tertiles) based on the concentration of acetaminophen that was detected in the samples of umbilical cord blood So then you could compare the risk in the first to the second and the first to the third tertiles respectively Measuring the concentration of acetaminophen in samples of umbilical cord blood might eliminate the issue of recall bias (which of course is a real issue as well where you have to ask a woman after she has the baby, how much Tylenol did you take during your pregnancy and when, etc.) ⇒ But it still has a pretty big issue, which is acetaminophen does not stick around very long in the blood, and therefore we don’t really know how much the acetaminophen levels identified in cord blood at the time of delivery really tell us anything about the amount of acetaminophen that the woman took during pregnancy Now, some have pointed out that this isn’t a concern since the study published this past January by another group reported a positive correlation between 3 levels of self-reported acetaminophen use throughout pregnancy The levels were: non-use, <14 days, or >14 days And the level of acetaminophen detected in cord blood at birth However, the correlation was not that great. It was 72% and involved a completely distinct cohort. There’s certainly a lot of room for error based on that Additionally, the Ji study mentions that all cord blood samples contained detectable levels of acetaminophen, but they don’t actually report how those levels differed across the tertiles (either averages or thresholds) So we have no idea how much acetaminophen we’re actually talking about here However, they do report that 70% of the samples had no detectable levels of acetaminophen metabolites Which would strongly suggest that the majority of participants had very minimal levels of acetaminophen exposure such as what you might see through drinking water Peter explains, “This essentially means that the comparison between the second and first tertiles was comparing subtherapeutic exposure to subtherapeutic exposure (telling us virtually nothing).” And as further evidence of this, that paper Peter just mentioned that looked at comparing cord blood levels to recall, it divided them into nothing up to 14 days, more than 14 days: it found acetaminophen in all cord blood samples, yet it showed that tertiles 1 and 2 were statistically identical ⇒ The suggestion here is there’s some low level of hermetic Tylenol (or Tylenol metabolite) that we’re probably all exposed to that doesn’t really constitute an exposure Another issue (and Peter actually thinks this is the single biggest issue) seems to be the biased participant inclusion The participants in the Ji study were enrolled in 1998 and followed for another 20 years, and anybody who dropped out before the end of that 20 year mark was excluded Think about that for a moment: people are more likely to stay in an extended longitudinal study if they have a personal interest in the results For instance, if they find their child has autism This is likely to affect studies on this subject, but it seems especially pronounced in the Ji paper as this study which was based in the US reported rates of autism in the participants at roughly 11% Meaning when you look at all the participants who completed that study, 11% of the kids had autism But for context, the general population currently (at that 5x increase) is 3% And at the time of enrollment it was 0.7% (the enrollment was between 98-2004) The cohort used for this, the Ji study was the Boston birth cohort, which originally enrolled almost 9,000 mother child pairs, but among them preterm births were quite overrepresented over 35% By 2018, approximately 3000 dyads remained in the active follow-up cohort, presumably due to loss on follow-up And of those eligible dyads, slightly <1000 had available umbilical cord plasma samples and complete outcome data We have kind of a concentration, it would seem of [autism] cases due to all the reasons just stated Peter makes the point, “One of the most important things to take away from this graph is the fact that the risk estimates summarized from all the studies what we’re sort of calling the pooled one here in red is virtually identical to the risk estimate derived solely from the 2024 Ahlqvist study, which was done in Sweden.” ⇒ The 2024 Ahlqvist study is commonly referred to as the Swedish cohort study The reason these studies are essentially identical is that the Swedish study included more than 10x the number of participants than all other studies combined It’s actually worth just summarizing that again before we move on to the Swedish study… If you looked at this graph that we put together, you could very easily come to the conclusion that the Ji study is indeed the smoking gun But again, you have to remember the limitations of this: Sample size is incredibly small relative to the others You have the concentration effect where based on the nature of the study you concentrated and disproportionately counted cases of autism versus non Then of course you have the collection methods where using this single sample of cord blood, which may have some association with maternal use during pregnancy, but is very unlikely to account for the actual nuanced differences in dose and exposure during pregnancy Think about that through the lens of any other thing: If I could only measure how many donuts you ate on your birthday, it would be very difficult for me to impute how many donuts you eat over the course of a year Would it have a correlation? Probably, but it wouldn’t be strong enough to take to the bank if I was trying to use donut consumption as a marker of predicting heart disease So again, it’s very tempting when you look at these meta-analyses or in this case even just a review article to think more is better, but remember “a thousand sows ears makes not a pearl necklace” (quoting the great James Yang who used to be one of Peter’s mentors in the lab) Breaking down the largest studies on prenatal Tylenol exposure and autism: is there a causal link? [A: 35:00, V: 36:20] Can you walk people through the Swedish study and what it found in more detail? The Swedish study was a very large prospective cohort study, and the general results indicate a small correlation between acetaminophen use by the mother during pregnancy and later life ASD in the offspring There were just under 2.5 million Swedish children included in the full cohort And the primary exposure metric was ever use of acetaminophen in pregnancy with dose serving as a secondary metric So the primary outcome is binary: either you ever used acetaminophen or you did not Acetaminophen use was determined through a combination of prescriptions Because in a single healthcare system, they have access to all the prescriptions and also through maternal interview with midwife or physician throughout the pregnancy They don’t specify the number of interviews, and it probably varied across participants The median follow-up was about 13.5years ⇒ The general cohort showed a very small but statistically significant positive association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and autism The hazard ratio was 1.05 and the confidence interval was 1.02 to 1.08 That means it showed a 5% increase in relative risk and the confidence interval of 95% confidence was significant because it did not cross the unity line So anytime the error bars do not cross the unity line, it’s statistically significant Going back to the goal of studying study stuff: we always like to calculate an absolute risk exposure if we can ⇒ The relative risk was a 5% increase; the absolute risk increase was 0.09% increase at 10 years That’s a very small absolute risk increase, less than 1/10th of 1% The researchers then examined risk specifically in a cohort subset that was composed of matched sets of full biologic siblings ⇒ They examined sibling pairs that were discordant in acetaminophen exposure and found no significant difference in risk for autism between exposure and lack of exposure So why do this? The logic here is similar to any matched cohort study, but instead of merely matching based on general characteristics like age or sex, each exposed individual is matched to an unexposed sibling This means that exposed and unexposed groups on the whole should be relatively evenly matched in terms of several confounding variables related to home environment, and even many genetic factors Each person in one group could be mirrored by somebody in the control group, so there shouldn’t be any systematic differences between the groups Walk people through what happened when they did the more detailed sibling analysis When they did that concordant-discordant analysis, the correlation was entirely abolished when they compared and controlled for family, environment and genetics This was not an identical twin comparison, it was just siblings, but obviously this is the best control you could get This suggests that the apparent link observed in the full cohort was likely due to confounding factors Given these results, the authors of the Swedish study came to the same conclusion and they stated, “The results of this study indicate that the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders is a non-causal association. Associations observed in models without sibling control may be attributable to confounding.” Now it’s important to note that the review article that came out in August, in their analysis they state that the Swedish study only included siblings that were discordant for both exposure and outcome But this was not the case according to the Swedish study’s senior author ⇒ Such a design would introduce what’s known as a collider bias, where the selection criteria create a situation where the exposure and outcome are already related in some way To illustrate why this double discordance selection doesn’t work, consider a very extreme example Imagine autism can only occur with acetaminophen exposure, but that acetaminophen exposure does not guarantee autism So in biological parlance, we would say acetaminophen is necessary but not sufficient If you select only pairs that are discordant for both the exposure and the outcome, you would exclude all cases in which acetaminophen exposure did not result in autism Even if those sibling pairs accounted for the majority of sibling pairs discordant for the exposure In other words, you would falsely conclude 100% risk Therefore, Peter believes that Lee (the senior author of the Swedish study) is correct in his assessment: once you correct for genetics and home environmental exposures, the risk of autism as it pertains to acetaminophen exposure is not causal “Stated another way, acetaminophen exposure prenatally in the Swedish cohort does not appear to be causally related to autism.”‒ Peter Attia Do people who argue in favor of a potential link between acetaminophen and autism have anything to say about those results? Is there any reason to question those results and question what that study said? Yes, you should question everything One of the criticisms that’s been leveled against the Swedish study is that the overall rates of acetaminophen use in that study were much lower than what is observed here in the US or elsewhere in the world ⇒ Only about 7.5% of the participating mothers in the Swedish study were consumers of acetaminophen, whereas some studies have reported up to 50% of mothers using acetaminophen during pregnancy Given this discrepancy, some have argued that the generalizability of the Swedish study is limited A Japanese study was just published As it happens, another large cohort study with a similar nested sibling analysis was just published a couple of weeks ago This was after the August publication of the review article And it supports the findings of the Swedish study The new study was conducted in a nationwide Japanese population and consisted of almost 220,000 children Of which almost 40% were exposed to acetaminophen during gestation So very similar to the rates we see in the United States and in some of the other high exposure studies ⇒ The associations reported from this Japanese cohort were similar to those in the Swedish study In the general cohort (so un-adjusting for siblings), prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with a 6% uptick in autism rates Recall in the Swedish study it was 5% This association did not reach statistical significance The confidence interval was 0.98 to 1.15 The 95% confidence interval crossed the unity line When they did the sibling analysis, even this small trend towards an increased risk was completely abolished So when you take this Japanese study of nearly 220,000 children and pair it with the Swedish study of 2.5 million children, and both of them when done by this method abolish any causality, it’s very difficult to make a strong case for causality Why observational studies can’t prove causality, the role of confounding variables, and the importance of frameworks like the Bradford Hill criteria [A: 43:30, V: 45:08] Can you walk people through why it’s so hard to make assumptions about causality based on just observational data? You can think back to the sort of spurious correlation site that Peter was talking about earlier It really comes down to the potential influence of confounding variables that we are blind to Dr. Lee, the senior author of the Swedish paper, was interviewed by JAMA this week It’s a great interview; it’s worth reading He talks about a great example many people have heard before, but it’s worth repeating It’s the example of the strong correlation between ice cream consumption and drowning As we see rates of ice cream consumption go up, we see drowning deaths go up; and as one falls, the other falls Obviously, if you were being cheeky, you would say somehow eating ice cream is causing people to drown But of course, there’s a confounding variable, and the confounding variable is heat Peter explains, “The warmer it gets, the more people are likely to eat ice cream and separately, the more people are likely to swim. And therefore it’s this confounding variable that isn’t immediately obvious that explains both of these things.” That’s really the challenge of epidemiology, and Peter doesn’t say that as a knock on epidemiology (it’s a legitimate challenge) It’s that you can never, ever, ever identify all of the confounders And therefore you are always at the mercy of wondering, “Is there something I’m not seeing here that is what is actually explaining the causality?” ⇒ The only way to show causation unfortunately, is through randomized trials That’s the only way you can really be as close to 100% sure that you’ve established causality by doing a well controlled randomized control trial [RCT] But unfortunately, some questions do not lend themselves to that for either ethical or logistical reasons And clearly this question (the use of acetaminophen and autism) is one of those tricky questions So we’re not going to get an RCT to do this, and instead we’re going to have to glean what we can as best we can from epidemiology And that’s where we get to this set of guidelines that Peter talked about at the top of the show called the Bradford Hill criteria Applying the Bradford Hill criteria: testing the case for Tylenol and autism [A: 45:45, V: 47:48] The Bradford Hill criteria are a set of 9 principles used to assess whether an observed association is likely to reflect a true causal relationship Sir Austin Bradford Hill in 1965 put forth these criteria to help epidemiologic researchers examine their data when RCTs were not available They consider factors like: strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, biological plausibility, coherence, experimental evidence, and analogy [summarized in the figure below] <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"727\" height=\"669\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f6-tylenol.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35258\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f6-tylenol.png 727w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f6-tylenol-300x276.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f6-tylenol-400x368.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" /> Figure 6. The Bradford Hill criteria. Summarized from: European Journal of Epidemiology 2021 Let’s just go through the state of evidence for each of those criteria So looking at acetaminophen and autism, what’s first on the list? 1 – Let’s start with strength. How large is the effect? And the larger the effect, the more likely it is to be causal Let’s start with a few obvious and famous examples The example of smoking is perhaps most notable Peter has never met a person who doesn’t understand or disputes the exposure relationship between cigarette smoke and lung cancer There’s nobody out there making the case that we need an RCT to determine that We don’t have an RCT. And why is it? It’s because if you run the smoking lung cancer data through the Bradford Hill criteria, it pops on many levels, but effect size is probably the biggest ⇒ We’re talking about an effect size of 10x [on the association between smoking and lung cancer] 10X is a magnitude beyond what we normally would find in most biologic associations ⇒ By comparison, the effect size here is 1.05x (that’s what a 5% relative risk increase is) [for the association between acetaminophen exposure in utero and autism] So this is smaller than associations that have been reported for many other things that we actually know are probably almost assuredly, not causal based on more data, such as 1 – The association between red meat consumption and type 2 diabetes, which is a 1.10 or a 10% relative risk increase per 100 gram per day increase in red meat Of course, we’ve argued ad nauseam that those associations are almost assuredly picking up a confounder, which is healthy user bias 2 – The association between poultry consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes 1.08 Again, both of these examples are stronger associations [than the association reported for acetaminophen use and autism, which is 1.05] 3 – An even clearer example would be the meta-analysis of observational studies that reported that a higher leisure time physical activity was linked to a 5% higher increase in prostate cancer Again, we know that that is completely nonsensical, but that is what you get when you go trolling for signal in a sea of noise, you will eventually find it In other words, for this, the effect size is very weak Here we’re defining weak as a subset of the type of epidemiology we’re looking at And in this case, we’re looking at pharmacoepidemiology versus say, nutritional epidemiology or toxicology epidemiology Weak is generally regarded as 1.5 for pharmacoepidemiology, and the reason for it is just based on the pervasiveness of bias throughout these studies ⇒ So when you’re showing up at 1.05 and the threshold for interesting is 1.5, you’re well below it 2 – How consistent are the data linking autism and acetaminophen? Actually they’re reasonably consistent Consistency just means how often does this show up across multiple studies and maybe even across multiple populations and different methodologies? A handful of prospective cohort studies have reported this positive association But remember, these associations tend to go away when you control for family environment or genetics As we’ve seen in the 2 largest studies here that we’ve talked about So in general, population studies (i.e. no sibling control), the reported associations have varied somewhat in magnitude Some have shown little to no association But more often there is some association 3 – Moving on to specificity. What do we know about specificity? Specificity is asking the question basically how specific is the cause-effect relationship? If an exposure is associated with only 1 outcome or an outcome associated with only 1 exposure, causal relationship is more likely ⇒ Here it’s very nonspecific because there are many variables that have been linked to autism risk Many [exposures have] much stronger lines of evidence than acetaminophen For example, advanced paternal age, premature birth, air pollution exposure, and heavy metal exposure These are all variables that have much stronger associations with autism We’re not dealing with a 1 versus 1, and some lack of specificity also exists in the other direction There’s observational studies that have also reported associations between acetaminophen use and ADHD and language development Peter explains, “What you really want to look for if you want to check the specificity box is a one-to-one mapping.” It’s not a deal breaker not to have it Cigarette smoking can cause lung cancer and other cancers and heart disease, and that doesn’t necessarily by itself at all diminish the fact that it causes lung cancer 4 – Moving next on the list we have temporality. Does the exposure precede the reported effects? It does and certainly to a first order It does meaning acetaminophen use comes before autism, but there really hasn’t been a consensus on the impact of timing of exposure or critical windows in which gestational exposure might be more problematic than others If you look at the 2 researchers most known for their belief that acetaminophen exposure raises the risk of ASD (Andrea Baccarelli and William Parker) They actually have conflicting views on the critical window of acetaminophen exposure Baccarelli, who is the author of the review paper that came out in August that we’ve been talking about, he believes that maternal use during any part of pregnancy increases the risk to the fetus While Parker believes that prenatal exposure carries relatively little risk, provided the mother has a healthy liver to process the drug Parker instead argues that the greatest risk comes with exposure in the neonatal period or even during birth itself Basically starting from the time the umbilical cord is clamped and onward 5 – What do we know about dose dependency in this case? Dose dependency (which you could also think of as biological gradient) says: the more you have the exposure, the more you should see the outcome Some studies have reported modest dose dependency based on the amount of time over which the mother was taking acetaminophen during pregnancy, but the results again have been pretty inconsistent 6 – Is there a plausible biological mechanism for exposure that might cause an effect? The mechanism of action for acetaminophen is generally pretty poorly understood It’s kind of amazing that we don’t understand how such a ubiquitous drug actually lowers temperature and alleviates pain, so therefore we don’t really have much clarity on how it might ultimately lead to autism That said, its effects are mediated at least in part through inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins (which are molecules that contribute to pain and the inflammatory response) And since prostaglandins also play a role in neurodevelopment, some researchers have argued that acetaminophen leads to autism by disrupting neurodevelopmental pathways There’s no clear evidence of this, but there is at least what we would call biological plausibility, even if at best it might be a little bit hand wavy 9 – The next criteria is analogy Analogy is where we compare the current body of evidence to another similar intervention with a more established effect Here we can look at the effect of another prostaglandin inhibitor in the CNS, which is aspirin, which has shown to have modest protective effects against autism-like symptoms in animal studies This potential protective effect was also seen in the Swedish cohort study that we talked about earlier in which sibling analyses showed a small but statistically significant reduction in autism risk with prenatal aspirin exposure This was about a 13% relative risk reduction In other words, the analogy criteria would actually argue against it based on the dual inhibition of prostaglandins between both of these drugs 7 & 8 – The last 2 criteria don’t really help us much #8 Experiment: is on whether or not we have intervention-based evidence to support these conclusions, but obviously we don’t have randomized control trials that can point to sub-analyses here An example of where we would be able to use this: if you’re looking at exercise epidemiology or nutrition epidemiology, you might not be able to answer the meta question with epidemiology, but you could do short-term well-controlled studies to show that, for example, 6 months of exercise improved blood pressure Then you’d be more likely to believe that exercise could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease if that’s what the large epi showed But again, we can’t do the short-term studies here #9 Coherence: is the final metric, which is how do we tie the observational data with the in vitro and in vivo testing? And while we have some data here, they’re very inconsistent to the question There are some studies that involve pre or perinatal acetaminophen exposure in mice and rats that have reported a few neurodevelopmental abnormalities, but they’ve been very inconsistent in the nature of the effect, and many have aligned quite poorly with the characteristics of autism For example, one study showed minor alterations in spatial learning and locomotor activity (which aren’t typically associated with ASD) but not anxiety-like behaviors (which often do accompany ASD) Additionally, some of the studies have used extreme doses, far exceeding the therapeutic doses used in humans as adults or children Putting it all together to answer the question: Does acetaminophen use during pregnancy increase the risk of autism? [A: 56:15, V: 59:03] What I think might be helpful is if you could just quickly summarize all the information we just talked about as it relates to acetaminophen and autism in looking at the Bradford Hill criteria Let’s go through them one by one 1 – Strength is definitely weak 2 – Consistency is moderate 3 – Specificity is weak 4 – Temporality is modest and probably even strong 5 – Biological gradient is moderate 6 – Plausibility is weak 9 – Analogy actually provides evidence against this effect 7 & 8 – For coherence and experiment, we don’t really have meaningful data Peter would classify coherence as probably somewhat weak Based on that, where do you land on looking at autism and acetaminophen? To the first question Peter posed (which is: Is there even a statistical association?), obviously there is in an uncorrected or unadjusted analysis Peter is really trying to refer to these adjusted analyses He would say yes, there’s probably some association between acetaminophen and autism It’s not particularly large, but let’s assume it is there The important question, and the only question that really matters here is what is the probability that that association is causal? Based on everything we’ve just talked about, inclusive of the running of the Bradford Hill criteria Peter would say the probability that the association between acetaminophen use by a mother and the development of autism of her child is a very low probability event to be causal ⇒ Peter thinks the probability that if a woman takes Tylenol during pregnancy, it’s going to increase the probability that her child has autism is very low Peter adds, “I’m sorry for using the word probability twice in one sentence, but that’s the challenge of trying to talk about this thing technically and accurately.” What will be helpful now is kind of stepping back. Early on you mentioned that one of the things we do know is that there is an increase in cases of autism Let’s assume there is causality here Is it enough to explain what we opened with which is a 5-fold increase in the prevalence of autism today? Peter thinks the answer is unquestionably no That’s a much more confident thing that we can say that there is essentially zero chance that maternal Tylenol use is the thing “responsible” for the rise in autism If it plays a role, it would be a very small role and it would have to be in this setting of another susceptibility Again, Peter still would argue that it is not playing a measurable role based on everything we’ve discussed If autism risk is overwhelmingly genetic, what explains the dramatic rise in autism diagnoses? [A: 59:15, V: 1:02:09] When you look at autism, what are some of the most important risk factors when it comes to that? This is something Peter started looking into 3 or 4 years ago; so it was nice to go back and brush up on this literature and see what had been updated The long and short it is: genetics play a much larger role in autism risk than all other variables combined and account for an estimated 80-90% of the inter-individual variability and autism risk The term for that is heritability The heritability of a trait can be assessed through studies that compare monozygotic twins (aka identical twins) and dizygotic twins (aka fraternal twins) This can also be done comparing what are called concordant-discordant identical twins or monozygotic twins, where you take identical twins that are raised in different environments There’s lots of elegant ways to do this What do we know? We know that monozygotic twins are obviously genetically identical Whereas dizygotic twins are genetically no more closely related than any other pair of siblings However, all twins are exposed to the same in utero environment and in most cases also raised in the same environment Peter mentioned that there are some studies that do look at identical twins raised apart, but let’s put that off to the side ⇒ This means that you can assume that dizygotic twins differ mostly in genetics, whereas monozygotic twins don’t really differ at all. You have a very elegant what we call “natural experiment” So if we see that a given trait is highly correlated between monozygotic twins but is often discordant between dizygotic twins, it must have a very significant impact from genes Peter wants to pause before he goes any further because so much of what he’s about to say hinges on that More about this beautiful “natural” experimental tool that we have It has come up in many of the podcasts he’s done in the past where we have talked about the heritability of various things [episode #362 ‒ Understanding anxiety: defining, assessing, and treating health anxiety, OCD, and the spectrum of anxiety disorders | Josh Spitalnick, Ph.D., A.B.P.P., after (26:30)] [episode #330 – Autism, ADHD, and Anxiety: Understanding the rise in autism and a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment of each condition in children | Trenna Sutcliffe, M.D., after (25:45)] [episode #280 ‒ Cultivating happiness, emotional self-management, and more | Arthur Brooks Ph.D., after (17:40)] [episode #268 ‒ Genetics: testing, therapy, editing, association with disease risk, autism, and more | Wendy Chung, M.D., Ph.D., after (1:41:15)] They’re almost always neuropsychiatric: the heritability of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder How are they figuring out heritability with twin studies? If you have identical twins, they are in the mother at the same time, therefore they are exposed to all of the same things while the mother is carrying them And let’s just again, limit this to all twins that are raised together (which most are), then they come out and they’re also exposed to the same environment [identical twins have the same genetics and the same environment] If you have dizygotic twins, they’re just siblings, they’re genetically obviously similar but notidentical, but they were exposed to the exact same environment inside the mother But then once they’re born, they’re exposed to comparable things outside [diozygotic twins have sibling genetics and a similar environment] ⇒ If we see that a trait is highly correlated only in the identical twins, but the correlation is nowhere near as strong in the dizygotic twins, then we know that genetics are playing the role An example everyone will appreciate: height and body weight Height has approximately an 80% heritability This shouldn’t be surprising to people We understand that on average, tall parents have tall kids and short parents have short kids Is it perfect? Not at all, but it’s 80% heritable Body weight, also quite heritable though not as much It’s about 60% heritable Back to the question about risk factor for autism In one of the studies that was included in the August review paper (the Leppert paper), the primary study actually focused on how acetaminophen used during pregnancy correlated with the mother’s genetic predisposition for autism And they didn’t find any significant association But if they had, it might suggest that a woman’s genetic predisposition towards autism might be the real variable behind the apparent association between acetaminophen and autism within the offspring If the mother is predisposed towards autism, then the child is also likely at a higher than average risk of autism based solely on genetics But if a genetic predisposition also increases the likelihood that the mother might use Tylenol during pregnancy (which is entirely possible, given that autism is related to sensory perception, which is in turn related to pain sensing), then it would appear as if acetaminophen use and the child’s risk of autism were related, even though both associations might actually be explained by genetics This is what Peter referred to above when he talked about a sort of middle confounding variable The example he gave earlier about the temperature being the thing that relates ice cream consumption and drowning In other words, genetics would constitute a confounding variable that influences both autism risk and acetaminophen use just as temperature is the confounding variable that influences both ice cream consumption and drowning If so much of autism risk is genetics, what can we say about genetics explaining the increase in autism rates over the past few decades? They definitely don’t because genetics do not shift enough over those kinds of time scales to explain this 5, 6 or potentially even 7-fold increase in autism diagnoses that we’ve seen over 2 generations Now, some cases of autism do involve de novo mutations But the majority of this increase seems to be explained by the increased awareness and expanded diagnostic definitions Let’s review a little bit of the history of how autism is diagnosed Over the last 40 years, there has been a progressive expansion of the diagnostic criteria for autism In 1987, the DSM-III made a revision which expanded from a strict infantile autism diagnosis or definition where the symptoms must occur between 30 months of age to something called autistic disorder Which was defined by a checklist of symptoms that could manifest well beyond infancy Then in the 1990s and into the 2000s, a series of revisions in the DSM-IV and the ICD-10 created something called the Pervasive Developmental Disorder family (the PDD family) Which encompassed autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, something called PDD not otherwise specified (which Peter talked about on the podcast with Trenna, it sort of became the all else bucket), Rett’s disorder, and then something called Childhood Disintegrative Disorder Childhood Disintegrative Disorder is where kids actually go on to lose an already acquired skill: so if they acquire a language skill but then go on to lose it So this further expands this recognition but with very inconsistent boundaries between the subtypes The age of onset was typically before 3 years of age Then in 2013, the DSM-V collapsed all the PDD subtypes into a single diagnosis called Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) It also relaxed the before age 3 requirement to symptoms in the early developmental period, and it introduced certain specifiers with or without intellectual or language impairment And the severity levels were based on needed support Other changes that were also made to some of the checklist criteria ⇒ The main issue is that an array of disorders are now lumped together under this ASD umbrella, which has vastly increased the number of individuals who fall under that umbrella The estimates for how much this dramatically increasing diagnostic aperture has contributed to the increase in prevalence vary ⇒ The analyses that have looked and attempted to assess this directly report that the expanded criteria account for 40 to 60% of the increase, and furthermore, increased awareness accounts for 20 to 30% of the increase in diagnoses A 2009 study found that roughly 26% of the increase in autism diagnoses in California between ‘92 and 2005 were attributable specifically to cases in which children had previously been diagnosed with mental retardation and were then subsequently screened for autism So when Peter hears people say, “Oh yes, but even the cases of severe autism are increasing,” not necessarily It could be that kids that we now think have severe autism (for example, being nonverbal) were actually previously diagnosed as something else Racial and socioeconomic disparities in autism diagnosis have narrowed or reversed over the last 30 years Which the CDC and others suggest is evidence of more widespread awareness and screening If you take these 2 together (40-60% + 20-30%), that’s really the lion’s share of what explains this increase Other risk factors for autism: parental age, maternal health, environment, and where Tylenol fits in [A: 1:09:15, V: 1:12:41] Do we know what else might be accounting for the increase, not what we just covered? The next clearest contributor is advancing parental age, both in mothers and fathers Although the paternal age probably seems to play a greater role This is seen mostly in the US and other high income countries, and various studies have put this at about 5-15% of the increase in autism prevalence [Average] paternal age has advanced in the US from 27.6 years when Peter was born [in 1973] to 31.1 years, 10 years ago [in 2015] The proportion of fathers with more advanced paternal age has also increased So fathers over 40 at the time of offspring birth has more than doubled, going from 4.1% to 8.9% And fathers over 50 has also doubled going from 0.5% to 0.9% Trends in maternal age have also increased during the same average period by about 3 years The CDC reports that between 2016-2023, the proportion of births in women aged 35 and over has increased from 10 to 12.5% Furthermore, there are other factors such as: maternal obesity, metabolic disease, preterm birth, and air pollution that are also widely recognized to contribute to the remaining 15% of unattributable factors Let’s talk briefly about these other factors 1 – Maternal health, including metabolic health is an important factor There’s no question that obesity rates among women at the time of conception have risen steadily A meta-analysis of global data reports, obesity rates in pregnancy have more than tripled in the last three decades From a pre-1990 rate of 4.7% To 16.3% in the decade from 2010 to 2020 And rates in the United States are even higher than those averages 2 – According to a 2024 CDC report, rates of early term births rose during that period as well Under 37 weeks [preterm births] and early preterm (37-38 week births) rose during that period as well So preterm births rose from 7.74% of all singletons in 2014 to 8.67% in 2020 While early term birth rates rose from 24.31% to 29.07% Sources that track earlier years indicate a steady rise in preterm birth from at least 1980 to 2005, after which rates dipped slightly before beginning to rise again in the 2010s Some of this, of course, could be attributed to advanced maternal age, which is in and of itself a risk factor for preterm birth 3 – Globally air pollution has been increasing We’ve talked about this a lot on the podcast; we talk a lot about the PM 2.5s [newsletter on this topic] Truthfully, we’ve always talked about it more through the risk of all-cause mortality and cancer mortality, but here is yet another issue We’ve seen a 38% increase in PM 2.5s These are particles that are sub 2.5 microns in the air Obviously you can’t see these things, you don’t feel these things But because of how small they are when inhaled these particles can go all the way into the bloodstream because of their ability to go straight down into the most distal part of the air sacs of the lung and cross the diffusion barrier where oxygen and CO2 are transmitted Air pollution is driven largely by the industrialization of China and India And while air pollution in the US has been coming down, we’ve seen in the last decade an uptick in this mostly attributed to wildfires Looking at what you just covered in those 3 buckets, in that last bucket of environmental factors, is it possible that acetaminophen could be in that bucket as well? Yes, it is possible Peter makes clear, “Nothing I have discussed today, none of the analysis we’ve done or anybody has done has shown dispositively that we can disprove the role, the causal role between acetaminophen and pregnancy and the elevated autism risk.” It is impossible to disprove anything We can’t disprove anything here: that’s the nature of what we’re doing epidemiologically “But the point here is look at how many other variables we have that have a either demonstrated (i.e. genetically) or much, much stronger associations that even if acetaminophen plays some causal role, it is going to be very, very low.”‒ Peter Attia Think back to what we talked about on the absolute risk increase: this was a 0.09 absolute risk increase with a 5% relative increase So even if you assume that to be causal, this would be a very, very, very small contributor relative to other modifiable things such as maternal obesity, metabolic health, air pollution, paternal and maternal age Peter doesn’t assume it to be causal because when the twin analysis was done, all of that vanished in addition to everything else we’ve talked about Peter’s takeaway: there are many things we should be looking at before acetaminophen Medication use during pregnancy: balancing risks, benefits, and FDA categories [A: 1:15:15, V: 1:19:01] What advice would you give to women who are pregnant about the use of acetaminophen? As a general rule, Peter would advise women to stop taking medications when they get pregnant But medications aren’t the only potential threat to the unborn child: the health of the mother is also important to the unborn child The medical conditions that these medications are intended to treat can sometimes also create problems indirectly or directly, but we have to balance that against the use of the medication and what’s already being addressed An example: if a woman has an elevated apoB Should she be taking a lipid lowering medication? But does she need to take that during pregnancy? Peter would argue no Why? Because 9 more months of additional apoB exposure are not a meaningful threat to a young woman’s life, whereas there may be some downside in suppressing her cholesterol synthesis if we’re talking about a statin Another example: thyroid hormone Conversely, when we think about something like thyroid hormone where we’ve established actually quite safe use during pregnancy If a woman is requiring thyroid hormone because she has hypothyroid, to withhold that from her during pregnancy would pose enormous risk to her and by extension to the child. It gets interesting when we talk about other classes of drugs For example, GLP-1 drugs: they’re very common, and of course the question is, should women stop these during pregnancy? Peter doesn’t have enough data to comment But he can tell you how one would have to think about this If a woman’s taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist is the difference between her having gestational diabetes and not, maybe it’s considered Of course, we would typically turn to something like metformin as a first line therapy there where we have much more ongoing safety data The point here is you have to be able to consider this in a nuanced way, which is the single most important thing for the healthy development of a fetus is a healthy environment in utero, and sometimes that may actually require the mother taking a medication With that kind of background, it might be worth going back to the historical FDA risk categories and just walking through what they are again And then even highlighting a few different medications that are included in each category so people just have a much better idea of how this is done in practice The good news is you don’t have to guess here. You should be talking about this with your doctor [the categories are summarized in the table below] <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"729\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f7-tylenol.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-35259\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f7-tylenol.png 729w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f7-tylenol-300x222.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f7-tylenol-400x296.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" /> Figure 7. FDA pregnancy categories. Adapted from: Wikipedia Category A This category is pretty small, we’ve only got about 2-5% of drugs here We have controlled studies in humans that demonstrate no risk to the fetus in any trimester Examples: the most obvious here are T3, T4, prenatal vitamins, that kind of stuff Category B Animal studies show no risk (for the most part, or animal risk is not confirmed) Adequate human epidemiology generally shows safety This is about 15-25% of drugs Examples: a number of antibiotics in here, things like Benadryl, as Tylenol is in here as is metformin Category C Animal studies show some adverse effects, but no real adequate human studies These are drugs that are supposed to be used provided there’s enough benefit for the mother to justify it Most drugs fit in this category, 60-70% Examples: gabapentin, amlodipine (which is a blood pressure medication), trazodone (for sleep), GLP-1 agonists, certain SSRIs or (antidepressants), and even very short-term use of narcotic pain medication Category D Here we have positive human fetal risk data, but in some cases the benefits might outweigh it Examples: a couple of seizure medications (valproic acid and phenytoin), lithium (which should be used to treat bipolar disorder), NSAIDs (which in the third trimester should be discontinued for the reasons discussed earlier), and even long-term use of narcotics Category X Drugs where there’s simply no reason for women to take these during pregnancy Examples: statins, methotrexate, and drugs that are known to cause teratogenic defects in the child Considerations for taking Tylenol during pregnancy [A: 1:19:30, V: 1:23:48] One of the other things you talked about early on in the beginning was not only do you have to look at the risk of taking the medication, but you also have to balance that in terms of what else could be going on during pregnancy How do you think about the use of acetaminophen in terms of balancing the benefits that it can have for people who are pregnant? Yes, we need to look at the other side of this equation: What’s the risk of not taking Tylenol during pregnancy? In many cases, maybe the trade-off is just an annoying headache or some other discomfort that the mother can sort of power through And in those instances, maybe she’s just better off skipping the Tylenol and trying to get to bed “We can’t discount the mother’s well-being and the importance of that as well, not just for herself but her well-being in the context of how important it’s for the unborn child.”‒ Peter Attia And we certainly shouldn’t trivialize the likelihood and presence of more intense debilitating pain with pregnancy If the pain is bad enough that she’s unable to get out of bed for several days on end, that in and of itself poses a risk to the child Let’s not forget, Tylenol is also used to reduce fever, and for this purpose, current evidence would suggest that the scales clearly tip in favor of using Tylenol since exposure to fever itself carries a number of known risk factors to a developing fetus Known risks of fever during pregnancy to children For example, children born to mothers who experience fevers during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, are at a significantly higher risk of certain birth defects than children who weren’t exposed to fever in utero Various analyses have reported anywhere from 25-200% higher risk for cleft palate or neural tube defects In fact, prenatal exposure to fever and maternal infection are also separate risk factors for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders Several studies have reported that exposure to maternal infection is associated with an increase in autism risk by 25-40% While exposure to maternal fever is typically associated with an even greater risk, up to 200% across most analyses ⇒ Some research has reported that these risks are attenuated when the mothers actually take a fever-reducing medicine like Tylenol Peter makes the point, “All of these associations between infection and fever exposure and autism may actually be contributing to the apparent correlation that we see between autism and autism risk.” Given that acetaminophen is by far the safest option for reducing fever and pain relief during pregnancy Because remember NSAIDs and opioids or category D If a woman does have an infection during pregnancy, there’s a good chance she might try to ease the fever or the aches with Tylenol In other words, it could be that it’s the infection that is the issue, and the signal we’re picking up and measuring is the acetaminophen use Final thoughts: critical thinking, balanced risk assessment, and the importance of context when evaluating medications like Tylenol during pregnancy [A: 1:22:30, V: 1:26:53] Some people might be wondering, why did you just take so long to explain all this to us? Why don’t you just give us the answer? I just want the sound bite, man Peter’s reply, “If you just want sound bites, you’re never going to learn.” Honestly, if you just want sound bites, this isn’t the podcast for you But if you actually want to be able to learn to think for yourself, then that’s what we’re here to do And that’s the reason we killed ourselves over the past week to put together the most thorough gathering of all the data we could find and the most intense night-weekend analysis possible We want to help you think about this stuff because this is not going away This is going to be a forever game of whack-a-mole There is always going to be a bad guy Peter is not going to be here every time to do a 2-hour podcast on helping you think through why exposure x leads to disease Y He doesn’t want to sound like a scolding teacher, but the truth of the matter is we live in a world today where people don’t want to think People use stupid vehicles like social media to get their information, and they don’t want to read the fine print And even if they do read the fine print, they just want to outsource thinking to somebody else Peter appreciates that those of you who are still watching this have outsourced your thinking for the past couple of hours to him But honestly, we’re never going to get out of this rut of people not knowing how to think critically unless everybody starts taking steps to try practicing this on their own Peter would encourage you to go through this and follow the logic as he’s laid it out here with the help of his team We’re going to include amazing show notes to this podcast like we do for every podcast Although for this episode, it will be not behind a paywall Normally, our show notes are only there for our subscribers And when the next thing comes up (because it will come up, whether it’s this drug or that drug or this intervention, it’s just going to keep happening over and over again), you’ve got to be able to kind of go through this type of thinking If you don’t want to, that’s fine (it is hard) But then you’ve sort of forfeited your right to have an opinion on it The upshot here is that any one potential risk can’t be considered in isolation You have to look at the full picture The risk of a given intervention like Tylenol As well as the potential risks of not taking Tylenol As well as the nature and magnitude of those risks For minor aches and pains, maybe it’s best to just err on the side of caution and skip the acetaminophen Whereas when the pain becomes really a nuisance and it might interfere with you doing things that are otherwise going to help you provide the best environment for your fetus then judicious use of acetaminophen can help (with the oversight of your physician) For maternal fever, the balance is clearly leaning towards the use of acetaminophen Peter emphasizes, “I want people to understand that the strength of these associations is very small and in many cases vanishes altogether when you apply some rigorous statistical corrections that look at the most important variables that we should be considering here, which is genetic and environmental.” He hopes that this exercise has indeed provided benefit to all of you, not just as we consider this particular question, but as we consider the onslaught of questions that we’re going to see in the future Selected Links / Related Material Newsletter about the difficulty

      "title": "When zero doesn’t mean zero: the limits of coronary calcium in women",
      "content": "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring has changed the game for preventive cardiovascular care, giving clinicians a way to directly measure atherosclerosis burden and accurately estimate cardiovascular risk. With this technique, a simple, non-invasive CT scan produces a number that correlates tightly with risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), helping to guide treatment decisions. The catch is that CAC only measures what it can see—calcification—leaving non-calcified, high-risk plaque invisible. This blind spot is especially problematic in women. CAC scores 101 Long before it can be detected with CAC scoring, atherosclerosis is progressing in blood vessels. The process begins with the accumulation of apoB lipid particles in the artery wall, where they become oxidized and trigger an immune reaction. White blood cells rush in, engulf the lipids, and turn into “foam cells.” As inflammation and remodeling continue, these fatty streaks evolve into more complex lesions called plaques. Some plaques remain soft and lipid-rich, while others become more fibrous (tissue that is more scar-like). With time, they begin to calcify—the stage quantified with CAC scoring. This calcification is quantified using non-contrast CT. Each calcified lesion in the coronary arteries is identified and scored based on its area and density. These values are then summed to create the Agatston score (named after Arthur Agatston, a cardiologist who, along with Warren Janowitiz, described the method in 1990). Scores are typically grouped into categories (0, 1–99, 100–399, ≥400) that track with increasing risk. In general, the higher the score, the greater the atherosclerotic burden, and the more compelling the case for aggressive therapy, such as with statins or other lipid-lowering medications, to prevent MACE. But there’s an important problem with this system: it is actually the non-calcified plaques that are most likely to destabilize and rupture or erode, triggering heart attacks and strokes. Calcification is the body’s attempt at healing the lesion. Laying down calcium stabilizes the plaque, thus reducing the likelihood of one of these rupture events. In fact, one of the mechanisms by which statins reduce cardiovascular risk is through calcification of the more vulnerable, non-calcified plaques. So while CAC is invaluable for quantifying calcified plaque, this measurement doesn’t capture the highest-risk plaque and is therefore only capturing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cardiovascular risk. The bulk of the threat—the non-calcified, unstable plaque—remains unseen, and the impact of this oversight is not uniform across individuals.

During this period of a woman’s life, non-calcified plaques predominate, with calcification tending to appear about a decade later in women than in men.1 The sex difference in prevalence of calcium deposits is exemplified in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), in which 62% of women had a CAC of zero compared with 40% of men.2 As a result of these differences in calcification rates, men are more likely to have detectable calcium by midlife, while women often carry lipid-rich, non-calcified plaques through their 40s and 50s. The catch-up in calcification usually comes after menopause—creating a diagnostic blind spot during midlife, when risk may be rising but CAC still reads zero. Pathology and imaging studies confirm these sex differences. Women are more likely to experience plaque erosion—a disruption of the endothelial surface over a non-calcified plaque—while men more often present with plaque rupture in lesions with fibrous caps and some calcium.3 Both mechanisms can trigger MACE, but only rupture reliably shows up on CAC. And when advanced imaging is used, the disparity is striking: high-risk plaque features predict events in both sexes but do so far more strongly in women (odds ratio 34.5 in women vs. 4.1 in men).4 In short, the plaques most likely to harm women are the very ones CAC cannot see. Importantly, none of this means CAC is completely irrelevant in women. Once calcification is present, risk rises with CAC score just as it does in men. In fact, these scores may be even more indicative of risk in women: data from the CAC Consortium show that among people with detectable calcium, women are 30% more likely to die a cardiovascular-related death compared to men.1 In other words, CAC is still predictive in women—it just underestimates risk early in the disease process, when non-calcified plaque predominates. This lag in calcium presentation in women creates the potential for missed prevention. Take a 52-year-old man with a CAC score of 72 and his 50-year-old wife with several high-risk non-calcified plaques. If we were to base intervention strategies only on CAC score, the man’s CAC score would provide a clear signal to start aggressive lipid-lowering therapy. His wife, on the other hand, would leave with a score of zero and the impression that everything is fine. By the time she’s 60, her scan finally lights up—but she’s had ten years of missed preventive opportunity. So how can we close this gap? Clinical implications Realistically, the clinical implications of CAC are the same in men and women. A high score is bad news in both sexes, and a low or zero score can be reassuring only if the rest of the risk profile is clean. In either sex, if other major risk factors are present—high apoB, hypertension, diabetes, or smoking—they warrant intervention, regardless of what the calcium scan shows. Having a CAC test does not reduce the importance of monitoring other risk factors, and a CAC score of zero should never overrule obvious risk apparent in those other metrics. When uncertainty remains, especially in women with intermediate risk and a low appetite for pharmacologic intervention, additional imaging can help contextualize risk. Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is a more sensitive test that can reveal non-calcified plaque and provide a more complete picture of disease, though it comes with trade-offs: the use of contrast dyes, higher radiation exposure than CAC, and limited value in low-risk patients. But for carefully selected patients, those trade-offs may be justified and worth discussing. The bottom line CAC is a great tool for quantifying coronary plaque burden and refining cardiovascular risk. In both men and women, higher scores predict higher risk. The difference lies at the low end of the scale. In men, a CAC of zero combined with low risk factors usually signals a truly low short-term risk. But in women, especially before menopause, the same score could be misleading. Non-calcified plaque may still be present, carrying risk that the scan cannot show. The clinical rules are the same: treat risk factors aggressively when they are present, regardless of what the scan says. A zero score should be taken as reassurance only if the rest of the profile is clean, not as a pass to ignore risk.

Show Notes Joe’s early interest in AI and the story of how he quit school to build Trilogy [A: 4:45, V: 1:29] People are probably wondering, how does this tie into health and medicine? This is a topic that’s a little bit outside of that, but really it’s not Where we’re ultimately going to go is education, and you can’t have a great system of health and medicine if you’re not educating kids today The people that are learning today are going to be the ones taking care of us, so everybody should have a vested interest in this process Of course, also, many people listening have kids across various spectrums of learning But before we get into that, Joe’s story is just so interesting And Peter knows that Joe doesn’t really like telling his story, because all he wants to do is talk about the work Where did you grow up? Joe was born in Minnesota, and he moved around every couple years, mostly up and down the East Coast His dad worked for General Electric, and wherever they had a factory, whatever town , they’d moved there You obviously did very well in high school, and you wound up at Stanford. So, what’d you major in? Econ He mostly picked it because it was easy in the Stanford curriculum He did not graduate; he dropped out between junior and senior year He would’ve been the class of 1990 He’s sure his junior year professors were like, “He’s not really engaged, and probably misses too many classes.” A little background on Joe before he went to Stanford When he was in high school, he wrote a paper on AI The paper was about expert systems ‒ an old school AI, not what we know today There was a part one paragraph called “Neural Nets,” which is sort of today’s AI, and it was like, “This is decades away.” Then Joe went to Stanford and literally was in a class with Professor Feigenbaum (who’s considered one of the fathers of expert systems and old school AI) and he’s just talking about how you can build these incredible systems, and they’d be worth millions of dollars if you could figure it out Some classmates and Joe dropped out and started Trilogy ‒ it was the first AI company They didn’t call it AI back then because it had a bad rep In the 90s, they sold a billion dollars of AI products That’s how Joe got his start, and it eventually leads to today’s story Peter always finds it amazing when people drop out with one year to go It’s like, “Why didn’t you finish it?” He thinks Joe must have had a strong conviction to forego his Stanford degree to go and start this company (that it can’t wait a year) There’s a famous Forbes headline, “You’re a moron” Joe’s dad was very clear what a moron Joe was being by dropping out The issue was Joe felt there was a time to market issue, it was a race It’s that tension where you thought “My market’s going to run away without me, and there’s a huge opportunity to go build this company.”‒ Joe Liemandt Now, with 2020 hindsight, it took them over 3 years to build a product, and they thought they could do it much quicker So there wasn’t a time to market issue And with hindsight, he could have stayed [and finished his degree at Stanford] But back to that pressure: he just felt it, he didn’t want to miss it, he had to go do it Did you guys come and set up shop in Austin right away?

      "title": "Announcing a special episode on autism and acetaminophen",
      "content": "As many of you have likely seen, recent headlines about acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism risk have generated significant controversy and confusion across the medical and scientific communities—leaving many expectant mothers understandably concerned. The controversy centers on acetaminophen (commonly known as Tylenol or paracetamol) and claims that prenatal exposure may increase the risk of autism in children. The claims were quickly met with widespread criticism, but the inundation of conflicting messaging has understandably led to considerable confusion.

Therefore, to give this subject the full attention it demands, and to never miss an opportunity to practice the skill of critical thought, we’ve decided instead to record a special podcast episode in which I will explain not only the isolated paper that largely prompted the recent announcement, but also the state of the evidence on autism and acetaminophen more broadly, as well as why research on the topics of autism and prenatal exposures can often be misleading. Stay tuned for our release of this episode next week, Monday, October 6—a slight delay that we believe will result in richer and more comprehensive content.

      "content": "In this special episode of The Drive, Peter hosts a strength and conditioning roundtable with three experts in the field—Gabrielle Lyon, Jeff Cavaliere, and Mike Boyle. Together they explore why maintaining muscle mass, strength, and power is essential for healthspan and longevity, and examine how resistance training supports metabolic resilience and injury prevention across the lifespan. The conversation covers practical strategies for getting started and staying consistent, the importance of a protein-centered diet tailored to age and activity level, and approaches to resistance training for peri- and post-menopausal women—including tendon care and optimal programming. They debate single-leg training versus heavy bilateral lifts, share knee-friendly lower-body options, and highlight exercises that belong in the “graveyard” due to poor risk-reward ratios. Finally, the group discusses youth sports specialization, emphasizing the long-term value of variety for developing lifelong athletes.

Show Notes Personal career journeys and philosophies of each guest that shaped their approaches to strength, conditioning, and lifelong health [A: 3:30, V: 1:17] This is our second version of a roundtable [The first one focused on longevity, episode #333] Unlike the first one where Peter had interviewed the 3 guests multiple times, the guests today have never been on the podcast The “non-bio” version of who each guest is Dr. Gabrielle Lyon Gabrielle is a fellowship trained physician in geriatrics and nutritional sciences She did her fellowship at WashU, and at the time she was very reluctant to do geriatrics because it can be an arduous and sad experience But she was fascinated by the nutritional research side There was a moment we were working on a study looking at body composition and brain function and she really took to one of the participants She imaged her brain, and at her mid 50s she looked like the beginning of an Alzheimer’s brain And in that moment, muscle-centric medicine, which is the concept that Gabrielle practiced and founded ⇒ Muscle-centric medicine: skeletal muscle is the focal point of all our health and wellness Gabrielle is the author of a New York Times bestseller called Forever Strong [the accompanying playbook will be published in 2026] She continues to do research and work within the space She has a medical practice and sees patients She just submitted a paper on the relationship between sexual function and muscle mass Michael Boyle Mike is a coach, this is his 43rd year coaching He was lucky enough to bounce right out of college and into a coaching job He started out as an athletic trainer He invented training for the NFL Combine in the ‘80s He worked in the NHL for the Boston Bruins from ‘90-’99 while he worked at BU [Boston University] Strength coaches were part-timers at that point in time He worked at BU for 30+ years He opened one of the first for-profit businesses around strength and conditioning in 1997 In 2012, he left BU and jumped over to the Red Soc for 2 years, where he was able to get a world series ring in 2 years He realized that was not very conductive with being a good father, a good husband ‒ so he left pro sports Currently, he coaches his son and his friends who play college lacrosse He still works as a personal trainer and as a strength conditioning coach More than anything, he’s a practitioner He sees patients that range from age 11 to 80 He doesn’t take kids until they are 11 because we really don’t want the min the gym before that His oldest client right now is 89 ‒ that’s his son’s pediatrician He has a couple of 3 generation families all training in the same space Jeff Cavaliere Jeff is a physical therapist by trade He moved out of the clinic at an early stage, got a great opportunity to work in that role for the New York Mets Which was a dream come true for him because he was a die-hard Met fan growing up From there, he piggybacked into how could he continue this education of athletes on a broader platform He was well aware of the power of the internet at that time, so he started a YouTube channel Now it’s not just about training athletes and empowering athletes, but empowering people who want to be more athletic, feel more athletic, move more athletically in daily life That became his mission Beyond having to maintain a certain level of consistency (because he wants to practice what he preaches), he has two young boys (twins) He started late; he’s 40 He wants to make sure he can keep up with them when they’re ready to have him run and play He has a lot of motivation to keep doing what he’s doing and stay in shape He believes that requires having an understanding of injury, training around injuries Because no matter what, as we get older, things do start to break down and you have to have strategies to be able to push through that and train around that And that’s where his big strength is as a PT to provide that background to help people do that more readily Why so few people engage in resistance training despite its proven health benefits [A: 8:30, V: 6:58] Do we have a sense of what percentage of people in the United States do not practice resistance training? Gabrielle Lyon We know that 50% of Americans are not training or doing any kind of exercise Probably 70% in total do not meet the criteria for both activities Mike Boyle It’s lower than 30% when you’re talking about resistance training 20% of people belong to a gym Home gym stats aren’t very good in terms of people “The home gym person who actually has one and uses it is probably more unicorn than we think they are.”‒ Mike Boyle If you start looking at that number: 20% have a membership, 50% of those people use it Which now brings us down to only 10% of people in the United States are actually in a gym Then you look at that and say what percentage of them are resistance training? Maybe now we’re down to 5% because you see a lot more hamster wheel people who are just walking on a treadmill or walking on a stair climber or whatever it is Mike thinks the numbers of people resistance training are pretty low (maybe 5%) Jeff Cavaliere We have digital statistics that actually show people who have signed up to train with our programs, let’s say either be at home or at the gym The percentage of people that make it through our programs is only 20% And that’s twice the industry standard for digital (which is usually 10% or so) Those are people who showed the commitment, made a purchase, put their hard-earned dollars behind it, have everything they need in terms of the tools and sets and reps and what’s supposed to be done and only 10% will finish a program “I think there’s a lot more of a desire to do things, but the ability to actually follow through is where, I think, we’re having the hardest time.”‒ Jeff Cavaliere Peter points out Gabrielle’s stat is 70% of 50 The reciprocal of that is 30% of 50 (or 15%) Peter has never been shy about his thesis, which is of all the pillars that we have to embark on improving our health, whether it be changing our nutrition, improving our sleep, taking the medications and supplements, that can be actually quite important Peter doesn’t see any evidence that anything trumps exercise Purely from an actual lifespan perspective and from the standpoint of reducing the risk of chronic disease When you then layer in the benefits it has on quality of life, it’s just a no-brainer What do you think explains the disconnect between the fact that we have this incredible tool that will lengthen your life, improve the quality of your life, make you look and feel better, and yet 5%, 10%, at most 15% of people engage in it? What are the barriers? Mike, I’m going to start with you because you’ve been at this the longest Mike Boyle The biggest barrier is just life Lifestyle, kids, jobs, people thinking You really have to commit to [the time to do it} Is it getting there early? Is it going there after work? Whatever it is, it’s adding hours to your day In some ways, that’s economic People don’t have the economic freedom to say, “Hey, I can devote.” That’s why he laughs sometimes when he hears people talking about hours per week of exercise and hours per week of cardio If he can get someone to do 2 hours a week Mike thinks 75 hard minutes a week is a realistic amount of time to spend training But even 150 minutes, some of the guidelines are crazy And then there’s a lack of awareness You don’t know you’re losing the battle until it’s too late This is what he sees in his business People come in at 50, or thank God they got here now at 55 because the end for them was going to be bad Mike has been following Peter for a while, and he’s getting the message out in a way that it hasn’t gotten ot before Before the message was geeky or nichey, but it wasn’t this, “Hey, this is really good for you and this is going to make you live longer and live better. It’s a double bonus.” You want to live longer, but who wants a long, shitty life? Mike and Jeff have talked about this, and Mike has experienced 50 to 65 “I’ve experienced 50 to 65 and trust me, it’s not fun. The decline is rapid and the decline is significant.”‒ Mike Boyle If you don’t wake up by the time you’re 50, you’re going to be in real trouble by the time you’re 65 Gabrielle, how much of a difference do you see between men and women who are new to resistance training in terms of barriers to entry? “There’s nothing more important for maintaining health and wellness than taking care of muscle health.”‒ Gabrielle Lyon Whether it’s strength training, mobility resistance ‒ skeletal muscle health is really what we’re talking about Part of the disconnect from men versus women or people in general is cultural We live in a society of comfort It’s very easy to take the escalator or take an elevator When it comes to nutrition, we all have to eat, but we don’t all have to move You literally could sit at home, order groceries from Amazon Prime everything, and never had to take more than 300 steps For women, typically strength and strength training has not been the focus, even just from a standpoint of walking to the gym (you’re starting to see it more) Gabrielle feels like we are on the precipice of women recognizing the importance of strength and muscle, especially with new conversations around menopause and more potent conversations People are busy The other aspect of that is there are self-imposed limitations A woman would look at a 40 pound weight and go, “I can’t lift that.” But she would look at her 40 pound toddler and go, “I’m going to lift that and then I’m going to carry my groceries. I’ve got it.” Gabrielle makes the point, “That’s really where I think that we can change the disconnect is re-educating the importance of muscle and then also changing the cultural conversation.” Peter notices that Gabrielle is really fit. Has resistance training always been something you have enjoyed? She grew up doing it By the time she was 5, she was riding 10 miles on a bike Yes, she has always trained “With the conversation around children, if we teach them good habits now, then we don’t have to have them spend a lifetime outgrowing old habits.”‒ Gabrielle Lyon Peter is in the same boat (he’s always trained), and he suspects that true for this group One of the challenges Peter has when talking to patients who are more representative of the “real world” is that people don’t enjoy the feeling of lifting weights People say it hurts and they don’t like it Peter can appreciate the honesty, but he can’t relate It’s hard when you can’t relate to what your patient is saying He can relate when they complain about having to watch what they eat because that’s a struggle he has Do you think that that’s a function of having started early? Or do you think that there are literally just, just as we have people with different eye colors and different heights, there are truly differences in genetic hard-wiring that would speak to an individual’s appetite for that kind of discomfort? Jeff Cavaliere Jeff thinks it’s the latter There are some people who are more inclined to enjoy that type of stress For him, it doesn’t matter how much he runs, he does not enjoy the stress of running He doesn’t enjoy the feeling he gets in his lungs when he’s sucking for air He’ll do it because he knows he has to, but there’s no enjoyability about that Training hard and lifting weights and pushing himself to the utmost level of effort, that’s always been something he actually enjoys Anyone can learn to enjoy training hard and lifting weights, and you can get better at it Just like he can learn the discipline to continue to push and run when he doesn’t want to After doing it for a while, when you start to see results, the results actually might become motivating enough to go like, “Well, there is a trade-off here. I’m seeing the trade-off.” Often what’s stopping people is the perceived level of what they’re going to have to do is usually bigger than what they have to do Jeff has mentioned before that you can build a great body on 6 exercises {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Cautious optimism over lithium orotate as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is, by far, the most common cause of dementia and ranks among the most deadly diseases in the modern world. Unfortunately, in contrast to many other deadly diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and type II diabetes, the last century has seen only modest, if any, strides in AD treatment and prevention. It’s certainly not for lack of trying. An enormous volume of research has been devoted to the disease. Even as our understanding of AD clinical characteristics, pathogenesis, and risk factors has advanced over the decades, a silver bullet against this disease—akin to lipid- and blood pressure-lowering drugs for cardiovascular disease or GLP-1 receptor agonists for diabetes—has continued to elude us. But recently, researchers at Harvard Medical School generated substantial hype that such a silver bullet might in fact come in the form of a different metal—lithium. What did they find? And how does it fit within our broader understanding of the pathology and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease? Why lithium? Lithium, an alkali metal long used as a frontline treatment for bipolar disorder, is also naturally present in the brain, but the precise nature and extent of its functions are not entirely clear. In a study published last month, investigators Aron et al. sought to characterize these functions, particularly through the lens of how they might relate to the development and progression of AD.1 The authors first identified lithium as an element of interest by examining levels of an array of metals in post-mortem brain samples from humans with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or normal cognition. Of the 27 metals they analyzed, only lithium was found to be significantly lower in the prefrontal cortex (an area of the brain that is particularly affected by AD pathology) of humans with MCI or AD relative to cognitively normal controls. Further, the authors found that in all MCI and AD brain samples, lithium was highly concentrated in amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques—a classical feature of AD pathology—whereas non-plaque areas showed significantly less lithium than controls, and lithium in these non-plaque regions correlated with performance on cognitive tests conducted prior to participants’ death (i.e., lower lithium levels were associated with worse cognitive performance). Together, these results suggested that Aβ aggregation might be disrupting normal lithium distribution and utilization throughout the brain, potentially contributing to neural damage and dysfunction. Thus, the authors proceeded to conduct a series of experiments in mice to explore in depth the effects of lithium deficiency and replacement and the role that this metal might play in neurological health. In other words, is the observed effect a causal one?

This diet, which reduced lithium levels in the brain by approximately 50%, was found to result in over two-fold greater Aβ plaque deposition in AD mouse models compared to animals on a lithium-replete control diet, in addition to causing increased concentrations of pathogenic Aβ42 fragments in wild-type aged mice (which do not normally develop AD pathology). Lithium deficiency also resulted in elevated levels of phosphorylated tau protein—another typical feature of AD—in transgenic AD mice. Critically, these neuropathological features also corresponded to functional deficits, as both transgenic and wild-type mice deprived of lithium showed impairments in learning and memory tasks relative to animals on normal diets. But perhaps the greatest cause for excitement came from Aron et al.’s experiments involving lithium supplementation. By testing 16 different lithium salts, the researchers identified one in particular—lithium orotate, which they abbreviated as LiO—that exhibited significantly lower affinity for Aβ plaques than others. This, in turn, meant that LiO was more capable of raising lithium concentrations specifically in non-plaque areas of the brain, without requiring extreme doses or raising lithium levels elsewhere in the body above normal physiological ranges. (By contrast, therapeutic doses of lithium, which are much higher, are restricted to a narrow range, as this metal becomes very toxic at high levels.) In other words, for equal doses of lithium, lithium orotate raises levels of bioavailable lithium throughout the brain more than the formulation typically used in clinical settings, lithium carbonate. Thus, the authors then sought to determine whether supplementation with LiO might block the development of Aβ pathology and cognitive deficits in AD mouse models and aging wild-type mice on an otherwise normal diet (i.e., not a lithium-deficient diet). Remarkably, transgenic mice treated with a low dose of LiO through most of their adulthood (administered through drinking water for 7–9 months to achieve serum lithium levels comparable to untreated humans, in whom serum levels are approximately the same between those with and without AD) were almost completely free of Aβ plaques or aggregates of phosphorylated tau. By contrast, control animals treated with either water or an alternative lithium salt (lithium carbonate, the clinical standard for bipolar disorder) were found to have significant plaque and tau burdens, as expected for the mouse models used in this experiment. These between-group differences were also mirrored by results on cognitive function tests, in which transgenic animals treated with LiO performed comparably to cognitively normal wild-type animals on learning and memory tasks, while transgenic animals on control treatments exhibited typical deficits in these areas. Finally, the investigators also assessed the impact of LiO treatment on aging wild-type animals, and results were similarly promising. While these animals do not spontaneously develop AD neuropathological features, the authors tested other readouts of brain aging and cognitive decline—finding, for instance, that LiO reduced markers of neuroinflammation and prevented age-related losses in synaptic connections in the hippocampus (a brain region that is vital for memory). Perhaps most tellingly, aging animals treated with LiO (at levels several orders of magnitude less than doses used for human bipolar disorder) also performed significantly better than untreated controls on learning and memory tasks, nearly matching the performance level of younger animals. These results indicate that LiO can largely block age-related deficits in cognitive function, even outside of the context of Aβ plaques and other AD pathology. What this study adds… and what it doesn’t Aron et al.’s work constitutes some of the most comprehensive mechanistic data to date on the relationship between lithium and Alzheimer’s pathology, as well as on the role of lithium in the brain more generally. For example, in addition to the experiments described above, the researchers characterized how low lithium levels altered neuroinflammatory phenotypes and gene expression patterns. They also established an enzyme called glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) as a key mediator of the negative effects of lithium deficiency, demonstrating that administration of a GSK3β inhibitor blocked many of the cell- and tissue-level changes they had observed in lithium-deprived animals. However, despite the implications of many popular press articles about the study,2 the general idea that lithium might be an effective AD treatment certainly didn’t originate with Aron et al.’s findings. The neuroprotective potential of this metal, in terms of both neuropathology and cognitive performance, has been recognized for at least a quarter of a century. Several studies in animal models and cell culture from the 1990s and 2000s have established that lithium treatment can decrease Aβ and phosphorylated tau accumulation, at least in part through its capacity to act as an inhibitor of GSK3β.3–5 Chronic lithium treatment has also been shown to enhance learning and memory both in cognitively normal rodents6,7 and in various animal models of AD or other forms of cognitive impairment.8–10 The volume of evidence even includes a handful of randomized trials in humans with MCI11 or AD.12,13 Though these trials have been relatively small in scale, they have shown significant improvements in cognitive scores among participants on lithium relative to participants on placebo treatments, with no apparent concerns with respect to safety or tolerability. (In AD trials, dosages ranged from 150 mg to 600 mg to achieve target serum concentrations of 0.2-0.6 mmol/L, while the MCI trial microdosed lithium at 300 μg/day.) Indeed, the largest such trial to date—comprising 80 adults with MCI randomized to lithium or placebo for a treatment period of two years—was recently completed, and results are expected to be published in this coming winter.14 A better formulation for future trials Given this wealth of evidence and ongoing research, Aron et al.’s study starts to look far less revolutionary. But while it’s true that most of the findings praised in mainstream media have in fact been known for many years, this work does indeed substantially advance the field in a way that is perhaps less attention-grabbing—but nonetheless powerful. Investigations on the efficacy of lithium for AD or MCI treatment have thus far (including the recently completed MCI trial) focused on the standard formulation used for treating bipolar disorder: lithium carbonate. As mentioned above, these studies have shown statistically significant benefits for cognition and neuropathology with this treatment relative to placebo, but in absolute terms, the effects were fairly modest—enough to maintain research interest in lithium as a therapeutic strategy, but not enough to generate much excitement that it could be the silver bullet we’ve been waiting for. But according to Aron et al., lithium carbonate barely scratches the surface of lithium’s therapeutic capacity, as animals on this treatment barely differed from water-treated mice in most outcomes tested. The investigators found that alternative lithium salts—particularly lithium orotate—are far more capable of avoiding sequestration in Aβ aggregates and correcting low bioavailability of lithium in the rest of the brain (while still maintaining total lithium concentrations in normal physiological ranges)—and are thus more effective in eliciting improvements in cognitive and neuropathological trajectories. If these results are eventually found to translate to humans, just think how the modest benefits observed with lithium carbonate might be magnified in future trials with lithium orotate. While research to date has focused on lithium carbonate and has struggled with low efficacy and high toxicity, we now see that we can potentially circumvent both of those problems simply by using a different salt (!!). In other words, Aron et al.’s work might someday prove to be revolutionary after all—not because it was the first to establish lithium as a potential therapy for AD or MCI, but because the researchers took the extra time to consider how to maximize the therapeutic potential of this simple metal. (However, it’s worth noting that the potential for LiO to reduce age-related cognitive decline—that is, in the absence of AD pathology—to an equal or greater extent than lithium carbonate is less convincing at present, as this study did not compare the two formulations for these outcomes.) Keeping perspective on practical implications These results suggest that simply by changing the specific lithium salt used for supplementation, we can significantly increase lithium’s efficacy as a treatment for AD. In light of these data—and given the very low cost of lithium salts—early-stage clinical trials with LiO are likely forthcoming. But in the meantime, we’d be remiss not to point out a few important limitations with regard to the practical applicability of these findings. First, none of the experiments in this study (or in any clinical trials to date) were designed to assess whether lithium is effective in preventing AD or MCI. While this study did not conduct pre-treatment assessments, we can safely assume that AD pathology would have existed even at baseline, as earlier research has shown that the transgenic mice used in this study start developing AD neuropathology and cognitive deficits by adolescence—younger than the age at which lithium treatment was initiated in these experiments.15,16 Thus, nothing in this study indicates that taking lithium pre-emptively—i.e., outside of the context of existing neurodegenerative disease—would provide any benefit for cognitive trajectories. (Although such a benefit is theoretically possible, we have no evidence of it at present.) Indeed, even if we did have evidence for an effect on AD prevention, this wouldn’t mean that everyone should run out to the drug store and start taking lithium orotate supplements. Lithium—regardless of its salt formulation—is acutely toxic at high doses and can cause chronic toxicity, particularly to the kidneys, even at doses within typical therapeutic ranges. No form of lithium should ever be taken without oversight by a medical professional, and with respect to LiO in particular, we have very little safety data at present, and what little we have comes from studies in rodents, not humans. This also means that we have no insight on which patients (if any) are most likely to benefit, which side effects might exist, or what protocols to use with regard to reasonable dosages, frequency, or duration of treatment. In other words, it would be very premature to add lithium orotate to any plan for AD prevention or treatment in humans. A cause for [cautious] optimism Few diseases have defied searches for effective treatments to quite the same extent as Alzheimer’s disease, and it’s far too early to crown lithium orotate as the answer to our prayers. Many stumbling blocks exist on the road from animals to humans, particularly where AD is concerned, as AD mouse models—which involve genetic manipulations to produce pathological features that don’t occur naturally in mice—don’t precisely replicate the pathogenesis and progression of spontaneous AD in humans. Even if LiO does prove to be an effective human treatment, most experts agree that treating (let alone curing) this complex disease will likely require more than any single therapy can achieve on its own. Rather, it may demand a multipronged approach aimed at various clinical features and pathogenic mechanisms. But in light of the long history of data suggesting lithium as a possible AD treatment, paired with the apparent improvements to this therapeutic strategy that Aron et al. demonstrated with lithium orotate, we have plenty of cause for cautious optimism. Indeed, the fact that many of the present study’s results had already been shown shouldn’t dampen our hopes over these findings—it should strengthen them. Lithium has long been on the radar as a potential AD therapy, but virtually every game-changing advance in medicine could never have been possible without many incremental steps, a number of false leads, and a few key “aha” moments along the way. Whether this present work will prove to be incremental, misguided, or “aha” remains to be proven more definitively, but the data from Aron et al. provide a very compelling rationale for further investigation of LiO as an AD treatment—potentially turning a risky therapy with ho-hum benefits into a highly efficacious therapy with a lower risk profile. I hope that researchers will answer the call for clinical trials in the near future—because in the case of AD, even moderately effective treatments would be a welcome breakthrough, “silver bullet” or not.

      "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter explores how to determine the right diet for yourself rather than searching for a universal “best” diet. He begins by laying out five non-negotiable criteria that any sustainable eating pattern must meet—energy balance, metabolic health, adequate protein, micronutrient sufficiency, and long-term adherence—before introducing a practical rubric for evaluating different diets. Using this framework, Peter walks through the ketogenic, carnivore, vegan, and Mediterranean diets, highlighting their strengths, ideal candidates for each, and common pitfalls such as micronutrient gaps or adherence challenges. He explains why this guidance is aimed at people who feel overwhelmed by diet choices, not zealots defending a single approach, and provides practical advice on using tools like DEXA scans, lab markers, continuous glucose monitors, and symptom tracking to assess whether a diet is truly working.

Show Notes Peter’s family chess battle [A: 3:00, V: 1:27] Quick chess update (See AMA #74 for previous chess talk): Peter’s family had an “in-house” chess tournament this weekend Peter made it to the finals with his youngest boy Peter was playing lights out until he made an idiotic blunder, and in a second, the game changed. Five moves later, it’s checkmate against Peter Nick pokes fun at Peter commenting: “You started this by bragging about making it to the finals of an in-house chess tournament which was composed of three people. . .two of which can’t even drive yet.” Peter claims there were more than 3 people: “No, no, no. There were a few others. There were some other people in the tournament.” Thankfully, Peter restrained himself and didn’t throw any pieces across the room Framing the diet discussion: moving past tribalism to practical frameworks for evaluating various dietary strategies [A: 5:00, V: 3:45] Framing of the Episode Focus is not on which diet is “best,” but on how to evaluate diets pragmatically. This episode aims to help people navigate the overwhelming information on diets. The structure of the discussion: Start with five non-negotiables for any sustainable diet: 1) Energy balance 2) Metabolic health 3) Adequacy of protein 4) Micronutrient sufficiency 5) Long-term adherence Use a framework for each diet: Define the rules clearly Identify strengths and who it suits best Highlight weaknesses and pitfalls, plus how to mitigate them Apply the framework to four common diets: ketogenic, carnivore, vegan, and Mediterranean. End with practical takeaways for implementation and tracking progress. Peter’s Reluctance and Motivation Peter admits he generally dislikes discussing diets because: Conversations often degrade into tribal, moral, or religious-like arguments rather than scientific discourse. He dislikes the fanaticism in diet culture. He was reluctant to record this episode but was convinced by: Audience demand. His team, especially Josh Roche, who framed it as targeting the 87% of confused, non-zealot individuals who just want clarity and practical guidance. Key mental shift: focus on the majority of people seeking common-sense frameworks, not extremists in dietary “camps.” Nutrition vs. Diets Distinction Peter makes: Previous Nutrition AMA (AMA #66 released in Dec. 2024) covered big-picture topics: Is there a “best” diet? Nutrition vs. exercise in health outcomes. Protein requirements for maintenance vs. muscle growth. This episode focuses on dietary approaches themselves, their frameworks, and practical decision-making. Intention is to bridge the gap between nutritional biochemistry (his preference) and diet strategy/application (audience demand).

      "title": "Preventing seasonal declines in vitamin D with exercise",
      "content": "With autumn and winter approaching, those of us in the northern hemisphere can reliably count on certain seasonal changes: lower temperatures, shorter days, and with the reduced sunlight, a decline in our levels of circulating vitamin D. Vitamin D is utilized by nearly every tissue in the body, exerting essential effects for various processes such as maintaining bone and immune health. But despite the importance of this molecule, many people have insufficient levels, especially in winter. While some may turn to sun lamps or vitamin D supplements to combat deficiency, researchers Perkin et al. recently examined whether a different intervention—namely, cardiorespiratory exercise—might help to prevent the decline in vitamin D levels typically seen in winter months.1 Vitamin D: the role of sunlight and fat mass Those who have listened to our previous AMA on sun exposure will know that ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun provide a powerful source of vitamin D, as they stimulate the skin to convert a vitamin D precursor (7-dehydrocholesterol) into D3, which is subsequently converted through additional steps to the active form of vitamin D: 1,25-(OH)₂D.2 Indeed, UV light is such a strong stimulator of vitamin D production that those with lighter skin tones only need about nine minutes of sunlight over about one third of the body’s surface area to meet their daily vitamin D requirements—at least in the summer months, when sunlight to the northern hemisphere is most direct.3 In the winter months, however, weaker and shorter periods of sunlight, combined with added layers of clothing reducing skin exposure to sunlight, can lead to a D3 deficiency, particularly for those living at higher latitudes. The situation is typically even worse for those with excess fat mass. Since vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin, circulating vitamin D tends to become sequestered in adipose tissue, such that individuals with excess adiposity have even less vitamin D available for use throughout the body. This has been reported to translate to a nearly 75% higher risk of vitamin D deficiency among individuals with obesity relative to those with normal BMIs,4 and even supplementation has been shown to have a blunted effect in those with more adipose tissue.5 But what if we could mobilize more vitamin D out of those fat stores? Exercise—even when it doesn’t result in net weight loss—is known to stimulate lipolysis (i.e., the breakdown of fat), and thus, Perkin et al. hypothesized that the lipolysis achieved with exercise could release more vitamin D into circulation.1 Our research team spends hundreds of hours each month vetting studies and distilling dense literature to deliver evidence-informed insights on health and longevity.

The exercise intervention involved four cardiovascular exercise sessions per week at an indoor gym: two treadmill walking sessions and two exercise bike sessions, one at steady state and one composed of low-volume high intensity intervals. The intensity and duration of the exercise was tailored to individual fitness levels and adjusted throughout the study, with each of the exercises designed to meet a pre-determined energy expenditure per session (12 kJ/kg progressing to 15 kJ/kg). By contrast, the control group was instructed to make no changes to their baseline lifestyle (thus, any changes in vitamin D would presumably be due to seasonal declines). The study took place during winter months in the UK, and all participants were prohibited from taking vitamin D supplements during the study period and were required to maintain their baseline body weight. (This was achieved through increased caloric intake to match the added energy expenditure, but diet was monitored via food diary to ensure vitamin D intake did not increase from baseline.) Together, these parameters were intended to isolate the effect of exercise itself, without additional impacts from any changes in body weight, diet, or sun exposure. What they found At baseline, both groups exhibited comparable levels of both the bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25-(OH)₂D₃, and an intermediate form, 25-(OH)D (found in adipose tissue and the primary form in circulation). Specifically, baseline levels of the active form were around 100 pmol/L on average between groups, while 25-(OH)D levels averaged just over 50 nmol/L. While the bioactive form does not have defined ranges or thresholds for deficiency, it’s worth noting that the average baseline 25-(OH)D level was just above the threshold for insufficiency (defined as <50 nmol/L) and roughly double the threshold for outright deficiency (defined as <25 nmol/L), meaning that nearly half of all participants met criteria for vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency at the start of the study. By the end of the study—that is, after 10 weeks of winter in the UK—the control group had experienced a 15% decline in circulating bioactive vitamin D, while the exercise group maintained baseline levels. The average difference between the two groups at the end of the study period was 14.4 pmol/L (95% CI: 0.5–26.8 pmol/L), which translates to a moderate effect size (though the effect was quite variable between individuals). Meanwhile, levels of the intermediate form of vitamin D also dropped significantly from baseline in the control group but not the exercise group, though the between-group difference in this case was just shy of reaching statistical significance (P=0.07). (Any changes in the concentration of other forms of vitamin D, including various metabolites of vitamin D, were not significantly different between groups.) These findings suggest that exercise can blunt the seasonal decline in vitamin D status, particularly for the active form of the molecule that has the greatest influence on cellular function. What questions remain open? While these results add to the mountain of evidence supporting the many benefits of exercise, several important questions with respect to the scope and implications of these findings remain unanswered. We must keep in mind that the study population was limited to individuals with overweight and obesity, many of whom already met the criteria for vitamin D insufficiency at baseline. Given that vitamin D sequesters in fat tissue and that individuals with obesity often exhibit adipose tissue dysfunction,6 it’s possible that lean individuals would experience greater or lesser effects than those with obesity. The relationship between adiposity and vitamin D metabolism is complex, and thus extrapolating these findings to different body composition profiles requires caution. Additionally, this study was unable to show clear evidence of their hypothesized mechanism—i.e., that exercise enhanced vitamin D release from fat stores. While previous studies have shown transient increases in serum vitamin D after exercise,7 in the present 10-week study, both groups showed decreases in vitamin D in subcutaneous adipose tissue, with no significant differences between exercise and control interventions (though the exercise group trended toward greater losses). Exercise has numerous physiological effects, so it’s possible that other mechanisms might also be at play (e.g., changes in the conversion rate of the storage form of vitamin D to the active form), which in turn might inform the best strategies for utilizing exercise to combat seasonal vitamin D decline. (This study focused exclusively on moderate cardio exercise, but it’s possible that the metabolic adaptations associated with resistance training or higher- or lower-intensity cardio training might offer additional benefits.) What does this leave us with? Despite the lack of change from baseline in the bioactive form of vitamin D, those in the exercise group still exhibited some losses in other vitamin D forms and metabolites over the course of the study, suggesting that exercise is unlikely to prevent the seasonal decline in vitamin D alone. However, it may be an important adjunct to vitamin D supplementation and dietary sources, especially for those who are at higher risk for deficiency, such as those with excess adiposity or darker skin tones. (Melanin naturally reduces the amount of vitamin D produced from UV exposure, making winter vitamin D maintenance more challenging for these populations.) The bottom line These data don’t negate the importance of vitamin D supplementation, particularly for those with documented deficiency or insufficiency. (While the “optimal range” of vitamin D is still debated—see the scrutinizing supplements AMA—generally speaking, you will want to shoot for around 50 ng/mL, with anything above 80 ng/mL considered excessive.) Instead, this research suggests that exercise could serve as a valuable complementary strategy, and may even be sufficient on its own to prevent seasonal declines among those who are at relatively low risk—such as those with fairer skin or at lower latitudes, where sunlight isn’t in such short supply in winter. But in a larger sense, this simply adds yet another compelling reason to maintain regular exercise during winter months. Beyond the well-established benefits for cardiovascular health, metabolic function, and mental well-being, exercise may also help preserve vitamin D, providing yet another reason to prioritize physical activity year-round.

Show Notes The evolution of neurosurgery and the shift toward minimally invasive techniques [A: 2:30, V: 1:17] There’s so much Peter wants to talk about with respect to Edward’s career, the field of neurosurgery today, and how the bounds are really being pushed Neurosurgery remains a little bit of a black box What were the typical problems that would’ve presented to a neurosurgeon in the latter part of the 19th century, and what were the tools they had at their disposal? We’re speaking after the development of anesthesia It’s a very small group of physicians that are taking care of fairly severe indications It’s a rarefied field that requires very long training in addition If we go back 100 years, we’re talking about the era of Harvey Cushing who’s considered the father of modern neurosurgery That was a clear inflection point in the history of medicine, in the history of neuroscience, and the history of neurosurgery It was really the beginning of what we’d call the modern neurosurgery Cushing was a really an astute observer, an incredibly technically skilled surgeon, and also an incredible internist He diagnosed some of the first pituitary tumors and the effects of those on endocrine function This was the era of modern tools of craniotomy Opening the skull to get access to brain tumors and everything followed since then ⇒ The main categories of neurosurgery have to do with tumors, the vascular system (which are aneurysms and strokes and blood clot), the spine, and then probably the most recent one is the one we call “functional” Functional neurosurgery has to do with understanding the functions of brain circuit but also intervening to change how they work using deep brain stimulation or other ablation methods Harvey Cushing would be credited for the development of the electrocautery It’s hard to imagine you could operate without one of those It’s the key of controlling bleeding in any surgery, but particularly in the brain (it’s a tricky thing) Harvey Cushing was just the starting point of modern neurosurgery Then there’s Wilder Penfield He who was an American but really did some incredible work in creating the Montreal Neurological Institute, and that was really the beginning of what we would consider modern epilepsy surgery Surgeries that are designed to stop people from having seizures He popularized this thing that we all learn in medical school called the homunculus [shown in the figure below] It’s this picture of the little man there and essentially the part of our brain that controls every muscle in our body and how it’s laid out in that particular part of the brain It’s something that we all learn Figure 1. Homunculus. Image credit: Evidence-Based Medicine Consult He was also a brilliant scientist who helped us understand some of the basic things that we know about language and, from a technical perspective, really popularized and developed the concept of awake brain surgery Awake brain surgery is really something that’s captivated Edward since medical school and what he specializes in now Fast forward to the ‘70s and ‘80s, what was state of the art 40, 50 years ago with respect to vascular management, oncologic management of masses in the brain relative to today? What were the plateaus in technology? Some of the things that we do now are almost identical to the way that Cushing did it over 100 years ago, and then some of it is radically different One of the workhorse surgeries that we do is called a craniotomy That basically means where you remove a piece of bone temporarily (you replace it at the end of the procedure) to access something like a brain tumor that’s in the frontal or a temporal lobe That’s still being performed today and still really indicated But where we are now, there’s ways of using laser probes through very small incisions to get to deep targets in the brain to ablate them There are ways of now even using focus ultrasound that can be targeted to specific nuclei in deep parts of the brain in order to control someone’s tremor for example This is what we would consider a relatively non-invasive approach to do a neurosurgery ‒ so things have changed radically One other area where we have seen tremendous disruption is in the vascular neurosurgery field Back in the ‘80s and ‘90s, you’d have a large craniotomy and incision probably about 7-9 inches long, removal of a piece of bone and then using an operative microscope to dissect down to the deepest parts where the blood vessels are coming to fix, let’s say, an aneurysm An aneurysm is essentially a ballooning of a blood vessel that when it ruptures, can be fatal That is a lot of what Edward trained on ⇒ Nowadays, 90% of those procedures are now done through a catheter in the groin that’s visualized We put coils into the aneurysms to help secure them We can now do stents ‒ a huge change now being able to retrieve and dissolve clots that are causing acute severe strokes Probably the most dramatic things that we’ve seen Someone comes in, not able to talk, paralyzed on half side of the body In the old days, we would just give some medications keeping our fingers crossed that that would work It rarely worked; it was really the minority of cases that it helped Nowadays, there’s a much bigger fraction of patients where you can put the device in and retrieve the stroke These are really game-changing things when someone can go home the next day after such a huge thing We’re starting to see things like stroke become more like heart attacks The cath labs are not just treating heart attacks but they’re also treating what we call “brain attacks” or strokes Some things are relatively similar to 100 years ago and then some things have just been totally changed If 30 years ago, a neurosurgeon was doing a craniotomy virtually every time they were addressing a pathology, today it might be less than half the time? Yeah, that’s right Peter notices that’s not a dissimilar parallel to what we see in other parts of surgery He was just talking to a vascular surgeon a couple of weeks ago who finished his training around the time Peter did and Peter asked, “How many open surgical procedures are you doing?” Peter was talking about AAAs and all sorts of Fem-Pops and things like that He said it’s virtually all done with stents… even carotid arteries, the whole thing Peter was really blown away at how little they’re operating now in an open sense What’s happened with surgery is the force of evolution is guiding us towards things that are more minimally invasive, with less collateral damage to get to the targets and get people back to life sooner “It’s a very exciting time, actually, to be in medicine with all this technology that’s coming on board.”‒ Edward Chang Glioblastomas: biology, current treatments, and emerging strategies to overcome its challenges [A: 10:45, V: 10:58] Whenever Peter thinks of the brain, he thinks of GBMs (these awful tumors) Tell folks what a GBM is, and why a GBM is truly one of the cancers that gives cancer a bad name {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Can extreme calorie restriction enhance human lifespan?",
      "content": "Caloric restriction (CR) has fascinated longevity researchers for decades, with species from yeast to primates showing extended lifespans under CR. But important questions remain. How exactly does CR work? Does meal timing matter, or is it simply about total intake? And how much do our genes influence the benefits? These aren’t just academic curiosities. For anyone aiming to live longer and healthier, they get at the heart of a practical question: should we all be practicing extreme CR? A large-scale study in mice, published in Nature last October, takes us closer to some answers.1 By directly comparing CR with intermittent fasting (IF) in a genetically diverse population of mice, the study offers one of the most detailed looks yet at how diet and genetics interact to shape both lifespan and healthspan. The results reaffirm that extreme CR can extend lifespan in a controlled lab setting—but they also make clear why it’s unlikely to be the most promising path for extending human life. The lifespan-extending effects of CR To test how different dietary patterns influence both healthspan and lifespan—and to probe possible mechanisms behind caloric restriction’s effects—researchers Di Francesco et al. tested nearly 1,000 genetically diverse female mice over their natural lifespans. Their goal was to directly compare the lifespan-extending effects of CR, in which total available food was limited, with IF, in which food is withheld entirely for designated periods before resuming normal eating. By examining both approaches in a genetically varied population, the researchers set the stage for a comprehensive look into the impacts of not only caloric intake, but also meal timing and genetic background. At six months of age—roughly equivalent to 30 years of age for humans—the mice were assigned to one of five groups: Control: unlimited food access 20% CR: 20% fewer calories than baseline 40% CR: 40% fewer calories than baseline IF 1 day/week: one day of fasting each week IF 2 days/week: two days of fasting each week Results revealed a dose–response relationship between calorie restriction and longevity: the greater the sustained calorie reduction, the greater the lifespan extension. Mice on a 20% calorie restriction lived 18.2% longer than controls, while those on 40% restriction had the largest gain—a 36.3% increase in median lifespan. This relationship was even more striking for maximum lifespan: the longest-lived mice in the 20% CR group lived 22.3% longer than their control counterparts, and the 40% CR group lived an astounding 38.4% longer. The intermittent fasting groups also experienced some benefit—mice fasting one day per week had a median lifespan 11.8% longer than controls, and those fasting two days per week saw a 10.6% increase, suggesting that this pattern of eating may also extend lifespan, though to a lesser extent than sustained calorie restriction. Again, the pattern was echoed in maximal lifespan, for which one-day fasting group saw a 6.2% increase relative to controls, and the two-day fasting group saw a 14.9% increase. However, it’s critical to note that gains observed in the IF groups coincided with unplanned calorie restriction, as IF mice did not fully compensate for fasting days with increased calorie intake on feeding days. The two-day fasting group, for example, consumed about 12% fewer calories overall than controls, suggesting that their longevity benefit may have been due as much to reduced total intake as to fasting itself. (CR groups also experienced a degree of IF, since the 40% CR group tended to consume most of their allotted weekend food within one day after it was provided on Friday afternoons—resulting in about 1.5 days without food—and the 20% CR group tended to consume most of their allotted weekend food within two days—resulting in about 0.5 days without food.) This observation, combined with the findings that CR protocols had significantly greater impact on lifespan than IF protocols, indicates that calorie restriction itself—not simply the timing of meals—was the dominant factor in extending life.

And if so, at what cost? A 40% caloric restriction in humans would mean dropping from a 2,000-calorie diet to just 1,200 calories—indefinitely—a level that is both physiologically taxing and socially impractical. Even in the most rigorous, long-term human CR study to date, the CALERIE trial, participants aimed for a 25% reduction but managed only about half of that.2 Likewise, two days of IF per week might seem to some like an achievable feeding pattern, but because mice have much faster metabolisms and shorter lifespans than humans, this two-day period in mice would be more akin to two weeks of fasting in people—a far greater physiological challenge that most would find impossible. These gaps underscore the difference between what can be achieved in a tightly controlled laboratory study and what is realistic in daily life. But even if we pretend that such extreme interventions were more feasible for your average human, the results of this study raise questions about whether certain negative consequences of CR might compromise potential lifespan benefits in a “real-world” setting. The 40% CR group may have lived the longest, but their added years came with significant losses in lean body mass and marked shifts in immune cell composition that Di Francesco et al. note might “confer susceptibility to infection.” In the protected environment of a laboratory where risk of injury and infection are minimized, such changes may have little consequence for lifespan. However, in the real world, they could mean reduced resilience, slower recovery from illness, or greater vulnerability to infections—all of which can be deadly for older humans. IF groups also showed concerning physiological changes. For instance, two-day IF resulted in disruptions in red blood cell characteristics, including an increase in red blood cell distribution width—a significant negative predictor of lifespan in this study that potentially reflects subtle but meaningful stresses on blood and oxygen transport. Of note, red blood cell distribution width measure in humans is also associated with higher risk of mortality and chronic disease.3 These results make one thing clear: while extreme CR can push lifespan to new heights in mice, the accompanying costs raise serious questions about whether it can ever be a viable path for humans. The more practical role for CR in humans may be how many apply it already: as a way to prevent gradual gains in adiposity over time through adherence to mild CR, rather than utilizing dramatic, sustained reductions in calories. Extreme CR, by contrast, may be better reserved for research settings as a tool for exploring the fundamental biology of aging—by identifying the pathways through which CR exerts its effects, scientists may uncover possibilities for safer, more targeted interventions. The bottom line Extreme calorie restriction can clearly extend lifespan in mice, but the trade-offs, risks, and impracticality make it an unlikely tool for extending human life. Its greatest value is as a research model for increasing our collective understanding of the biology of aging itself—an endeavor that someday might lead to more promising and practical lifespan-extending interventions. Of course, this isn’t to say that diet has no place in efforts to achieve a longer and healthier life. As a smaller element of their study, Di Francesco et al. investigated how diet patterns stacked up against genetics in determining lifespan. They found that although genetics accounted for more variability in lifespan than diet assignment, the relative influence of diet increased as animals got older—suggesting that the dietary choices we make throughout our lives gradually accrue into increasingly significant impacts on lifespan. Indeed, while extreme CR and IF may be unsustainable and come with downsides for body composition and immune function, more moderate engagement in these dietary strategies can be very effective in preventing excess fat accumulation and avoiding metabolic dysfunction, which in turn affects risk for several chronic diseases. (For those interested, I discussed the pros and cons of various fasting protocols in depth in a recent AMA.) So despite substantial doubt about the utility of extreme CR for human lifespan extension, there’s no question that diet—along with other lifestyle factors such as exercise, sleep habits, and stress management—remains a critical lever for promoting not just a longer life, but a healthier one.

      "title": "Oldies-But-Goodies, August 2025 Edition",
      "content": "This week, I’m sharing another collection of oldies-but-goodies—pieces from our newsletter archive that address a variety of topics of continued interest to our audience. Some provide additional context for recent or upcoming content; some address frequently asked questions; and some are simply worth repeating for anyone who might have missed them. The world of biomedical science is constantly evolving, but in evaluating what has changed, we like to pause now and then to acknowledge information and ideas that have remained relevant despite the passage of time—a celebration of “aging well,” if you will. Concerning findings on melatonin content in over-the-counter supplements With the lazy days of summer winding down, many of us—especially those with school-aged kids—find we have more stressors and demands on our time (and wallets) as we head into the fall and the looming holiday season. Under these circumstances, getting sufficient, high-quality sleep can be more challenging, prompting some to turn to melatonin supplements for a little extra help. But as we discussed in this newsletter from two years ago, such “natural” sleep aids drastically exceed the doses that the body naturally produces to promote sleep, and it’s possible that regular, long-term exposure to high concentrations of this sleep hormone may gradually impair endogenous production and/or reduce the brain’s sensitivity to melatonin signaling. While these supplements can help to mitigate certain acute disruptions to sleep schedules—such as when experiencing jet lag or after a single night with too much screen time—they should not be considered a long-term, everyday solution for sleep concerns. (For information on more sustainable strategies for improving sleep, check out my recent podcast with Dr. Ashley Mason.) Can treating hearing loss improve cognitive trajectories and reduce dementia risk? Age-related hearing loss is strongly associated with dementia, though debate continues as to whether this relationship may be causal or if hearing loss might merely be an early biomarker of deterioration in cognitive function. The ACHIEVE randomized trial, published in 2023, attempted to address this question by examining whether correcting hearing loss might slow or prevent cognitive decline, reporting no significant differences in cognitive trajectories between treated and untreated groups.1 Yet as we describe in this newsletter covering the study, a number of limitations in the study’s methodology and results meant that the door had not completely closed on the possibility that hearing loss might be directly detrimental to cognitive function. Indeed, in the time since we wrote this piece, several secondary analyses of ACHIEVE data have shown that the treatment group experienced significant improvements relative to controls in various outcomes, including communicative function,2 fall risk,3 and social network size.4 These outcomes could plausibly relate to certain aspects of cognitive or neurological health, but more importantly, even if they represent distinct effects, they underscore an inescapable conclusion: whether or not hearing loss contributes causally to cognitive decline (as I still suspect it does), correcting hearing deficits offers so many other benefits to overall health and well-being as to make it a no-brainer choice for anyone looking to enjoy a longer, happier life.

But in the case of this piece from November 2023, we have a rare opportunity to draw fresh attention to concepts that continue to grow in significance with the passage of time—namely, the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) for improving evaluation of medical data and assessment of an individual’s health risks. The study discussed in this newsletter focused on the use of AI to facilitate analysis of raw image data from body composition scans—a strategy which, when it came to predicting mortality, significantly outperformed the traditional, human-driven practice of analyzing a handful of numerical metrics extracted from the [much richer] images.5 But as exciting as this application may have been in 2023, it’s impossible to deny that the last two years have seen greater advances in AI’s analytical and reasoning capacities than most of us could have thought possible. So in revisiting the success of AI in this early domain and seeing how the technology has progressed since then, we can perhaps begin to conceptualize just how powerfully AI may yet reshape the capabilities of modern medicine (and countless other fields). A study comparing the effects of vegan and omnivorous diets fails Science 101 It’s no secret that nutrition is one of my least favorite topics, and the reason for this is two-fold: 1) the sheer volume of bad science published in this space is staggering, and 2) the fact that many tend to defend their diet with such cultish zeal that any hope for critical, fact-driven analysis is lost. These problems often go hand-in-hand—as appeared to be the case with the study and docuseries on which this newsletter was based.6 In a soon-to-be-released “Ask Me Anything” episode, I explain how to assess the relative merits and shortcomings of various diet patterns from a health perspective and how to determine which approach might be right for you as an individual. However, this type of critical evaluation is only possible if we first open our eyes to the pervasiveness of diet tribalism and the flawed research that is so often used to support any given camp’s sense of superiority over others. Thus, prior to the upcoming AMA, I recommend revisiting this newsletter, which was largely intended to illustrate how biased study designs and appeals to emotion can (and often are) used inappropriately to manipulate public perspectives on the role of diet in human health.

      "title": "#362 ‒ Understanding anxiety: defining, assessing, and treating health anxiety, OCD, and the spectrum of anxiety disorders | Josh Spitalnick, Ph.D., A.B.P.P.",
      "content": "Josh Spitalnick is a clinical and research psychologist with expertise in treating a variety of anxiety conditions with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based approaches. In this episode, Josh unpacks the four layers of anxiety—psychological, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral—highlighting why avoidance is the key feature that transforms ordinary worry into disorder. He explains why he continues to treat OCD and PTSD as anxiety conditions despite their DSM-5 reclassification, and he draws important distinctions between worries versus worrying and thoughts versus thinking. The discussion explores health anxiety, illness anxiety, and the impact of modern contributors such as wearables, social media, and the COVID era, while weaving in real-world case studies and Josh’s structured assessment approach. Josh also breaks down evidence-based treatments, from exposure therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), along with the role of medication, lifestyle factors, and how shifting from avoidance to committed action can build long-term resilience.

Show Notes Josh’s professional background and his holistic approach to treating anxiety [A: 3:00, V: 1:19] We’re going to talk about anxiety broadly and probably get into a specific subset of anxiety, which is around health anxiety, something that people like Peter are probably contributing to in some form or another It’s not something Peter wants to be doing, but inevitably it becomes a two-edged sword As you probe deeper into health, you end up doing this The term anxiety is so broad, but before we talk about that let’s start with your background What is it that you do in your practice? Who do you work with? Josh is a licensed psychologist He’s board certified in behavioral and cognitive psychology He spends a significant amount of time focusing on how people think, how people act This includes how we can address their deficits and improve them to make their lives better At the end of the day, he’s a therapist His career has had many stages, and he’s spent most of the last 15 years focusing on anxiety conditions Anxiety has many layers It’s a very physical experience, very physical, physiological It’s an emotional experience There are cognitive elements to it (how we think) Ultimately, the way we judge each other and how we see each other is the behavioral experience, so we see what people do and don’t do An anxiety specialist is someone who really addresses all of those domains of functioning: how we physically, emotionally, cognitively, and behaviorally act in our own world and in relation to others Definition of anxiety and changes in the DSM-5 [A: 5:00, V: 3:19] Changes in the DSM-5 around anxiety disorders Is there a DSM-5 criteria that you refer to or do you think about something that goes deeper and/or broader than what the DSM would have to say about anxiety? The DSM-5 altered anxiety disorders We’re probably going to be seeing the DSM-6 in a few years, and it’ll be interesting to see what it does. In the last iteration of the DSM, it actually pulled 2 pretty prominent anxiety disorders out of the anxiety disorders It moved PTSD out of the anxiety disorders and it moved OCD out of the anxiety disorders Josh shares, “I don’t believe for one second that they’re not anxiety disorders. They’re anxiety disorders, but because of some special elements about them, some people much wiser than me and you decided that they should be in their own special categories.” Those 2 disorders specifically have some interesting elements to them and he understands why you’d want to separate them out When Josh thinks about interventions The intervention sometimes dictates the disorder This is maybe a reverse order for how physicians are trained or how even some therapists are trained That may not be the most popular thing to say Most of the interventions we’re going to probably talk about today are going to be some version of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and some version of exposure-based therapy Those are 2 of the leading interventions They are gold standard or first-line treatments of choice for almost any anxiety disorder of the 8-9 [types] that he likes to refer to Anxiety is a loose category ⇒ For Josh, anxiety simply means that someone is emotionally, physically, cognitively, behaviorally, internally preoccupied with something that’s concerning them, and then undeniably they’re doing something about it (often doing the wrong thing) As an anxiety specialist and as someone who runs a large practice (he gets 1000s of referrals a year), he’s always tickled that his practice thrives because amongst all the anxiety disorders, they share one common symptom: avoidance He’ll talk about their different symptoms and criteria later Avoidance is the thread between all of them that identifies when we have someone who has worries, physiological anxiety, cognitive anxiety, behavioral anxiety When Josh starts seeing avoidance, we’re now going from someone that has a worry state to something that’s probably more problematic ⇒ There’s many versions of avoidance, but avoidance is a behavioral coping tool that’s highly effective in the moment for the anxiety, but ineffective long-term for functioning, that is shared amongst almost all the anxiety disorders ⇒ Anxiety is how people are thinking mostly about the future, how they’re feeling about their future, how they’re anticipating the future We start talking about anticipatory anxiety, risk calculations, worrying about something that’s going to happen (catastrophizing, plotting and planning), and then acting in advance of that Josh points out that Peter has built an amazing career in medicine around planning 30, 40 years in advance But the anxious person is using that in a way, they’re weaponizing that fortune-telling in a very unhealthy way, and it’s ruining their lives If avoidance, which you’re describing as an action, is the sine qua non of all forms of anxiety, is the corollary of that a worry or distressed thought about the future absent a behavioral avoidance doesn’t cross the threshold of anxiety and therefore is not necessarily “pathologic”? The short answer is yes ⇒ The DSM at its core is about dysfunction In every category of disorder in the DSM, from schizophrenia to medically-induced disorders, cancer-induced depression to post-traumatic stress and OCD, if there’s no dysfunction in life (that’s usually relationships, occupational functioning, social functioning, educational functioning), if we don’t see problematic behaviors in someone’s life → then they have worries, they have sadness So someone who is sad, who’s not feeling great, but they’re not acting in ways aligned with depression, it’s hard to diagnose them with some version of a depressive disorder If someone is not engaging in behaviors in advance of trying to eliminate the distress, the uncertainty, the concerns about what’s up ahead, then Josh has a hard time diagnosing someone with a disorder Josh is a national OCD specialist, he’s a national OCD treater and trainer for the International OCD Foundation He’s a national health anxiety specialist If someone is not evidencing compulsions or rituals (which is one part of OCD, the other part is obsessions), it’s hard for him to diagnose someone who’s doing nothing to mitigate or manage those distressing thoughts, if what they’re doing in turn is living their fullest life Updates from the DSM-4 to DSM-5 changed that “dysfunction” criteria {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Determining optimal protein intake from data, not dogmatism",
      "content": "Tension has been brewing in the world of nutrition. The subject of the dispute? Protein—or more precisely, protein requirements, and journalists, scientists, government officials, and health influencers are all weighing in. I’m certainly no stranger to the fray, having discussed on numerous occasions my belief (and the research behind it) that the US Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is too low for optimizing health. In fact, some news outlets have cast me as a “poster man” for this position,1 though I’m clearly not alone. The sheer variety of protein-fortified foods that have made their way onto grocery store shelves attests to the growing number of individuals seeking to increase their intake of this macronutrient. Yet this trend has prompted some backlash. Many in mainstream media and social media have denounced the protein boom as a “marketing scam,” claiming that the RDA is sufficient for most individuals and warning against alleged dangers of high-protein diets.2 As we often see in nutrition, proponents of these opposing positions typically express their respective views with such passion and confidence as to seem quite convincing. But when it comes to finding scientific truth, passion and confidence carry little weight. The currency that matters is data—specifically, data that are acquired through sound methodology and are interpreted appropriately, with nuance, for the question at hand. And when we take a critical look at the data on protein and human health, the arguments against higher protein intake come out bankrupt. Is the RDA “adequate”? A common theme echoed by protein skeptics has been the assertion that the US RDA for protein—currently set at 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, or just under 0.4 g per pound of body weight per day—is “adequate for most people’s basic needs.”1 I, on the other hand, have stated on many occasions that I recommend double this amount—around 1.6 g/kg and up to 2.2 g/kg (0.8–1.0 g/lb). Why the discrepancy? To understand this, we first need to spend a little time breaking down exactly what the RDA means and, more importantly, where it came from. Origins of the protein RDA can be traced back to around the turn of the 19th to 20th century. Because protein is the only macronutrient that contains the element nitrogen (which the body uses for synthesis of amino acids and nucleic acids), researchers at this time sought to establish the level of protein required to maintain an equilibrium between nitrogen inputs (i.e., dietary protein) and nitrogen excretion (primarily through urine). If the amount of nitrogen excreted exceeds the amount ingested, then the body is in a nitrogen deficit and must break down muscle and other tissues to meet its needs—an unsustainable solution. However, if inputs and outputs are evenly matched, then intake is sufficient to maintain tissue integrity and support basic survival requirements indefinitely. (At least, intake of nitrogen in general is sufficient, though this does not account for intake requirements for specific amino acids.) From this perspective, the current RDA could indeed be regarded as “adequate,” at least for some fraction of the population. Nitrogen balance experiments throughout the 20th century have generally reported daily protein requirements roughly equivalent to the current RDA or even slightly lower.3 Thus, the 0.8 g/kg recommendation was adopted as a modestly inflated value to account for likely variation across individuals.4 Though this approach may seem sound, many nutrition experts have pointed out a number of significant flaws in the logic and methodology that gave rise to the RDA.5,6 For instance, some percentage of nitrogen is lost through sweat, making it very difficult to fully account for all nitrogen excretion. Further, these protein requirements are based on high-quality protein with optimal amino acid ratios and high bioavailability (e.g., eggs or milk protein), whereas protein from plant-based sources tend to be absorbed more poorly and are less capable of stimulating anabolic processes in the same manner as animal proteins. As a result, the RDA will be insufficient for maintaining nitrogen balance for those relying on plant-based proteins. But the most glaring fault with the research on which the RDA is based is its reliance on a very narrow sampling of the population. The studies were typically conducted in young men (often Caucasian college students) who were generally healthy and lean (some of the landmark work was based on a “standard” male body weight of 150 lbs—what I weighed when I was about 15-years-old) and often physically inactive. Even the tiny “buffer” that was added to the RDA to account for interindividual variability was only based on variability within these narrow study cohorts (covering 1-2 standard deviations from the mean). It did not in any way account for the much greater variability across the full US population, which is largely composed of older adults who are known to require significantly higher levels of protein intake than individuals in their 20s, due to anabolic resistance. The RDA also fails to consider other common cases where protein requirements increase, such as during pregnancy, breastfeeding, childhood development, or recovery from injury or illness, let alone the added protein needs of those who engage in regular resistance training. In other words, the RDA is adequate for the body’s functional basic needs if you are a diminutive, fairly sedentary, young adult in otherwise good health who is not attempting to add muscle to your frame.

Let’s say you are indeed one of the lucky ones who can get by on just 0.8 g/kg of protein every day. Is “getting by” really a worthy goal? Do we tell our kids to be happy with a D+ when they could have gotten an A or A- with a bit of work? Of course not, and the reason is simple: adequate does not necessarily equate to optimal. I, along with many experts in nutrition, exercise science, and aging research, have long espoused the notion that building and maintaining muscle mass is vital for retaining functional capacities as we age and for living as long and as healthy a life as possible. Skeletal muscle is the organ responsible for absorbing the most glucose and is therefore vital for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Given that dysregulated glucose homeostasis sits squarely at the center of the diseases that kill most people in the developed world (think cardiovascular disease, most cancers, Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes), it’s impossible to argue that even if muscle did nothing else for you, the simple fact that it is key to regulating glucose seems reason enough to put on muscle. Of course, add to this the fact that quality of life matters at least as much, if not more, than length of life to most of us, and you come to an inescapable conclusion: if you want to live longer and live better (avoiding sarcopenia—i.e., low muscle mass—might be the single most important step here), you’d better devote a lot of time and energy to building muscle. [To dive into the Mount Everest of evidence supporting these assertions would be beyond the scope of this piece, but you can refer to past content, such as my recent AMA episode on muscle mass, earlier AMAs on the links between muscle and longevity and quality of life, and numerous newsletters on this subject.] If we accept this fact, and I can’t think of logical argument by which we can’t, then there is simply no question that optimal protein intake is much higher than the current RDA, just like having a VO2 max at the 90th percentile of the population is better than having one at the 25th percentile if you want to live longer,7,8 or having a HbA1c of 5.1% is better than having one of 5.6% (i.e., both are below the cutoff of even pre-diabetes, but the former is still associated with lower all-cause mortality).9 Protein is required not only for preventing muscle loss but also for stimulating and providing the raw materials for muscle growth, and countless randomized trials and meta-analyses have consistently converged on a protein intake of around 1.6-2.2 g/kg/day—more than double the RDA—as the optimal level to maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS).10,11 Even many critics of the protein boom concede that existing research supports the idea that the RDA is too low to support maximal muscle growth, though they question the degree to which intake needed to be increased. In an April article from the New York Times,1 the author argues that 1.5x the RDA is enough to maximize muscle gains, citing a trial showing no difference between groups given 1.5x the RDA and 2.0x the RDA.12 However, it’s worth pointing out that this trial, which involved resistance training in conjunction with the 10-week diet intervention, was conducted in untrained adults. Starting from low baseline strength, the baseline protein requirements in these individuals would have also been relatively low, so even modest increases above the RDA would have been sufficient to support the excess needed to build more muscle. If this study had, by contrast, been conducted in those who already had a moderate amount of muscle and/or people who were not newcomers (read: hyper-responders) to resistance training, protein requirements for maintenance of that baseline level of muscle would have been significantly higher, and thus, even greater increases above the RDA would be necessary to support further muscle gains. Indeed, most analyses indicate that MPS and muscle hypertrophy don’t start to plateau until at least 1.6 g/kg/day of protein intake, and the threshold is likely higher with increasing age, increasing baseline muscle mass, or lower protein quality (i.e., plant proteins, as discussed earlier). Can you have “too much” protein? We’ve now presented evidence that the RDA is too low for optimal health and, for many groups, is too low even for maintaining basic nitrogen equilibrium. It therefore stands to reason that you ought to shoot for a level of intake somewhere above that of the RDA, ideally at least 1.6 g/kg/day (~0.8 g/lb/day). But is it possible, as many critics claim, to aim too high? Can too much protein be dangerous? Dr. David B. Allison, the current Chief of Nutrition and Director of the Children’s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine, recently addressed this very question in a review paper published earlier this summer.13 As he explains, we must again begin with a close examination of the origins of the belief in the so-called “dangers” of a high-protein diet. This strangely, pathologically persistent idea stemmed mainly from century-old anecdotal reports of “poisoning” among individuals consuming very large amounts of meat. These reports were cited by other researchers, who were then cited by others, who were then cited by others until the dubious anecdotes evolved into the widely accepted—but ultimately unproven—belief that too much protein can be broadly harmful to health. (Of note, no cases of such “meat poisoning” have been reported since the advent of regulatory oversight of food safety, even with the growing popularity of “carnivore” diets in the present day.) Today, much of the fear surrounding the dangers of high protein intake concerns its potential negative impacts on the kidneys due to increased urea production. Indeed, such effects have been shown in a handful of studies in mice, but human data have failed to substantiate these findings, including at very high levels of intake (more than 3 g/kg/day).14–16 Now, last time I checked, we were the species of interest, not our furry little four-legged rodent friends. According to a Cochrane review, even among individuals with existing chronic kidney disease, moderately restricting protein does not appear to significantly reduce risk of death or disease progression.17 Other concerns regarding the possibility of “too much” protein include effects on cancer risk and aging, but these worries have even less grounding in evidence than fears over kidney function. I’ve discussed both of these subjects in depth in previous premium articles (see here for protein and cancer and here for protein and aging), but in essence, these concerns arose primarily from hypothetical mechanistic links that have not stood up remotely to actual empirical inquiry. Finally, some argue that reducing protein intake can improve metabolic health. This view partially stems from observational data linking meat intake with type 2 diabetes,18 though as I’ve explained so often in the past, it is much more likely that these associations reflect the influence of countless confounding variables than a true, causal link between meat (let alone protein per se) and metabolic dysfunction. Still, many protein nay-sayers point out that the alleged metabolic benefits of protein restriction are also supported by results from randomized trials, and given that randomized trials are regarded as the “gold standard” for determining the health effects of a given intervention, it’s worth taking a moment to examine these data more closely. One commonly cited study is a 2016 trial involving 38 overweight or mildly obese men randomized to protein restriction (~7–9% of total calories from protein) or their usual diet (~10–14% calories from protein).19 After an average of about 43 days on the respective diets, those in the protein restriction group had decreased in total body weight (−2.62±2.18 kg, or a loss of ~5.8 lbs), fat mass (−1.37±1.55 kg, or a loss of ~3.0 lbs), and fasting glucose levels (−7.00±9.33 mg/dL), whereas the control group had not changed significantly from baseline in any of these metrics. Yet although these results seem to suggest that lower protein intake improves metabolic health, they are not as convincing as they might first appear. The changes were small and highly variable (as evidenced by the high standard deviations), raising questions about their reliability and clinical significance. More importantly, the results indicate that roughly half of the weight lost by protein-restricted participants came from lean mass. While some lean loss is inevitable with total weight loss, a more typical ratio (e.g., seen with GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs or overall calorie restriction) is approximately 25-30% lean mass loss,20 whereas a loss of 50% lean mass is far more likely to have a net negative impact on overall body composition and metabolic health, given the metabolic functions of muscle described earlier. But perhaps my favorite piece of “evidence” cited for the metabolic benefits of protein restriction is a 2022 trial in 21 individuals with metabolic syndrome randomized to protein restriction or overall calorie restriction.21 Why is it my favorite? Because it reminds us of the vital role that editors and peer-review play (or rather, are supposed to play) in guarding against dissemination of faulty data. The numbers in this study quite literally don’t add up. The reported daily intakes of total calories and calories from protein are mathematically inconsistent with the level of protein intake they report in terms of grams per kilogram of body weight, so we have no idea how many calories these participants were really consuming, nor how much protein. How the reviewers didn’t catch this is anyone’s guess, but it effectively prohibits any meaningful interpretation of results. If the science is so clear, why are recommendations still so low? This past spring, I was interviewed for the New York Times Well Festival, and as the discussion eventually turned to protein, the interviewer framed my views on protein requirements as being contradictory to “scientific consensus.” After all, the RDA has remained at 0.8 g/kg/day for nearly 40 years, so there must be a reason, right? In preparing this piece, our goal has never been to promote some sort of protein iconoclast agenda. Quite the opposite—we have actively sought evidence to contradict our incoming perception that the RDA is too low, and we have attempted to share the strongest of those results throughout this article, along with our reasoning as to where and why they fall short. We have made every effort to be thorough in our evaluation of the evidence—and we certainly aren’t alone in our conclusions. Indeed, the shortcomings of the RDA have long been acknowledged by both government agencies and the scientific community. The fact is that the RDA was never intended as a broadly applicable guideline for optimal protein intake. It has always been reported as a minimum that must be significantly increased for children, older adults, active individuals, and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.22 Somehow, those adjustments have been lost as part of the popular discourse about protein. Further, the flaws in research that gave rise to the RDA are now widely recognized, including by US government agencies. Nitrogen balance studies are no longer regarded as an acceptable basis for estimating true protein requirements, and nutrition researchers are increasingly calling for the use of alternative methods to serve as the foundation for future RDA editions.23,24 According to Dr. David Klurfeld, a nutrition scientist and long-time leader of nutrition research for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the FDA now primarily relies on Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) and, increasingly, Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS)—both of which critically account for protein quality (i..e, amino acid ratios) and digestibility, in contrast to the RDA—in evaluating claims with respect to protein and in setting daily values for protein. Indeed, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) is currently re-evaluating RDAs and dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for protein and other nutrients in light of evidence supporting an increase to existing recommendations. Put simply, the “scientific consensus” supporting the current RDA is anything but. Are you getting enough? Of course, all of the above leads to the one question that matters to each of you as readers: are you getting enough protein? Some popular press outlets would argue that the answer is probably “yes,” noting that “the idea that Americans don’t eat enough protein … is a lie.”25 Yet this perspective is based on data showing that the majority of Americans meet the RDA, which as we’ve seen, is insufficient for many individuals’ basic functional needs, even according to the guidelines themselves.26 These very same data reveal that the majority of Americans are not achieving a level of intake that would best facilitate muscle mass gains and optimize health. So I encourage you to evaluate your own dietary habits—including the type of protein and timing of intake—to ensure that you’re supplying your body with the building blocks it needs to become stronger and healthier. Protein—and nutrition in general—is just one part of that larger goal. And toward that end, we must not get so wrapped up in online debates that we confuse passionate tribalism for scientific fact or lose sight of what truly constitutes rigorous evidence—because ultimately, it’s evidence and reason that will lead us to the answers that make a difference for our own health and longevity. And in the case of protein, the science speaks for itself. We would like to acknowledge Dr. David B. Allison and Dr. David Klurfeld for the invaluable information, insights, and feedback they provided as we drafted this article.

      "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter explains how to evaluate sugar and its substitutes in the context of health. Peter explores the role of sweeteners in three common use-cases – beverages, protein supplements, and sweet treats – and breaks down how our evolutionary craving for sweetness now clashes with today’s food environment. He examines whether sugar is uniquely fattening, the hormonal effects of sugar consumption, and the significance of timing in sugar intake. The episode compares natural versus refined sugars, sugar in beverages versus in solid foods, and the pros and cons of popular sweeteners including saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, allulose, and sugar alcohols like erythritol and xylitol. With a focus on weight management, glycemic impact, gut health, and long-term safety, this episode offers a comprehensive guide to navigating the sweetener landscape with clarity and nuance.

Show Notes A quick tangent on chess and parenting [A: 2:30, V: 1:00] Chess anecdote – losing to his 7-year-old Peter thought he was playing the best chess game of his life but made a blunder and lost in two moves to his 7-year-old son. His son now wins about six out of ten games, which is both enjoyable to watch and frustrating to experience. Nick jokes that based on Peter’s personality and his book, people might expect he wouldn’t handle losing to a child well. Peter’s competitiveness and sportsmanship lesson Peter insists he is not externally competitive, only internally. Chess is the only activity where losing to another person makes him truly upset. He tries to model sportsmanship for his sons by shaking hands and saying “good game” after losing, however, in a recent incident he lost to his son and, out of frustration, smacked his chess king piece across the room instead of calmly resigning. His wife witnessed it and sarcastically praised him for being a great role model for sportsmanship at age 52. It may not help that is son is a bit of a trash talker His son’s nickname is “Little Bag Smoker,” because he often taunts, “I’m going to smoke your bags.” Overview of key scenarios for evaluating sugar and sweeteners [A: 6:15, V: 5:15] Introduction to the topic Today’s topic is sugar and sugar substitutes—chosen because it’s a common listener question and a daily decision point for many people. Plan to cover: Why we’re wired to crave sugar. Sugar’s effects on appetite, weight, and metabolic health. Natural vs. refined sugar. Timing of sugar intake vs. total quantity consumed. Sugar substitutes: aspartame, sucralose, stevia, monk fruit, allulose. Effects on weight, insulin, microbiome. Sugar alcohols like xylitol and erythritol. Long-term safety concerns (cancer, cardiovascular disease). How to apply the science to personal and patient choices. Peter’s two preliminary comments 1) Updated literature – This topic was covered in 2020 on AMA #18, but new research (especially on non-nutritive sweeteners) justifies revisiting it. Science progresses, and there have been meaningful updates. 2) Framework focus – Despite diving into technical details, the goal is to land on practical recommendations for real-world scenarios. Goal for the episode – key practical questions Is eating a lot of sugar “okay”? If not, is switching to sugar substitutes (while keeping the same quantity of food/beverage) a better option? Example: Six regular Mountain Dews/day vs. six diet Mountain Dews/day. Trade-offs between real sugar and artificial sweeteners in different contexts. The three main “use cases” for artificial sweeteners 1) Beverages – Regular vs. diet soda or other drinks. 2) Protein products – Protein powders and bars often require sweetening. Protein is difficult to work with, tastes unpleasant without sweeteners, and is best obtained from whole food when possible. Processed protein sources fall into: Dry/salty forms (e.g., jerky, sticks). Sweetened forms (e.g., shakes, bars). If sweetened, the choice is between artificial sweeteners and real sugar. Peter likes the David Bar 3) Sweet treats – Desserts, candy, and other indulgences. The question: Is it better to satisfy cravings with products sweetened by sucrose/HFCS or artificial sweeteners? Setting expectations for the listener To answer these questions, listeners will need to understand some biochemistry. Peter apologizes in advance but stresses it’s necessary to “land the plane” with meaningful, actionable conclusions.

      "title": "Weighted vests for weight-loss maintenance?",
      "content": "As difficult as it may be to lose unwanted body fat, many find that keeping it off long-term is even more challenging. Our bodies interpret a decline in fat stores as a threat to survival and have evolved several mechanisms to prevent further weight loss. Multiple neural and endocrine signals kick in with a vengeance to increase appetite, decrease our desire for physical activity, and increase metabolic efficiency. These negative feedback signals become stronger in proportion with the degree of weight loss and can make it very difficult to continue losing weight or even maintain the fat loss that you’ve already achieved. But might there be a way to trick the body into turning off these compensatory mechanisms? A fairly recent theory suggests that the addition of external weight—for instance, in the form of a weighted vest—might help to dampen the body’s perception of weight loss, thus mitigating the powerful signals driving weight regain. This possibility was recently put to the test in a study using weighted vests in obese individuals undergoing weight loss.1 Does this added, artificial “body weight” impact weight loss maintenance? The “gravitostat” hypothesis The motivation behind the current study lies in a relatively new theory known as the “gravitostat” hypothesis.2 This theory posits that weight loss is sensed by bone cells in the lower extremities as a reduction in gravitational loading—in essence, less body weight means less force transmitted to the ground. These cells then signal to the brain, which responds by increasing appetite and decreasing energy expenditure to prevent further decreases in body weight. If true, this hypothesis would suggest that we might be able to trick the body into thinking it hasn’t lost significant amounts of its energy reserves simply by adding external weight in order to make up for the gravitational difference caused by the loss of fat. Without the loss of gravitational load, we might at least partially block the regulatory mechanisms designed to promote weight regain. Or so goes the theory.

Participants were randomized to either a weight loss only group (WL, n=17) or weight loss plus daily use of a weighted vest (WL+WV, n=20) for a period of six months. During this time, all participants also followed a very low-calorie diet of ~1100-1300 kcal/day to induce weight loss. WL+WV subjects were instructed to wear the vest up to 10 hours per day (minimum: 5 hours/day) and record daily use in a journal. The weight of the vest was increased each week to compensate for weight loss, up to a maximum of 15% of the individual’s starting body weight. Body mass, estimated resting metabolic rate (RMR), and body composition were assessed at baseline and at the end of the 6-month intervention, as well as 18 months after cessation of both calorie restriction and the use of the weighted vest (i.e., 24 months from the study start). What they found The WL and WL+WV groups lost statistically equivalent amounts of weight by the end of the 6-month weight-loss phase, with an average change of -10.3 kg (-22.7 lbs; 95% CI: -13.7, -6.8 kg) and -11.2 kg (-24.7 lbs; 95% CI: -14.6, -7.7 kg) in body weight for the two groups, respectively. Both groups also lost similar amounts of lean mass, with average changes of -2.8 kg (-6.2 lbs; 95% CI: -3.8, -1.8 kg) and -3.0 kg (-6.6 lbs; 95% CI: -4.0, -1.9 kg), respectively. Thus, the use of a weighted vest during active weight loss did not appear to have a substantial impact on body composition changes experienced during calorie restriction. However, by 24 months (18 months after the end of calorie restriction and vest use), a significant divergence was observed between groups. While the WL group had regained all lost bodyweight (+0.9 kg/2 lbs from baseline; 95% CI: -3.9, 5.8 kg), the WL+WV group had only regained slightly more than half of the lost weight (-4.8 kg/-10.6 lbs from baseline; 95% CI: -9.6, 0.1 kg). Perhaps most strikingly, despite the equivalent weight loss during the diet phase, RMR after 6 months of diet declined by just -16 cal/day in the WL+WV group (95% CI: -100.8, 68.2), compared to a drop of -238 cal/day in the WL group (95% CI: -321.9, -153.0). RMR is highly dependent on total body mass, with muscle tissue consuming far more energy than adipose tissue even at rest, so any amount of weight loss—whether primarily due to fat loss or lean mass loss—is generally accompanied by a corresponding decrease in RMR. The fact that RMR did not decrease in the WL+WV group, despite a 25-lb drop in total body weight, is therefore quite remarkable. This indicates that the addition of the weighted vest did indeed offset the reduction in resting energy expenditure typically seen with loss of fat mass. By 18 months post-diet, RMR had returned to near-baseline in both groups, -9.4 cal/day and -3.5 cal/day for WL and WL+WV, respectively. This was to be expected for the WL group, as they had regained their baseline weight by this timepoint, but is more surprising in the WL+WV group, which remained reduced in weight. (It bears note, however, that all 24-month follow-up data are from subjects who voluntarily returned for testing, which was only around half of the original subjects in each group.) Not a smoking gun for a “gravitostat” The much smaller decline in RMR at 6 months in the WL+WV group—and the fact that this group experienced less weight regain after cessation of calorie restriction—would seem to suggest that the addition of external weight prevented or mitigated the strong compensatory responses that typically accompany weight loss. In other words, DeLong et al.’s results appear to support the gravitostat hypothesis, but a closer look leaves significant room for doubt. The fact that the use of a weighted vest almost entirely suppressed diet-induced reductions in RMR is significant, but we must keep in mind that both groups lost similar amounts of total body weight and lean mass. This means that although the WL+WV group may not have shown increased metabolic efficiency in RMR, they must have experienced some other shift in the balance of “calories in” vs. “calories out” that would prevent them from losing more weight than the WL group. One possibility is that they simply ate more. While the authors prescribed a uniform level of calorie intake for both groups, they don’t indicate that they monitored dietary compliance throughout the study, so the WL+WV group may very well have deviated from the protocol and eaten more than the WL group, which might suggest that they experienced more of a compensatory increase in appetite. But it’s also possible that the WL+WV group did indeed experience a drop in energy expenditure—it just wasn’t apparent in RMR. RMR is an estimate of how much energy the body consumes at rest to support basic metabolic functions, but it does not include the energy expended for exercise or basic physical activities of daily life. Techniques that can estimate total daily energy expenditure were not employed in this study, so we cannot know whether participants in the WL+WV group may have demonstrated greater metabolic efficiency during activity, thus reducing their total energy demand. Likewise, the requirement for wearing a weighted vest may have led this group to drastically reduce their physical activity due to the added strain caused by the weight, and this, too, could easily contribute to an overall reduction in energy needs without necessarily necessitating a reduction in RMR. In all, the limited metrics in this study mean that we can only speculate on the causes of such large differences in RMR without associated differences in weight changes. But what can we make of the fact that the WL+WV group only regained about half the weight that was lost after the diet phase ended, compared to full weight regain in the WL group? It’s worth reiterating that the 24-month sampling only included about half of the original study participants, so it is possible that the observed difference in weight regain, or lack of a difference in RMR at 24 months, would look quite different with a full study sample. Yet even beyond this concern, these results still don’t quite add up. If participants stopped wearing weighted vests after six months but remained weight-reduced, what would stop the body from sensing deloading during the post-intervention stage? The authors propose no mechanistic explanation as to how the effects of the weighted vests might persist for over a year after cessation of use. A more plausible explanation could be that participants’ choices with respect to calorie intake and activity level during and after the intervention may have been biased by the knowledge of the group they were in. After all, this study could not be conducted in a blinded manner, and neither diet nor physical activity was monitored. It’s entirely possible that those who knew they were in a group that “should” keep weight off were biased toward choices that made that very outcome more likely. All together, these results remain inconclusive due to potential confounding variables, and they aren’t fully consistent with what we would expect with the gravitostat hypothesis. So although they may provide some interesting fodder for future study, they are hardly a smoking gun to validate this new-kid-on-the-block theory about body weight regulation. The bottom line The shortcomings of this study prevent us from concluding that weighted vest use can help with maintenance of fat loss or avoidance of weight loss-attributed declines in RMR, though they should not be taken as a reason to discount the many other potential benefits of weighted vests. Much like ruck sacks, these products can serve as conditioning tools for both aerobic and anaerobic training, for strengthening upper back musculature and improving postural control, and as weight loss aids by increasing energy expenditure. But when it comes to providing validation for any potential “gravitostat” mechanism for body weight regulation, this study adds very little to the limited body of evidence that preceded it. At present, the alternative “lipostat” model—which maintains that the body defends a certain level of fat mass, rather than gravitational force—is more established and has far more support. (For those interested, this model was discussed in greater depth in my previous podcast interviews with Drs. Rudy Leibel and Stephan Guyenet.) Yet we know that the human body often has multiple, overlapping pathways for accomplishing vital goals such as the avoidance of starvation, and future research may indeed uncover a role for a “gravitostat” in conjunction with other weight regulation mechanisms. Until then, whether you’re trying to lose weight or merely add a little extra to your training routine, weighted vests remain a valuable tool for improving body composition and achieving fitness goals—whether through a gravitostat mechanism or otherwise.

      "content": "Charles Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and best-selling author known for distilling complex neuroscience and psychology into practical strategies for behavior change, performance, and decision-making. In this episode, Charles explores the neuroscience behind habit formation, including how cue-routine-reward loops drive nearly half of our daily actions and why positive reinforcement is far more effective than punishment. He explains how institutions like the military and Alcoholics Anonymous engineer environments to change behavior at scale, as well as discussing the limits of willpower and how to preserve it by shaping context. The conversation also covers the real timeline of habit formation, how to teach better habits to kids, the role of failure and self-compassion in lasting change, and the power of social accountability. Charles further discusses how cognitive routines enhance productivity and creativity, how to gamify long-term goals through immediate rewards, why identity and purpose are often the strongest forces behind sustainable behavior change, and the potential of AI to power habit change.

Show Notes How Charles’s background in journalism and personal experiences led to his interest in habit formation [A: 3:15, V: 1:20] In many ways, Charles is kind of the “OG guy” when it comes to talking about habit formation It’s hard to believe that it’s been 13 years since his amazing book on the subject matter [The Power of Habit] Peter probably read it 8 years ago, but it’s a topic that is relevant regardless of what you do For Peter’s job and how he tries to help people, it really comes down to knowing what to do and then putting it into practice Give folks a bit of a sense of your background and maybe even how that factored into you taking an interest in the topic of habits Before Charles wrote The Power of Habit, he had been a business and science reporter for quite a while He decided to become a journalist after he went to Harvard Business School, and he got his MBA About halfway through business school he realized it’s a lot more fun to write about business than to do it; so he decided to become a journalist One of the things that he noticed as he was writing, are 2 experiences that got him interested in habits He was working at the New York Times at that point Because he had spent time overseas in Iraq during the war, he had reported on a bunch of different things 1 – When he was in Iraq, he was embedded with a unit that was right outside of Baghdad, he was talking to a major, and he asked him, “How do you train soldiers to become soldiers?” Because one of the things that you see in a war zone in particular is that the behaviors are so deeply ingrained The goal is to ingrain a set of behaviors that so that if a bomb goes off, everyone around you knows exactly what to do in that moment, and they react automatically The major described the military as “A giant habit change machine” They teach young recruits who maybe don’t have any self-discipline, who maybe are prone to emotional upheavals 2 – When he came back to the US, he was thinking about this to himself, “If I’m so smart and so talented…” Why can’t I get myself to lose weight? Why can’t I get myself to go running in the morning every day? Why is this such a struggle for me when I’m so good at other things? He realized it was because he had not learned and studied how habits function in his own habits “Once I learned that, I had the tools to change how I behave automatically, which is of course the most important component of our behavior because it’s what we do every day.”‒ Charles Duhigg What year did you get back to the US from Iraq? Charles was in Iraq from 2003-2004; he got back at the end of ‘04, beginning of ‘05 He was at the LA Times and he started working at The New York Times in ‘06 What did you start writing about? When did you pick that thread up again? He was writing for the business section at The NY Times, and he wrote a piece about the science of hand washing, which was really fascinating There’s been really interesting research, particularly out of the United Kingdom, about: How do we incentivize people in developing nations to wash their hands? A lot of this was sponsored by Unilever, the soap company They found that people in poor communities (particularly in India and Pakistan and in other parts of Asia) would buy soap, and then they would save the soap for special occasions It was like something you gave to a guest when they came over It was something that you used before you went to mosque or for prayer As a result, they weren’t washing their hands every day Of course, we know that using soap actually correlates with preventing a lot of diseases A number of researchers in the UK took this on to try and figure out: How do we create hand washing habit using soap? What they discovered was, you need to focus on the reward Unilever, in all the advertisements, would talk about the benefits you got from using soap: that if you used soap disease would go down That was not influential 1 – It was too abstract 2 – You’re trying to educate people who don’t think that they’re at an education deficit ⇒ We see the same thing in the United States around vaccine resistance and other things, telling people, “Oh, you don’t know enough. I’m going to tell you the truth.” ‒ that almost never works What you have to do is you have to create incentives where you get an immediate reward for that behavior What they did is they actually changed the scent of the soaps They made the scent of the soaps less powerful because it seemed less like a perfume, less like a fancy thing Then they ran these ads where they equated washing your hands with taking care of your children, not necessarily your own health, not your own cleanliness When I wash my hands with soap, I can feed my children They were creating that sense, that identity reward that says, “By doing this, you’re a good parent.” And that changed everything Peter is always intrigued by this type of problem How long did it take them to figure out that that was the unlock? Was this iterative? What type of research did they have to do? It took them years It took a really sustained exposure What’s interesting is part of this research and where it came out of was trying to understand the neural roots of disgust ⇒ Disgust is a really, really powerful instinct that all humans have, and they really wanted to understand how do we capitalize on disgust as a negative reward? They spent years on this, but like everything that ends up having widespread change, it really paid off enormous dividends Peter asks, “When you say they, who are the types of people? Are these behavioral economists? Are they psychologists, sociologists?” There’s a woman named Val Curtis who in particular led a lot of this research Charles believes her background is in sociology This was during the heyday of behavioral economics when Danny Kahneman and others, Amos Tversky’s work was really getting noticed for the first time and was making its way into other fields They brought in a lot of the behavioral economists and psychologists This points to something interesting: some of the most exciting research that’s happening right now is this interdisciplinary research There tend to become these silos within universities When you look at what’s really interesting that’s happening, it tends to be the people who are stepping outside of those silos The science behind reinforcement: why positive rewards outperform punishment in habit formation [A: 10:15, V: 9:06] A framework for understanding motivation to change habits The way Charles described it a moment ago, it was more avoidance of negative that got the job done Peter thinks of this as a 2×2: positive and negative, giving (carrot) and taking away (stick) An example of taking away: disgust is bad, and we’re going to remove disgust What does the science tell us about that foursquare? A bit of context About 40-45% of what we do every day is habits This comes from research by Wendy Wood at USC ⇒ Every habit in our life has 3 components: {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Does eating a diverse array of flavonoids prevent chronic disease?",
      "content": "Are berries and red wine the secret to living longer? If you’ve been keeping an eye on nutrition headlines this summer, you might have heard that a fountain of youth could be hiding in your produce aisle or liquor store. Yes, it seems that every so often, a study comes out linking [insert food item] to [insert health outcome], and the press predictably latches on to the findings to generate clickbait headlines that we’d all love to believe. The impetus for this recent iteration of the pattern? A research article on associations between consumption of flavonoids — i.e., biologically active compounds found in plants — and various health outcomes. While it can be very tempting to jump on board with any results suggesting that we can improve our health with delicious foods we already enjoy eating, wanting something to be true unfortunately doesn’t make it so. We must be very careful to examine the data with a critical eye and decide for ourselves what conclusions we can really make — rather than falling for punchy, too-good-to-be-true headlines. Are flavonoids a fountain of youth? Flavonoids are naturally occurring compounds found in plants — think the anthocyanins that make berries blue, the catechins in your green tea, or the quercetin in red wine. There are six main types of flavonoids covering a range of potential benefits, including antioxidant effects, anti-inflammatory properties, hormone modulation, and more. Given these varied effects, researchers Parmenter et al. asked an intuitive question: if different flavonoids can have different benefits for the body, do individuals who consume a diverse array of these compounds tend to experience broader protection and better health than those who consume fewer flavonoid types? To test this, they turned to UK Biobank data from over 120,000 individuals (ages 40–69 years) with no cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), cancer, respiratory disease, or neurodegenerative disease at baseline. Participants completed 24-hour dietary questionnaires on 2–5 occasions, from which the investigators calculated flavonoid diversity scores (covering a total of 31 unique flavonoid compounds) by grouping plant-derived foods and beverages according to flavonoid content. The researchers then followed participants for about a decade (median follow-up of 8.7–10.6 years, depending on the specific outcome) to assess incidence of chronic diseases and all-cause mortality (ACM). After controlling for confounding factors like exercise, smoking, BMI, education, and socioeconomic status, they reported that higher flavonoid diversity correlated with a striking pattern of risk reduction across several health outcomes. When normalizing for total flavonoid intake, participants in the highest quintile of diversity were found to have a 14% lower risk of ACM than participants in the lowest quintile (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78–0.95), and this lower mortality risk was reflected in risk analyses for specific chronic diseases. Those consuming the most diverse breadth of flavonoids also exhibited a 10% risk reduction for CVD (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.98), a 20% risk reduction for T2D (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.91), and an 8% risk reduction in both total cancer (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.99) and respiratory disease (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.98).

Who are the people eating the most diverse array of flavonoid-rich foods? With various flavonoids present in various plants, it is the people who take health advice like “eating the rainbow” — a simple reminder to fill your plate with a variety of fruits and vegetables. By definition, these people are eating more micronutrient-rich, whole foods, which means they’re also probably consuming less calorie-dense ultraprocessed foods. And if they’re taking care to heed advice regarding fruits and vegetables, there’s a high probability that they’re adhering to other healthy habits, too, such as engaging in regular exercise or getting enough sleep. This isn’t a leap, you can see it right in the study data. Those in the lowest flavonoid diversity group were more likely to smoke, less likely to exercise, and had higher BMIs — all characteristics of a generally unhealthy population. As such, those with the highest diversity scores weren’t just eating more colorful foods — they were living fundamentally different lives characterized by many healthy choices that could all contribute to lower risk of disease and mortality. Unfortunately for Parmenter et al., this makes determining the individual impacts of various interventions (like flavonoid diversity) incredibly tricky. Sure, the researchers controlled for known confounders like exercise and smoking status, but there are countless other, unmeasured factors that cluster together in healthy lifestyles: stress management, sleep quality, preventive healthcare, social connections, and dozens of other behaviors that no statistical model can fully capture. It’s possible that flavonoids have nothing at all to do with the apparent health of the group in the highest flavonoid diversity quintile, and that the associations are due entirely to these other healthy-behavior covariates. Indeed, if flavonoid diversity was truly a major driver of these health benefits, we’d expect to see a clear dose-response relationship — i.e., incrementally more diversity should lead to incrementally better outcomes. But that’s not what happened. Instead of a smooth progression, the results looked more like statistical noise. Benefits appeared and disappeared across different levels of intake without any coherent biological story. In some cases, increased flavonoid diversity even appeared to very slightly increase risk. This erratic pattern is likely a combination of residual confounding that the statistical models couldn’t capture and the inherent inaccuracy of self-reported dietary data. When people fill out food questionnaires, they’re relying on memory, making estimations, and often telling researchers what they think they should be eating rather than what they actually consume. Layer this reporting bias on top of unmeasured lifestyle differences and the potential for dietary changes over time, and you get exactly the kind of messy, inconsistent results we see here — the signature of confounding and measurement error masquerading as a biological effect. Creating hypotheses for further research Still, none of the flaws in this study or its interpretations should be taken as evidence denying the possible health effects of flavonoids. There are plausible biological mechanisms by which these and other plant-derived compounds might benefit health, some of which are supported by experimental evidence. We’ve discussed a handful of such effects in past content on the flavonoids curcumin and epicatechin, for instance. I absolutely hope to see more thorough investigation of such compounds in the near future. But what can we take from this particular study on flavonoid diversity? It demonstrates that people who eat diverse, plant-rich diets tend to be healthier overall — a fairly intuitive finding. Flavonoids might be contributing to that health benefit, or they might simply be passive bystanders — markers of a more general lifestyle pattern that promotes well-being through multiple pathways. In other words, these data are best used for generating hypotheses for future rigorous experimentation, such as randomized controlled trials involving flavonoid supplements or carefully controlled diets. As with all observational research, the present study should not be interpreted as evidence of causation. The bottom line Despite what many of us might wish (and what headlines and social media might claim), the secret to longevity isn’t hiding in your wine glass or cup of tea. It’s in the comprehensive health-conscious choices that you make throughout your life — which might include a diet rich in flavonoids. So by all means, eat your colorful fruits and vegetables. Enjoy that cup of tea or maybe even an occasional glass of red wine. But don’t expect them to be silver bullets for health while you neglect exercise, sleep, stress management, and all the other unsexy factors that actually drive long-term well-being. The real secret isn’t in any single nutrient or food — in fact, it’s no secret at all. It’s making tried-and-true choices for our health across the board, day after day, and seeing the accumulated effort gradually translate to a healthier life.

      "content": "Eric Verdin is a physician-scientist and the CEO of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging whose career has centered on understanding how epigenetics, metabolism, and the immune system influence the aging process. In this episode, Eric traces his scientific journey from studying viruses and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to leading aging research at the Buck Institute, offering insights into how aging impairs immune and nervous system function—including thymic shrinkage, chronic inflammation, and reduced vaccine response—and how these changes impact lifespan. He explores the metabolic underpinnings of aging, such as oxidative stress and insulin and IGF-1 signaling, and he discusses practical tools like zone 2 cardio, ketogenic diets, and GLP-1 drugs. The conversation also covers declining NAD levels with age, the roles of NAD-consuming enzymes such as sirtuins and CD38, and what current NAD-boosting strategies (like NMN, NR, and IV NAD) can and can’t accomplish. Eric weighs in on promising longevity interventions including rapamycin, growth hormone for thymic regeneration, and anti-inflammatory therapies, while also examining the promise and limitations of current biological age tests and the potential of combining epigenetic, proteomic, and organ-specific metrics with wearables to guide personalized longevity care.

Show Notes Eric’s scientific journey from virology to the field of geroscience [2:45] Give folks a little bit of a sense of what attracted you to the field of geroscience and how your journey and background brought you to where you are today It’s a bit of a serendipitous type of story Eric is an MD by training from Belgium He did his last year of medical school at Harvard, and this just opened his eyes to a whole world He was the first person in his family to go to college Eric explains, “Ending up at Harvard with some of the best teachers, some of the best students, was just mind-blowing. I went to medical school wanting to do research, never had that sort of a ‘doctor fiber,’ I call it, so I really wanted to research.” He finished medical school and came back for a postdoc at the Charleston Clinic, working on diabetes and metabolism This is where the story gets circuitous He ended up becoming interested in the reason for the etiology of type 1 diabetes and worked on viruses and autoimmunity This led him to mostly a career in virology, which confuses people He spent many years working on a variety of viruses including HIV, and herpes viruses, and so on Through that work, he ended up cloning some of the first epigenetic regulators, a family of proteins called HDACs This family of epigenetic regulators ended up being important in aging, and starting in 1995, 1996, his lab shifted toward the study of aging Today, he has only one postdoc in the lab who is working on HIV The whole lab is focused on epigenetics, immunology, and metabolism, so the interface between these variables Eric reflects, “In some way, it’s the beauty of an academic career, which I’ve just followed my interest, sometimes followed the money a little bit in terms of funding.” Now, Eric has another additional responsibility, which is to lead the Buck Institute for Research on Aging He splits his time between the lab and some more leadership type of activities How dysfunction in the immune system and central nervous system can drive aging throughout the body [5:00] You mentioned two things there, metabolism and immunology ‒ talk a little bit more about how each of those individually contributes to aging Immunology is central to aging in many respects “There is data showing that there are two organs that are rate-limiting in terms of your aging. It’s the central nervous system and the immune system.”‒ Eric Verdin One could have predicted this based on the fact that both organs are distributed organs If you think of your immune system, it’s located in pretty much throughout the whole organism, and so its activity can influence the wellbeing or the functioning of every single organ The same goes for a central nervous system A recent study came out from the lab of Tony Wyss-Coray showing that those biomarkers that measure aging in those organs appears to be the most predictive of your lifespan There’s also incredible data showing that if you induce a specific lesion in the immune system, for example in mice model, if you knockout ERCC1 (DNA damage repair) only in the bone marrow so that the whole immune system is affected, you actually induce accelerated aging in the whole organism and senescence in every single organ It’s been done with the ERCC1 mutation It’s also been done by knocking down the major TFAM (the major transcription factor for mitochondria) If you induce mitochondrial dysfunction only in the immune system, you induce secondary senescence in the whole organism Peter asks, “Do you think that would be true in humans?” It’s a million-dollar question It’s been shown in 2 different models in mice Eric doesn’t remember the exact strain of the mouse, but there’s no reason why it should be different It points to the importance of the immune system The second wave for the immune system is through chronic inflammation, which is tied cause and effect in the whole aging process “I find it fascinating, the whole idea of chronic inflammation which is induced by the aging process, which itself actually further accelerates aging.”‒ Eric Verdin There’s really a lot of work that’s being conducted in this area The other one that you were asking is metabolism. Peter finds it very interesting: 2 organ systems that are going to be rate-limiting in age are the central nervous system and the immune system (both of which are distributed throughout the body) Where would you put the endothelium in that list? Peter notes that the endothelium is also quite distributed across the organism Do you think that there’s an inevitability to basically endothelial damage as a process of aging, which, of course, results in the leading cause of death, the atherosclerotic diseases? It’s not sort of defined as an organ by itself It’s a cell type Eric agrees about its incredible importance, especially as it affects the heart and the cardiovascular system and the brain But he thinks of it more as a principle that maintains barrier function Not only in the endothelium but also in the skin, in the blood brain barrier These are emerging as key areas to focus on if you want to maximize your longevity The role of metabolism and oxidative stress in aging, and why antioxidant strategies have failed to deliver clear benefits [8:45] Metabolism is essential to life expectancy for a number of reasons {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Are data on dieting and depression deceiving us?",
      "content": "Dietary tracking is a common tool for aiding weight loss and improving health outcomes, and many structured diets are promoted for long-term wellness. However, the restriction involved in such diets may also lead to mental rigidness or run the risk of nutrient deficiency that could impact mood and psychological state. Thus, a new study of more than 28,000 Americans sought to investigate: does dietary restriction come with added risks for depression? Indeed, the researchers reported higher depression scores among individuals who engaged in dieting relative to those who did not.1 The findings made waves in the popular press — but do they hold up to scrutiny? Before you reconsider your nutrition goals, it’s worth digging a bit deeper into the data: what does this study really show, how strong is the link, and what can we learn? Efficacy vs. effectiveness The notion that diet may impact mental health certainly isn’t new. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated such a relationship and have generally shown that caloric restriction — especially when paired with behavioral therapy, physical activity, or long-term adherence — tends to reduce symptoms of depression.2 Yet as the authors of this recent study point out, such RCTs are only capable of assessing efficacy — how well an intervention works under ideal, controlled conditions, such as when participants are monitored for diet adherence and receive regular professional support. They are not, however, designed to assess effectiveness — how well an intervention works under real-world conditions without such strict control. When people try to diet on their own, without coaching, in the context of daily stressors, inconsistent routines, and variable support systems, the results can look very different from those reported in clinical trials. In other words, an intervention that is efficacious might not necessarily be effective, but the latter is what matters when it comes to practical health implications.

To dig more deeply into the effectiveness question, researchers Menniti et al. turned to observational data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES, a large-scale dataset from a representative sample of the U.S. population. Participants were divided into four groups based on their dietary data: 1) those who reported no nutritional restrictions whatsoever (n=25,009); 2) those who reported actively counting calories (i.e., calorie restriction, or CR; n=2,026); 3) those focused on limiting specific foods or macronutrients (i.e., dietary restriction, or DR; n=859); and 4) those who followed what the researchers called “established dietary patterns” — think Mediterranean diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), or other structured approaches (n=631). For each of these groups, the authors also assessed depression scores using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), a well-validated questionnaire that asks about symptoms like feeling down, having trouble sleeping, changes in appetite, and difficulty concentrating. The PHQ-9 is scored on a scale of 0-27, with a higher score indicating more severe depressive symptoms. Importantly, because depression and tendency to engage in dieting are both influenced by numerous other factors such as relationship status or chronic health conditions, the authors adjusted their statistical models for various potential confounding variables, including age, sex, race, education level, marital status, income, smoking, drinking habits, BMI, food security, diabetes, and hypertension. Results revealed that participants utilizing a CR approach were more depressed than participants who did not engage in any form of dieting, with an average increase in PHQ-9 score of 0.29 points relative to the non-diet group (95% CI: 0.06–0.52) after adjusting for covariates. The DR group and “established diet” group also exhibited a trend toward higher depressive scores, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance, perhaps due to the relatively low numbers of participants in these groups. These data suggest that, in a real-world setting, restricting calories may negatively impact mental health, in contrast to what has previously been observed in controlled trial settings. News outlets were quick to spread the bad news with headlines like “Your diet is making you depressed, according to science”3 and “Cutting calories can make you depressed.”4 Reality check So, should we start questioning everything we know about nutrition and mental health? Not so fast. Despite Menniti et al.’s argument that RCTs could not evaluate real-world effects of dieting on depression, the fact is that this recent study was even less capable of evaluating those effects than earlier research. As a strictly observational study, this work was incapable of testing any “effects” at all — real-world or otherwise — as such analyses can only identify correlations between variables, not their cause-and-effect relationships. To make matters worse, this analysis was based on cross-sectional data, representing a single snapshot in time, so we don’t even have any insight as to how diets and depression scores might have changed over time — or indeed, whether differences in depression scores preceded the adoption of CR. Consider this alternative explanation: what if people who are already struggling with depression are more likely to turn to dietary restriction? This isn’t far-fetched. Depression often involves feelings of low self-worth, loss of control, and a desperate search for something — anything — that might help. Restricting calories or following rigid dietary rules can provide a sense of control and accomplishment, at least temporarily. In other words, depression might be driving the dieting behavior, not the other way around. Even if we assume that dieting preceded higher depression scores, we need to take a critical look at the magnitude of this association. The 0.29-point increase in PHQ-9 scores sounds concerning until you understand how this scale actually works. The PHQ-9 runs from 0 to 27, and over such a range, a 0.29-point increase is so subtle as to be clinically insignificant despite its apparent statistical significance. This test was developed for the purpose of assessing where one falls across large bucket ranges (e.g., 0–4: no depression; 5–9: mild depression; etc.) — not for the minute differences observed in this study. (For comparison, when used to assess response to antidepressive treatments, a change of 50% in PHQ-9 score is regarded as a cutoff for “significant” improvement.5) Attempted diet vs. successful diet? Just for argument’s sake, let’s pretend that this study could indeed evaluate causal relationships between variables and that the “effect” was clinically meaningful. We still wouldn’t be able to make conclusions about whether calorie restriction truly leads to worsening depressive symptoms thanks to another shortcoming that is common throughout nutritional research: reliance on self-report data. We have no objective evidence that participants actually adhered to their reported dietary strategies. Anyone who’s ever tried to stick to a diet knows there’s often a substantial difference between what we plan to do and what we actually do. Did the people who reported “calorie restriction” actually consume fewer calories? Did they lose weight? Did they sustain their efforts for weeks, months, or just a few days? We simply don’t know. Thus, this study wasn’t designed to test the association between CR and mental health, but rather, the question actually being answered was this: “do people who believe they are restricting calories tend to have worse mental health?” The psychological impact of attempting restriction might be quite different from the impact of successfully implementing it. Someone who repeatedly tries and fails to stick to a calorie-restricted diet might experience frustration, guilt, and feelings of failure — all of which could worsen depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, someone who successfully maintains a sustainable caloric deficit and sees positive changes in their body composition might experience the opposite – net benefit for mental health. Without objective data on weight changes or calorie intake, we can only speculate about this alternate interpretation of the results, but it certainly demonstrates how self-reported data might be misleading in this context. The bottom line With many limitations and such a small effect size, basing any conclusion on these data — as the popular press has done — just adds to the noise already surrounding discussions on nutrition. This study doesn’t provide any reliable evidence that dieting causes depression, let alone enough to motivate a serious reconsideration of earlier research. This single observational study shouldn’t override the substantial body of evidence from controlled trials showing that calorie restriction typically improves mental health outcomes — not to mention the many benefits for metabolic health and prevention of chronic diseases. Of course, these benefits only materialize when dieting is “successful” — meaning that it facilitates achievement and maintenance of a healthy body weight and body composition. It’s certainly plausible that repeated, unsuccessful attempts at dieting may erode self-esteem and mental health, so perhaps the real takeaway is that how you diet may matter at least as much as whether you diet. Whether adopting an “established diet,” calorie restriction, time restriction, or dietary restriction, focus on approaches that are sustainable yet still help you to achieve your health goals — this is the surest way to maximize both mental and physical well-being through nutrition.

Overview of Episodes to be Discussed Paul Turek ‒ male fertility Paula Amato ‒ female fertility Rachel Rubin ‒ women’s sexual healthy, menopause, HRT Brian Kennedy ‒ biology of aging Tanuj Nakra and Suzan Obagi ‒ all things skincare, facial aging, rejuvenation strategies It is now 2.5 months since this episode and Peter is looking forward to discussing exactly what he has done Of all of the episodes, this would be the one where he’s had the greatest change in his personal behavior BJ Miller and Bridget Sumser ‒ all around death and dying What you can learn from people on their death bead The last 2 episodes could not be more apart in terms of relevance and superficiality Not to bring any sort of judgment against aesthetics Ultimately talking about end of life and lessons about life through death versus how to make your skin look better are about two opposite ends of the spectrum Nevertheless, it is a spectrum and we can find value in talking about everything along it We try not to do too much summary in these episodes because the show notes do such a great job of that Episodes on fertility with Paul Turek and Paula Amato: insights on all things male and female fertility [4:45] #351 ‒ Male fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility, and navigating testosterone replacement therapy | Paul Turek, M.D. (June 2, 2025) #352 ‒ Female fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility and PCOS, and understanding the IVF process | Paula Amato, M.D. (June 9, 2025) *** From a story standpoint, the idea that conception is difficult is an understatement A single ejaculation releases about a 100 million sperm Fewer than 5 million of them even make their way past the cervical mucus Ultimately only somewhere between 100 and 500 reach the fallopian tube Then only 1 goes on to fertilize the egg Now, there might be 20 that reach the egg, but there’s this really cool force field that comes up the minute the first sperm touches the egg It creates a chemical barrier that prevents any others from fertilizing, otherwise you’d have this devastating situation of too much genetic material being brought in A couple of interesting things that made Peter go “Wow!” Sperm are chemotactic They’re basically chemical guided missiles that make their way to the egg, and they can traverse 15 centimeters of distance within the vagina to the fallopian tube within minutes It’s important to understand, given how small a sperm is, that is the analog of a human swimming 20 miles in the ocean in that same period of a few minutes By the way, even though we didn’t go into this in the podcast, think about the energy requirement to do that and you kind of understand what the motor and the ATP generation is like in one of those things Testes, like the brain, have kind of a specialized blood tissue barrier It’s very immune privileged and it protects developing sperm from antibodies It also means that drugs or toxins that can cross it such as certain types of chemotherapies can actually be disproportionately damaging It’s for that reason that a lot of men who are undergoing chemotherapy will choose to do a sperm donation prior Spermatogenesis (or the generation of sperm) follows a clock of about 74 days If a guy gets his sperm tested and it comes back that something’s not right, and if you’re trying to make interventions around sperm health You’re going to need 2-3 months of trying a corrective intervention before you can determine if it’s worked That’s how long it takes to go through the cycle On that intervention piece, one of the things that was talked about was bike seats. As someone who spent a lot of time on a bike, did that surprise you? Yeah Peter has always been pretty mindful of bike seats, and he’s been very fortunate despite how much time he used to spend on a bike that he’s never had any issues Paul points out in the podcast that it’s not really a big concern for fertility, but it is much more a concern around erectile function, based on your anatomy and based on the type of seat you use You can really traumatize the arteries and nerves that impact erections ⇒ What we tell all of our patients, if they’re spending a lot of time on a bike, we have recommendations on bike seats that they should be using Peter has 2 bikes: one for inside, one for outside He has different bike seats on them because he got them at different times, but they’re basically the identical type of seat A seat that has the middle of the saddle is largely absent so the ischial tuberosities (your sit bones) are doing the supporting but nothing else A couple brands of bike seats Peter recommends Top USA Ism [shown below] As silly as it sounds, Peter recommends people buy 3 and try them out and figure out the one that’s most comfortable Buy from somebody who will let you return them Figure 1. Bike seat where the middle of the saddle is largely absent. Image credit: ism Back to fertility, Paul talked a lot about what his workup is for patients. Remind people of that and how you apply that to your patients This is not something Peter considers his practice remotely sophisticated in We refer out for fertility issues to people like Paul or Paula What we learned here is really valuable for everybody listening because you can certainly do a lot on your own to force the issue “If you remember nothing else from Paul’s podcast, you know what you should remember is that males are often the driver of fertility issues.”‒ Peter Attia So when a couple is struggling with fertility, it’s very common to just assume that the issue lies with the woman, and that’s not the case In fact, Paul mentioned that only 23% of males are even evaluated for fertility prior to moving to IVF When you consider the cost, the economics of IVF, to think that 3/4s of men are not even evaluated for fertility issues before proceeding to that is crazy Especially when you consider that 40% of male infertility is driven by one thing: a varicocele ⇒ A varicocele is a very easy thing to correct with a very minor procedure in a male To think that 40% of male infertility alone is driven by a varicocele, you realize that there’s an enormous opportunity here Paul’s workup for male infertility Involves a very thorough patient history and physical exam A varicocele is something that any urologist will be able to pick up on a physical exam Semen analysis, which he typically repeats twice across 3 weeks along with hormone levels, and by looking at FSH, LH, and testosterone You can figure out if a guy is taking exogenous testosterone Sometimes a guy will just fail to mention that he’s taking exogenous testosterone, that he’s been on it for years and years and years It just doesn’t cross his mind what the impact of that could be on his fertility Exogenous testosterone is effectively male birth control Within 2-3 months of taking 200 mg testosterone per week, 95% of men will effectively be azoospermatic or oligospermatic It means they basically can’t reproduce Peter doesn’t know what that would be at a 100 mg per week He doesn’t know how much longer it would take 200 milligrams a week is a really big dose ‒ we’ve never had a patient take that much testosterone Typically we’re sort of in the 80-120 milligram per week So if it takes you 8-12 weeks to become azoospermic or oligospermic, at 200 milligrams per week, it might take twice that long The point is in relatively short order, exogenous testosterone will render you unable to reproduce The reversibility of the effects of exogenous testosterone on sperm production Basically within 3-6 months of testosterone cessation within the first year, you will resume sperm production There are of course other ways around it We have men in our practice who are taking testosterone exogenously, but who also want to continue with their reproductive potential, and so we’ll typically add hCG (somewhere between 250 and 500 IU twice weekly) to maintain sperm count ⇒ We prefer using just hCG at a higher dose as opposed to exogenous testosterone if we can in younger men {end of show notes preview}",

      "title": "It’s time to remove warning labels on hormone replacement products",
      "content": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exists for the purpose of protecting the public by ensuring any products on the market are safe and efficacious. This, of course, is an extraordinarily worthwhile cause, but even the noblest of missions can occasionally lead to a few missteps, and on certain rare occasions, the FDA issues warnings and restrictions where they aren’t sufficiently justified by research. Such was the case in early 2003 when, in the wake of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the FDA issued a black box warning on estrogen products. The label warns that such products can increase risk of stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer, and the inclusion of this warning on estrogen products contributed substantially to the subsequent trend toward fear and avoidance of HRT among many providers and postmenopausal women. Now, more than two decades later, we have new hope that the 2003 decision might finally be reversed. Last week, in a panel discussion organized by FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, experts emphatically called for the removal of the warnings from HRT products. If the agency acts on the panel’s recommendation, the decision would constitute an enormous victory for women’s health. But what prompted the addition of the warning in the first place, and why has it now been re-opened for debate? The cause of the alarm When women experience menopause, levels of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone plummet, giving rise not only to classical vasomotor symptoms (e.g., hot flashes and night sweats) but also to many other negative effects on quality of life and physical health, such as losses in bone mineral density and muscle strength, changes in mood, and a decline in libido. Hormone replacement therapy, which involves supplementing the body’s low post-menopause levels with exogenous estrogen (and, for women with an intact uterus, exogenous progesterone), offers an effective means of attenuating these symptoms, and as a result, this approach steadily grew in popularity throughout the latter half of the the 20th century. But the trend came to an abrupt halt following the 2002 publication of results from a series of two landmark randomized trials — collectively known as the Women’s Health Initiative, or WHI — on the health effects of estrogen alone and of estrogen plus a synthetic form of progesterone.1 Prompted by earlier observational data suggesting that HRT might be cardioprotective, the two trials examined the relationship between the use of menopausal HRT and risks for various chronic diseases. Yet results from these studies failed to substantiate the alleged reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease with HRT. Even worse, the WHI investigators reported that the use of estrogen plus progesterone increased the incidence of breast cancer by 26% (95% CI: 0-59%) relative to placebo, as well as increasing risk of stroke by 41% (95% CI: 7-85%). The findings were widely publicized and ultimately led the FDA to require warning labels on any estrogen products regarding potential health risks. The impact was profound: within three years, the use of HRT had dropped by over 70% and has remained low ever since.2,3 But both the WHI results and the about-face reaction that they inspired have been mired in controversy from the very beginning — and rightly so. A closer look at the design and results of the WHI trials reveals several holes in the broad interpretation that HRT increases health risks.

Further, the two groups did not differ in the number of breast cancer deaths. So although women on HRT were slightly more likely to receive a breast cancer diagnosis over the average follow-up of 5.2 years, this didn’t equate to a higher risk of dying from breast cancer. Of course, cancer is a terrible disease that can cause great suffering even when it doesn’t result in death, so the increase in incidence itself would be a significant cause for concern — if it weren’t for the fact that even this finding is riddled with flaws. The discrepancy in risk disappeared altogether when considering only women with no HRT prior to the study (roughly 75% of the women in the study), and the apparent increase in risk in the full cohort (including women with and without prior HRT) wasn’t due to an unusually high incidence in those on HRT, but to an unusually low incidence in those on placebo who had previously used HRT. These problems alone would raise plenty of doubts about the WHI’s conclusions, but we also have compelling evidence that the increase in risk was specific to the outdated progestogen used by the WHI. The estrogen used in these trials was conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), and the progestogen (used only in the trial among women with intact uteruses) was medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) — the dominant forms of HRT at the time that the research began in the 1990s. Yet the apparent increase in breast cancer risk was only seen in the trial involving CEE plus MPA. Indeed, a subsequent analysis of WHI data on CEE alone versus placebo revealed that the CEE group had nearly a 20% lower risk of breast cancer incidence than the placebo group, as well as 40% reduction in breast cancer mortality relative to placebo by 20 years of follow-up.4 These results strongly suggest that MPA, and not estrogen, is responsible for any elevated risk observed in the WHI and that estrogen itself may even be protective. MPA is no longer used in HRT, having been replaced primarily by micronized progesterone. Thus, the WHI’s results are effectively irrelevant for modern medical practice, yet the FDA’s label nevertheless continues to flag all HRT products with this outdated (at best) warning about breast cancer. Flaws in the conclusions on cardiovascular risk A major motivation for the WHI trials was the observation from large-scale epidemiology studies that the use of HRT was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The correlation makes some mechanistic sense, as the drop in estrogen that takes place during menopause tends to cause an increase in visceral fat accumulation, which can lead to other risk factors for CVD, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Yet the WHI’s reports indicated that HRT may do more harm than good from a cardiovascular perspective — the researchers observed increases in risk of stroke both in women on estrogen alone (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.07-1.85) and on estrogen plus progesterone (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.10-1.77). However, these numbers are a bit misleading from a statistical point of view. Each of the WHI trials involved assessment of several different outcomes, essentially constituting many unique tests within the same trial. While this may create a richer dataset, it also creates what’s known as a “multiple comparisons problem”: the more tests you run, the greater the probability of finding a result that’s statistically “significant” but does not actually represent a true association. This issue can be circumvented by statistical adjustments that effectively narrow the range over which a given result would be considered significant, and indeed, when the WHI researchers applied such a correction to their results, stroke risk was statistically equivalent between HRT and placebo groups. Even if we take the hazard ratios at face value, the observed discrepancy in risk again has questionable relevance for modern HRT usage. The oral CEE formulation used in the WHI does increase blood viscosity by a small degree, which might conceivably lead to more blood clots and strokes, but in modern practice, oral estrogens have largely been replaced by transdermal formulations, which do not raise blood viscosity and have accordingly been shown to have no negative impacts on risk of blood clots.5,6 Finally, when we expand our view to other metrics of cardiovascular health, HRT appears to have a net positive effect. While the WHI identified no significant benefits in this area, a 2015 Cochrane meta-analysis of 19 RCTs (including over 40,000 women) found that HRT reduced risk of CV events by 48% (RR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29-0.96) when initiated within 10 years of menopause (though this analysis showed no benefit for CVD when HRT was initiated >10 years postmenopause).7 The cost to quality of life In breaking down the specific numbers and subgroups from WHI data to expose the multitude of faults, it can perhaps be easy to lose sight of the true cost of those flawed conclusions. The fear (and FDA warning) that they inspired led an entire generation of women and their healthcare providers to eschew HRT, a treatment that has demonstrated the potential to drastically improve quality of life and physical health following menopause. The main reason women start HRT is to manage vasomotor symptoms, which, apart from being unpleasant on their own, can also negatively impact sleep, mood, and ability to engage in everyday activities. Numerous large trials and meta-analyses have consistently established HRT as the single most effective known treatment for these symptoms, with most women experiencing a symptom reduction of 60-90%.8 But the known benefits of HRT extend even beyond the realm of these classical menopausal symptoms. Estrogen also serves as an important inhibitor of bone resorption, which is why so many women experience substantial losses in bone mineral density after estrogen levels fall during menopause, which in turn increases risk of debilitating fractures. Replacing estrogen with HRT has been shown in many studies (including the WHI) to improve bone mineral density and reduce fracture risk,9,10 allowing women to maintain higher levels of physical function well beyond the menopausal transition. In the aftermath of the WHI publications, millions of women have been deprived of these positive effects. The faulty belief that potential risks with HRT outweigh potential benefits persists to this day, in large part due to the continued requirement for warning labels on HRT products. Thus, the true message of the recent FDA panel becomes clear: remove the black box label to stem the growing list of women who have suffered needlessly. Time for a change The FDA panel’s recommendation is no guarantee that the warning label will soon be abandoned. Many remain skeptical about HRT and have criticized the panel as trivializing potential health risks, yet those on this side of the debate tend to point to a lack of large-scale randomized trials using newer formulations rather than addressing the holes in the WHI data or pointing to any other evidence of cancer or stroke risk. In other words, this argument has no basis in evidence at all — they’re saying that, in the absence of rigorous evidence that HRT doesn’t raise breast cancer risk (despite general safety data), we have to assume that it does. Just like how there have never been any randomized trials investigating whether wearing blue jeans increases risk of colon cancer relative to wearing slacks, so we shouldn’t trivialize the risks of blue jeans and should avoid them as a general rule. See how little sense this makes? I encourage readers to listen to the panel’s arguments for yourselves, as the whole discussion is currently available on the FDA’s YouTube feed. To echo the words of recent podcast guest Dr. Rachel Rubin in her presentation as part of the FDA panel: “[the] box label that was blanketly placed on all products in 2003 has no data to support its existence … 22 years later (and consensus guidelines later), this deserves another look.” Indeed, between shaky evidence of risk and the emergence of newer and safer HRT formulations, it’s time we finally break down the barriers and fears that keep women from living healthy and full lives long after menopause.

      "title": "#357 ‒ A new era of longevity science: models of aging, human trials of rapamycin, biological clocks, promising compounds, and lifestyle interventions | Brian Kennedy, Ph.D.",
      "content": "Brian Kennedy is a renowned biologist, leader in aging research, and director of the Center for Healthy Longevity at the National University of Singapore. In this episode, Brian shares insights from ongoing human aging studies, including clinical trials of rapamycin and how dosing strategies, timing, and exercise may influence outcomes. He presents two key models of aging—one as a linear accumulation of biological decline and the other as an exponential rise in mortality risk—and explains why traditional models of aging fall short. He also explains why most current aging biomarkers lack clinical utility and describes how his team is working to develop a more actionable biological clock. Additional topics include the potential of compounds like alpha-ketoglutarate, urolithin A, and NAD boosters, along with how lifestyle interventions—such as VO2 max training, strength building, and the use of GLP-1 and SGLT2 drugs—may contribute to longer, healthier lives.

Show Notes Brian’s journey from the Buck Institute to Singapore, and the global evolution of aging research [2:45] Brian used to run an institute called the Buck Institute Tell folks a little bit about what the Buck is and what you did there It was the first institute solely devoted to understanding aging and longevity, and it started around 2000 with some money that was donated by a woman who died in Marin County north of San Francisco Brian was the second CEO there in 2010 There were about 20 faculty at the time all devoted to either aging or aspects of aging, very basic science As you can imagine in the 2000s at around 2010, that was a significant component of the aging research field It was still a very small field, and so the goal was really to help that institute grow It was tough times in the 2010s because the funding levels were low, and it was right before the real interest in aging and longevity happened around 2017, 2018 So we were really struggling to keep the doors open and the Buck’s doing a lot better now as well as the rest of the aging field At the time that you were there, how much of the funding came from NIH and how much came from either donations or industry? It was heavily oriented to NIH and our goal was to get more industry funding We started 7 companies when Brian was there, some of which are still hanging around We also really tried to ramp up philanthropy, but philanthropy for aging wasn’t really happening until around 2017, 2018 when people started really getting the idea that you could slow aging and prevent all these diseases and stay healthy and functional The faculty there are quite the star-studded cast Eric Verdin is there (he came after Brian left and took over as CEO) Judith Campisi was there until she passed away Henry Jasper was there, he’s now gone on to Genentech Gordon Lithgow and a bunch of other people working on aging It was a good group of people for sure You alluded to something that happened in 2017, 2018 that brought a lot more interest into the field, what do you think led to this interest? You just reach an inflection point, and it’s really hard to know what triggers it Calico started a few years before that Google’s alphabet companies that was focused on longevity They’ve not been very open about what they’re doing, but it triggered a lot of publicity for longevity field It got Silicon Valley interested Brian and Matt used this slide that you have aging pointing to all these different diseases [shown below] Figure 1. Diseases related to aging. Image credit: Brian Kennedy Brian explains, “We started using that slide around 2005, and we were making the point around healthspan shortly afterwards and really this idea of preventing disease and keeping people healthy, interacting earlier.” Now Brian is so sick of that slide; he can’t look at it anymore Back then, there were a few scientists doing it and it finally helped trigger a movement (hopefully) Do you think the field would’ve accelerated sooner had it not been for some notable setbacks? For example, resveratrol Peter doesn’t remember exactly when GSK bought resveratrol, around 2006, 2007 By about 2010, it was clear to him that was not going to work GSK probably knew sooner Do you think that that type of hype with nothing to show for it was a negative force in that equation and maybe this inflection point could have happened sooner,and it could have been easier 7 raised funds if there had been less of those examples? It’s hard to know It’s unfortunate that investors made money off that deal when what was developed wasn’t going anywhere It probably slowed things down a little bit because there’s always this doubt about whether you can slow the aging process When you have a major effort that’s triggered around trying to do that, even though they ended up focusing on disease, and when something like that fails, it probably does slow down other investor interests We can talk about the struggles of longevity biotech companies in that way Today you’re in Singapore; tell me what you’re doing there Brian has one foot in academics and one foot in the private sector these days On the academic side, he’s really focused on targeting aging And that comes back to what he alluded to with the biotech companies a minute ago: a lot of them are targeting aging pathways, but to raise money and get their drugs tested, they have to turn to some disease indication (which is understandable) The companies he’s involved with do that too, but that’s not what we really want to do “What we really want to do is slow the aging process and keep you from getting sick.”‒ Brian Kennedy In an academic setting, we can test that clinically We basically have a whole range of animal models, a pipeline from yeast, worms, flies, killifish, mice, and humans (billion years of evolution there) We bring interventions in at the right place, validate them, really believing the idea that if it works across different model organisms, it’s more likely to work in humans Then we design human clinical intervention studies to validate that they’re targeting the aging process Brian adds, “I don’t think anybody knows exactly how to do that yet (including us), but we’re doing our best and learning as we go.” How is the institute you’re at funded? [Brian is at the Centre for Healthy Longevity at National University in Singapore] Mostly through the university and the government in Singapore, but we also have some philanthropy, and we do contract sponsored research to test interventions from companies sometimes How many PIs are there? Brian runs a program that has about 35 PIs in it But a lot of them are doing other things They’re not all focused on that one concept he just spoke about They have their projects around Alzheimer’s disease Or we just have this guy Michael Chee, who’s working on sleep and aging, which is so understudied It’s kind of like an academic department where people have their own projects they’re focusing on Is there any department at a US university that brings together as many people that are focused on specifics of aging this way? Brian doesn’t think so, although it depends on how you define aging If you branch it out to cancer then there are, but he’s not sure if that is focused on the actual aging process Rethinking the biology of aging: why models like the hallmarks of aging fall short [9:45] Peter wants to start with a question that he thinks they’ll end up coming back to because it’s so fundamental Peter adds, “I enjoy going down the rabbit hole of fundamental questions in physics.” What do we think is actually causing aging? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "A ketosis-inducing supplement shows preliminary promise for neuroprotection",
      "content": "Ketogenic diets — characterized by extreme reduction in carbohydrate intake to induce a state of nutritional ketosis, in which the body relies on ketone bodies derived from fat oxidation as a major source of fuel — have been touted for numerous health benefits, including effects on the brain, an organ that normally relies exclusively on carbohydrates (i.e., glucose) for energy. But for many, the high-fat and low-carb requirements with these diets can be challenging to maintain, and as a result, increasing attention has been devoted to possible strategies for achieving ketosis without the need for such strict dietary limitations. One option is supplementation with 1,3-butanediol (BD), which, upon ingestion, is converted in the liver to the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), thus inducing ketosis without dietary intervention. But although we know that BD is capable of raising βHB levels, we have relatively little information on how this might recreate the benefits of a ketogenic diet. Investigators Cigliano et al. recently sought to fill this gap, examining whether treatment with BD led to discernible neurological effects in rats.1 What did they discover, and how might their findings apply to humans? About the study This study assessed several cellular-level readouts related to the health and function of neurons in the hippocampus, an area of the brain that is critical for memory and learning. Over the 14-day treatment period, rats in the experimental (BD) group were given BD through their normal food. Because BD — like a ketogenic diet itself — tends to decrease calorie intake and lead to an overall reduction in body weight, two groups of untreated control animals were also included: 1) ad-libitum controls (AL controls), which had unlimited access to food; and 2) pair-fed controls (PF controls), which were restricted to eating only as many calories as the BD animals consumed. Thus, the authors were able to disentangle any benefits due to caloric restriction from those of BD treatment per se. After the 14 days of treatment, BD animals exhibited significant improvements relative to AL controls in nearly all metrics of inflammation and oxidative stress in the hippocampus. (Note that precise quantitation is challenging with the methodology employed in this study, but differences across metrics between BD and AL groups generally ranged from ~10-50% relative to the AL group.) For inflammatory markers, results from PF controls tended to be at intermediate levels between the AL and BD groups, while markers of oxidative stress generally did not differ significantly between BD and PF animals. These data suggest that calorie restriction likely accounted for all effects of BD on oxidative stress and partly accounted for apparent improvements in neuroinflammation. However, not all benefits observed with BD treatment could be explained by lower energy intake. Markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress — which can itself arise from inflammation or oxidative damage and is often a sign of cellular stress more generally — were reduced in BD-treated animals relative to both the AL and PF groups, while levels of BDNF (a critical protein for neuronal growth and survival) were increased relative to the control groups. Accordingly, Cigliano et al. found that two key proteins for synaptic function (synaptophysin and synaptotagmin) were also elevated exclusively in animals that had received BD. These results collectively suggest that induction of ketosis through BD administration promotes neuronal health and neural signaling in the hippocampus.

They did not include any functional assessments of memory or other domains of cognitive function. Indeed, given that the animals were cognitively and neurologically healthy at baseline, the intervention likely would have been too short to see any meaningful divergence between groups in functional tests. A two-week intervention in a rat is roughly equivalent to one year for humans, whereas dementia or age-related memory loss can take decades to develop. Therefore, determining whether the neuroprotective effects of BD treatment are truly clinically significant for cognitive function would require much longer experiments. The investigators also did not test BD treatment against a true ketogenic diet, which might have provided valuable insight as to how closely the supplement mimics the physiological effects of diet-induced ketosis. It’s very possible that the apparent benefits of BD would pale in comparison to those of a ketogenic diet itself, and when we look more closely at the degree of ketosis achieved in this study, we have some reason to believe that this could indeed be the case. While βHB levels in BD-treated rats were over double the levels of the control groups, this translated to a serum concentration of just under 0.6 mM — a mere fraction of the levels seen in rat studies using true ketogenic diets.2,3 Still, this study adds to a growing body of literature that ketosis-inducing supplements can reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress and improve neurological health. Perhaps more importantly, Cigliano et al. also report distinct effects of BD treatment relative to equivalent calorie restriction. Researchers have long debated whether the apparent benefits seen with ketosis are truly unique to this unusual metabolic state or instead are merely due to reduced energy intake and reductions in body fat. The present results offer compelling evidence that calorie restriction alone cannot fully account for improvements in inflammation and synaptic function, as BD-treated animals diverged substantially from both AL controls and PF controls in these areas. Looking ahead Again, we’re a very long way off from any possible regulatory approval for BD as a treatment or prevention strategy for neurodegenerative disease or cognitive impairment, though 1,3-butanediol has been granted GRAS (“Generally Recognized As Safe”) status by the FDA. It’s also worth noting that a couple of small, early-phase clinical trials are currently underway to investigate the compound’s efficacy and safety for blood glucose management (NCT05273411) and alcohol use disorder (NCT06559995). However the more immediate utility of these data is probably in the simple proof-of-principle that ketosis has unique benefits — beyond those of calorie restriction — for neurological health at the cellular level, which might translate to long-term cognitive protection. Though this remains an area of debate, it should be encouraging to those considering a ketogenic diet, as the breadth and magnitude of the effects observed by Cigliano et al. are difficult to deny. Further, despite the lack of a control group on a ketogenic diet, we can nevertheless conclude that positive effects can be achieved (at least to some extent) with ketosis-inducing supplements, potentially offering an effective alternative for those who struggle to adhere to strict ketogenic diets. Preliminary as these results may be, they offer intriguing possibilities that merit further exploration.

Examples: Age: Risk of cognitive decline increases monotonically with age (i.e., steadily, without plateau). Sex: Women have 2x the risk of Alzheimer’s compared to men. Not fully explained by longer life expectancy. Peter suspects sudden estrogen withdrawal during menopause may play a major role. Possible link between HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) and reduced risk, but more data is needed. Genetics: Most notably, the APOE e4 genotype significantly increases Alzheimer’s risk. Other genetic contributors exist as well. Modifiable Risk Factors Definition: These are areas individuals can influence through lifestyle and health management. Key Modifiable Risks: Obesity: Associated with a 60% increase in relative risk for dementia. Risk becomes more meaningful with age due to increasing baseline risk. Type 2 Diabetes: Raises dementia risk by ~50%. Risk increases with disease duration: every 5 years adds ~25% more risk. Hypertension: Also raises dementia risk by ~60%. Dyslipidemia (High LDL cholesterol): Each 1 mmol/L (≈40 mg/dL) increase in LDL is linked to an 8–10% increase in all-cause dementia risk. Genetic Susceptibility & Interaction with Modifiable Risks APOE e4 carriers are more vulnerable to the above modifiable risks. For example, a person with diabetes and APOE e4 has a 5.5x greater risk of dementia compared to a diabetic without the APOE e4 variant. This shows gene-environment interaction—modifiable risks carry greater impact in genetically susceptible individuals. Summary of Prevention Strategy Target metabolic health aggressively by optimizing: Blood pressure → Target: ≤ 120/80 mmHg. Lipid levels → Keep LDL and other harmful lipids as low as reasonably possible (with diminishing returns at very low levels). Insulin sensitivity → Reduce insulin resistance through diet, exercise, and lifestyle interventions. {end of show notes preview}",

      "title": "A practical guide to tick prevention and peace of mind during time outdoors",
      "content": "Summer has finally arrived, and with the warmth comes a seasonal threat — ticks. You may have already found one crawling up your pant leg or have pulled one off of your dog. Maybe you’ve even noticed more of them this year than you usually do, and you’d be correct — CDC data show tick bites are up this year compared to recent years.1 In May, emergency departments recorded 134 visits for tick bites per 100,000 visits, compared to 112 last year. This trend has continued into June, with 130 visits per 100,000 versus 89 the previous year. Ticks are responsible for approximately 95% of all vector-borne disease cases (like Lyme disease) in the United States, so an increase in tick bites is not something to completely ignore. If you’ve found yourself searching the internet for “tick removal,” “how to kill a tick,” and “can dogs get Lyme disease,” you can understand that most of us could benefit from a more systematic approach to tick prevention and management. (And yes, dogs can get Lyme disease.) Despite their impact on human — and pet —health, many people remain underprepared for the risks these small creatures pose. The good news? With the right knowledge and strategies, tick-borne illnesses are largely preventable. Understanding the landscape of tick-borne diseases While Lyme disease gets most of the attention — and for good reason, given its status as the most common tick-transmitted illness, as well as an illness with potential long-term consequences — the reality is that ticks carry a diverse portfolio of pathogens. Anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis cause flu-like symptoms, babesiosis affects red blood cells, Rocky Mountain spotted fever can be life-threatening, and the fascinating alpha-gal syndrome can trigger a persistent allergy to red meat. While ticks remain active so long as the temperature is above freezing, the risk of tick-borne illnesses is highest in the warmer months — from April through September, peaking in June and July. Risk also depends on geographical location. Tick species vary by location, and different species can carry different types of disease-causing bacteria. Even within a specific species, the proportion of ticks that do versus don’t carry disease-causing bacteria can vary based on geography. For example, the percentage of black-legged ticks carrying Lyme disease bacteria can range from 1% to 50% depending on your specific location. In the United States, the northeastern region sees the heaviest burden, followed by the Midwest.

A combination of physical and chemical barriers, along with certain behavioral modifications, can drastically reduce the likelihood of bites. The first line of defense between you and ticks is clothing. While long socks, pants, and sleeves may be excessive for everyday activities (especially in the summer heat), they become more reasonable when venturing into tick-rich areas, like wooded hiking trails or fields with tall grass. Light-colored clothes provide an additional advantage, as they make ticks more visible against the fabric and allow for easier detection. For added protection, clothing can be treated with permethrin, a chemical that kills ticks on contact rather than merely repelling them. Concentrations of 0.5% permethrin can be applied to clothing and gear, or pre-treated clothing is commercially available. Permethrin-treated clothing effectively kills ticks through multiple wash cycles, but periodic retreatment per manufacturer recommendations is advisable. While skin-contact with permethrin is generally safe (it is applied topically in higher concentrations to kill lice and scabies), the added effort of treating clothes may only be worth it for dedicated outdoors gear. However, permethrin-treated clothes only protect the skin that is covered by the clothing. For skin not covered, an insect repellent such as DEET (≤30%) or picaridin (20%) can be used. Plant-based formulations (e.g., oil of lemon eucalyptus) are also available but are less effective against ticks and shorter-lasting than DEET or picaridin. Regardless of the chemical barrier you choose, ensure it is EPA-registered, meaning that the company has verified the repellency of their product. Follow the application instructions closely, and take special precautions around pets (for example, DEET is toxic to dogs and should not be applied anywhere a dog might lick). Of course, you could just completely avoid ticks by staying away from tick-rich environments, like tall grass, brush areas, and leaf litter. For the many that refuse to make this concession, a quick tick check in the summer months can be an easy addition to the daily routine. Take a minute or two when changing your clothes or in the shower to scan your body, paying close attention to behind and inside ears, along the hairline and scalp, around the waist and underwear line, behind knees, between toes, around the buttocks, and in the genital area, as ticks like to hide in moist, warm areas. Ticks also tend to congregate around pressure points and can often be found under waistbands, backpack straps, bra straps, or anywhere with elastic. Don’t forget to check your pets as well — even if they are treated for tick prevention, they can still carry ticks into your house. Washing both your body and clothes can help get rid of any extras you might miss from a tick check. Ticks can be smaller than you’d expect — from the size of a poppy seed to the size of a sesame seed — making them easy to miss at a quick glance. Placing clothes in the dryer first for six minutes on high heat will kill any ticks present.4 If washing is required first, use water heated to at least 54 °C (130 °F). Again, this extra step is most important for outdoor gear that is more likely to come in contact with ticks, and not for your daily laundry. Safe tick removal and prophylaxis Despite your best prevention efforts, you’ll occasionally find an attached tick on yourself, your kids, or your pets. Proper removal is straightforward: use fine-tipped tweezers or a specialized tick removal device (e.g., a “tick key”) to grasp the tick as close to your skin as possible, then pull straight up with steady pressure. Skip the folk remedies — no flames, nail polish, or petroleum jelly, as these can cause the tick to release more bacteria. Clean the area with soap and water afterward, and flush the tick down the toilet. Even after you’ve removed a tick itself, it’s possible that any bacteria it may have released while attached could still cause disease. Thus, the next question is whether prophylactic action is required, and this decision depends on the level of risk involved. For most tick bites, the approach is watchful waiting — note the date of the bite and monitor for symptoms like fever, chills, muscle aches, or rash over the following weeks, especially the characteristic bullseye rash of Lyme disease. However, for higher-risk situations, early antibiotic treatment can be highly effective against most tick-borne illnesses. Factors impacting risk include the type of tick, the length of time it was attached (an engorged, blood-filled tick suggests prolonged attachment), and the overall proportion of disease-carrying ticks in your area. For instance, a black-legged tick attached for 36 hours or more in an area where Lyme disease is common would likely warrant prophylactic treatment with single-dose doxycycline. The CDC’s Tick Bite Bot can help you decide whether to seek professional care, and the decision on prophylaxis should ultimately involve an individualized risk assessment with your healthcare provider.5 Safe enjoyment of the outdoors Summer is a time to enjoy the outdoors, and while the threat of tick-borne illnesses may warrant certain precautions, it should not prevent you from engaging in the outdoor activities you love. To keep things in perspective, it’s worth pointing out that the risk from any individual tick encounter is quite low. Not all ticks carry bacteria, and transmission for the most likely disease (Lyme) typically requires 36+ hours of attachment — giving you plenty of time to find and remove ticks. This is why daily tick checks are so effective. A quick scan while showering can catch ticks before they’ve had time to transmit anything, with the shower itself washing away ticks you might miss. Still, the more frequently you experience bites, the greater the risk — especially in areas where disease-bearing ticks are fairly common. Thus, preventing bites in the first place can add further peace of mind. When heading into tick territory, the strategy is simple: wear light-colored clothing, use EPA-registered repellents, and do those daily checks. For extended outdoor activities, consider permethrin-treated gear. Think of tick prevention like checking your rearview mirror — a simple habit that becomes automatic and keeps you safe. The goal isn’t avoidance, but easy routines that dramatically reduce your risk while letting you enjoy the outdoors with confidence.

      "content": "Through wearable devices and other at-home technology, we have more access than ever to information about our health. Among the most ubiquitous metrics for at-home monitoring are those related to cardiovascular function — in particular, resting heart rate, heart rate recovery, heart rate variability, VO2 max, and blood pressure — and tracking these metrics over time can certainly offer critical information to facilitate a personalized, preventative approach to assessing and improving our health. And yet, there’s a catch: while these metrics have the potential to provide value, their utility is wholly dependent on the accuracy of their measurement and the appropriate interpretation and application of the resulting data. Indeed, inaccurate measurement and incorrect interpretation can easily have a net negative effect — causing undue health anxiety or false senses of security. Thus, we have created this user guide for laying out what these metrics mean, why they’re important, how to measure them accurately, and how to interpret and improve them. For those who are just starting out in their journey toward better health, this guide can help cut through confusion about how to get started with using these metrics effectively, while for those who are already entrenched in the world of fitness tracking, it may provide valuable insights on common pitfalls to avoid and how to maximize utility of each data point.",

      "content": "In this episode from July 2022, Peter dives deep into the topic of bone health and explains why this is an important topic for everyone, from children to the elderly. He begins with an overview of bone mineral density, how it’s measured, how it changes over the course of life, and the variability between sexes largely due to changes in estrogen levels. From there he provides insights into ways that one can improve bone health, from exercise to nutrition supplements to drugs. Additionally, Peter discusses what happens when one may be forced to be sedentary (e.g., bedrest) and how you can work to minimize the damage during these periods.

Bone is a living tissue It’s easy to forget this fact and think of bone as somewhat inert But bone is heavily vascularized Bone is an organ that plays a very important role in a lot of things Common bone types Cortical/compact bone is what forms the “shaft” and the exterior of long bones Femur, humerus, etc. — they have the long shaft and then the nubbins at the end The shaft of that is the cortical or compact bone You also have the trabecular bone/spongy bone There are some differences amongst those in terms of their vascularization and things like that For the purpose of this discussion… when discussing the compact or cortical bone, Peter is referring to the shaft And when speaking about the spongy/trabecular part, he’s talking about the end Bone marrow Marrow is important because it is what’s producing our white cells and our red blood cells In a post COVID world, it’s important to understand that the memory B cells and memory T-cells that are going to provide lasting immunity against this virus and other viruses, reside in the bone marrow The whole purpose of being infected and then having a subsequent infection that’s less devastating, (and purpose of being vaccinated) for the same reason is to have memory B cells and T-cells that are sitting there in the bone marrow that can respond immediately and quickly upon reintroduction of the same antigen Bone mineral density (BMD), minerals in bone, role of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and more [9:30] Osteoblasts and osteoclasts Osteoblasts—“B” for blast These are responsible for building bone by producing collagen bone matrix and mineralizing it Osteoclasts These remove bone by reabsorbing calcified bone and the matrix So osteoblasts contribute to increasing bone mineral density Osteoclasts the opposite This exists in an equilibrium—We’re constantly remodeling bone, adding to and subtracting from this and basically turning over calcium Bone minerals: {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Research Worth Sharing: July 2025 Edition",
      "content": "Welcome to another edition of “Research Worth Sharing” — a roundup of recent research that we’ve found interesting and which we hope might provide worthwhile insights to others as well. Exercise improves survival odds after a cancer diagnosis Why we’re interested: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world, but results from a new meta-analysis suggest that exercise may help improve survival odds for those facing this deadly disease.1 Analyzing data from prospective cohort and case-control studies across the four most common types of cancer (i.e., cancers of the breast, lung, prostate, and colorectum), researchers assessed the relationship between post-diagnosis physical activity and both cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. What they showed: Results showed a consistent and substantial association between physical activity and probability of cancer survival across cancer types. For instance, physically active individuals exhibited a 31% (95% CI: 25–37%) reduction in risk of breast cancer mortality over the follow-up period relative to patients who were physically inactive, while risk reductions for mortality from lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer were 24% (95% CI: 16–31%), 27% (95% CI: 13–38%), and 29% (95% CI: 20–37%), respectively. Physical activity also lowered risk of all-cause mortality by 22–37%, depending on cancer type. Importantly, this analysis was based entirely on observational data, and there’s a significant risk of “healthy user bias” — individuals who exercise following a cancer diagnosis are likely to adhere to a number of other health-promoting behaviors that could influence results. However, other work has provided plausible mechanistic links between exercise and cancer survival — in large part due to the effects of physical activity on immune function — which can increase our confidence in this association. Unfortunately, this study did not offer any insights on “dose dependency” or the amount of exercise necessary to see such a survival benefit, but this may also depend on the individual and their specific cancer case. If you’re facing a battle with cancer, be sure to confer with your physician about your exercise habits and what makes sense during your course of treatment. doi: 10.1007/s11357-025-01647-0 A ketogenic diet may help preserve lean mass for those on tirzepatide Why we’re interested: GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs (GLP1-RAs) like semaglutide (trade names Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (trade names Mounjaro, Zepbound) have proven to be game-changers in combatting the obesity epidemic. However, as with most forms of weight loss, the loss of fat mass on these medications is accompanied by a degree of lean mass loss. Maximizing improvements in body composition and metabolic health on GLP1-RAs requires that we minimize lean mass losses without compromising fat mass losses, and results from a recent trial suggest that a ketogenic diet may help patients to achieve this goal.2 What they showed: In this 12-week pilot study, 60 participants with overweight or obesity were divided into two groups: 1) a low-calorie diet (LCD) group (50% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 30% fat); and 2) a low-energy ketogenic therapy (LEKT) group (<30 g of carbohydrates/day, 43% protein, and 44% fat). Both diets provided approximately 1,200 kcal/day, and both groups were given equivalent doses of tirzepatide for weight loss throughout the trial. Results showed that participants experienced significant weight reduction, which was comparable between the two groups. However, when total weight loss was broken down between fat mass and lean mass losses, it became apparent that, compared to the LCD group, the LEKT group had lost significantly more fat (−13.4±2.8% for the LEKT group vs. −10.2±3.1% for the LCD group; P=0.042) and significantly less lean mass (−4.29±1.31% vs. −0.50±0.82%, P=0.039). Accordingly, resting metabolic rate — which is heavily influenced by body composition — was found to have decreased relative to baseline among those on a low-calorie diet (−5.3±1.8%, P<0.001) but not among those on a ketogenic diet. While this study was not randomized (group allocation depended on participants’ willingness to adhere to the respective diets), it provides intriguing preliminary data on the potential benefit of a ketogenic diet for those on GLP-1 RAs. doi: 10.3390/nu17071216 A combination of rapamycin and trametinib has additive lifespan effects Why we are interested: Having an exogenous molecule that can extend lifespan is an attractive idea, and we have discussed a range of these possible “anti-aging” drugs, or geroprotectors (e.g., rapamycin, NAD+, metformin). Of these, rapamycin has been extensively studied and shown to extend lifespan across various species. But what if these lifespan-extending effects could be pushed even further? What they showed: Rapamycin acts on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) to inhibit the activation of mTOR and extend lifespan. A parallel pathway, involving Ras proteins, has extensive crosstalk with the mTOR pathway. Thus, a combination of treatments that inhibit multiple targets in these pathways may prevent compensatory responses. In this study, researchers Gkioni et al. studied the lifespan-extending effects of trametinib — a small-molecule inhibitor of Ras — alone and in combination with rapamycin in male and female mice.3 They found trametinib alone extended female and male median lifespan by 7.2% and 10.2%, respectively, while rapamycin alone increased median lifespan 17.4% and 16.6% in female and male mice, respectively. Most interestingly, the lifespan extension of trametinib combined with rapamycin was additive — female mice lived 29% longer and male mice 27% longer. While future research will need to confirm these results, we will be interested in keeping up with the research on the combination of these two FDA-approved drugs. doi: 10.1038/s43587-025-00876-4 Transcranial stimulation for fibromyalgia treatment Why we are interested: Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that is associated primarily with widespread musculoskeletal pain, but also fatigue, sleep issues, and cognitive difficulties. There is currently no cure for fibromyalgia, so the 2.0–5.8% of the population suffering from the condition must rely on symptom management, but only 10–15% achieve pain reduction of more than 50% with current pharmacological interventions. As such, better pain management options are needed. What they showed: While the exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, it is thought to primarily affect the central nervous system, which can be modulated with the non-pharmacological intervention of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). TDCS impacts neuronal excitability and has been effective in reducing fibromyalgia pain in clinical settings. Researchers Caumo et al. demonstrate that this effectiveness extends to an at-home treatment paradigm that includes tDCS, exercise guidance, pain neuroscience education, and motivational interviews.4 Improvement of at least 50% in patient pain scores was achieved in 62.5% of participants receiving tDCS, compared to 37.5% in participants receiving sham tDCS. These findings demonstrate that a comprehensive, home-based pain management approach can lead to substantial symptom relief. Furthermore, incorporating tDCS contributes additional clinical benefits. Providing effective treatment options that can be administered at home not only alleviates symptoms but may also enhance accessibility by minimizing common obstacles to care, such as the burden of travel. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14262 For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama References Ungvari Z, Fekete M, Varga P, et al.

Show Notes Tanuj’s and Suzan’s training and expertise, and the evolving field of aesthetic medicine [4:00] This is a topic that Peter gets asked a lot about and one that he knows even less than the general public about It’s super helpful to have not one but two experts on this topic because they each have a different specialty Tell us a little bit about your training, your background, and what you focus on Dr. Tanuj Nakra Tanuj’s core specialty is oculofacial plastic surgery He trained mostly at UCLA in eye surgery and in facial surgery His original background is ophthalmology Then he did fellowships in ophthalmic plastic surgery and another fellowship in facial cosmetic surgery His practice is limited to eye and face plastic surgery That ranges from reconstruction of children, cancer reconstruction for elderly, and all the cosmetic surgeries that we can perform on the face This includes the nose and neck Tanuj moved to Austin 16 years ago after training at UCLA and joined a large group here [TOC Eye and Face], and he is also faculty of the Dell Medical School He is actively involved with academics, teaching, and residents The practice has two fellowship programs “It’s a real pleasure to be involved in academics because it’s the cutting edge of science, and we like to perform clinical research and in the academic community (which is how I know Suzan) there’s a lot of collaboration amongst specialties, and we have an opportunity to dialogue and further the specialty that we care so much about.”‒ Tanuj Nakra Dr. Suzan Obagi Suzan is a dermatologist by training, she did a fellowship in cosmetic surgery She is in academic medicine at the University of Pittsburgh She’s been there about 24 years ‒ she’s gotten to see the evolution of this entire field They used to do surgeries and a few collagen injections Now they have a plethora of tools at their disposal She trains residents, medical students, and visiting physicians from all over the world She loves the multi-specialty collaboration Both guests belong to the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, and they have a different approach from different specialists, sometimes even on the same procedure Suzan’s practice focuses on everything with regards to skin rejuvenation, peels, lasers She does a lot of fat grafting She does body liposuction, mini face lifts, eye lifts “Everything when it comes to the face is about really enhancing the appearance of the skin first, because my feeling is that’s the most important thing that everyone sees.”‒ Suzan Obagi When a patient comes in who has not had anything done or doesn’t know about the field, Suzan actually likes that because she can take that opportunity to really educate them and pick the right things for them Peter jokes, “I appreciate you noticing I’ve had nothing done.” Before the podcast, they were discussing the strategy Peter has taken towards his appearance There is something about this field of medicine that Peter has such a block in his brain to understanding He has met Tanuj before: Tanuj helped him with a scar Peter’s friend Brett Kotlus [guest on episode #13] introduced them Peter face planted one morning due to some hypotension and sustained a pretty nice scar that for the most part is largely invisible today (probably in part because his face is leather to begin with) In part that’s because he did some 5-FU microabrasion along with a whole bunch of stuff, and Peter was actually pretty diligent about staying out of the sun for the period of time afterwards He’s also done a Botox treatment, which certainly reduced the wrinkles (obviously it’s long gone) Peter has taken a strategy towards his appearance that is probably illogical: he ignores it because he doesn’t understand it He focuses on things he understands Peter adds, “I would view it as an enormous win of this podcast if in a few hours, I decided to do something that was sustainable and going to help me look a little better at 62 than I should look. (I’m 52 today).” Peter looked at a picture of himself 10 years ago before this podcast, and what a difference 10 years has made He looks so much worse today That’s probably not uncommon and would guess that 42 to 52 is a big reduction in appearance It made him realize that the reduction in the next 10 years will be greater if he doesn’t do something proactive Peter admits, “I can’t even bring myself to wash my face before bed.” Which his wife finds disgusting Tanuj and Suzan have their work cut out for them because if Peter can be educated on this, they can change the world The biology of the aging face [10:45] We’re going to limit our discussion to the neck up Why did Peter look better at 42 than 52? That’s exactly how Suzan’s patients come in; they say, “I feel like I look tired. I don’t know exactly what’s going on…” She uses diagrams of the face of someone who’s 20 and someone who’s in their late 60s to explain the changes If you look at a diagram of the face with the skin peeled off, you’ll see about 11 different fat compartments in the youthful face [shown in the figure below] On each side of the face that are plump, they’re robust, they’re giving volume, and they’re giving a padding between the skin and the muscle and the underlying bones Figure 1. Superficial fat compartments of the face. Image credit: MAIPS Then you look at someone who’s in their late 60s, and you peel the skin away, and you see a dramatic atrophy in all those fat pads A few might increase in size, but the vast majority undergo atrophy {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Thinking critically about a new study on AI and cognition",
      "content": "The last few years have seen an astronomical rise in the power and capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) — and with it, the mainstream use of AI for creating everything from memes and cartoons to software code and academic papers has likewise skyrocketed. There’s no question that deep learning and generative AI hold enormous promise for improving many aspects of daily life and even health (for some specifics, check out my interview with Dr. Isaac Kohane, an expert in AI and medicine), but concerns are also growing around the potential “dark sides” of AI use. Many of these concerns have thus far focused on ethical dilemmas, such as privacy considerations, socioeconomic disparities, and job displacement. But last week, new results from a study out of MIT sent a different fear into the spotlight: could the use of AI be bad for our brains?1 The study has been publicized across popular press and social media, spreading alarm with headlines suggesting that the use of AI leads to cognitive deficits and a reduced ability to learn and think. But as we’ve seen so many times in the past, important nuance tends to get lost in the midst of media frenzies, and alarm spreads faster than truth. So what did the study really show? And how should it impact how we utilize AI tools going forward? What they did The MIT study sought to investigate the effect of using AI versus a search engine or the human brain alone for a series of essay-writing tasks on neural activity and cognitive engagement. A total of 54 participants (18–39 years of age) were tasked with writing three SAT essays, for which they were randomly divided into three groups: 1) a ChatGPT group, in which participants were restricted to using OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o as a resource; 2) a search engine group, in which participants were prohibited from using any large language model (LLM) AI bots but were permitted use of any other internet resource; and 3) a brain-only group, in which participants had to rely exclusively on their own brains. Participants remained in the same group for all three writing sessions, which were conducted roughly at one-month intervals and each lasted 20 minutes. The investigators then had participants complete a fourth essay-writing task based on the previous three. However, for this fourth essay, the groups were switched: the ChatGPT group was no longer allowed to use any outside resources, while the brain-only group was allowed to use ChatGPT. (No search engine group was included in the fourth writing session.) During all four sessions, the researchers monitored participants’ brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG), and following completion of the essay, participants were interviewed about the experience. Essays were also analyzed by human teachers and a specialized AI tool. What they found Results showed a clear pattern: as use of external resources increased, participants’ cognitive engagement decreased. The authors reported that those in the ChatGPT group exhibited the weakest neural connectivity, particularly with respect to semantic processing, creativity, memory, and executive engagement, and activity in these areas decreased over the three sessions. By contrast, connectivity in the brain-only group was the strongest, most extensive, and increased with successive writing sessions. These results mirrored findings from post-writing interviews, in which participants in the ChatGPT group reported a low sense of ownership over the work compared to the brain-only and search engine groups. Essay analysis showed that use of ChatGPT resulted in more homogeneous essays across participants than was observed in essays from the other groups, though other aspects of essay scoring did not appear to differ systematically across groups. When participants switched groups for the fourth writing task, the ChatGPT→brain group exhibited significant performance deficits compared to the brain→ChatGPT group. While the brain→ChatGPT group demonstrated strong memory of previous prompts and essays, the ChatGPT→brain group underperformed in this capacity. Participants in the ChatGPT→brain group displayed greater neural connectivity in the fourth session than in the previous three, but it did not reach the peak levels observed in the brain-only group for sessions 2-3. Session 4 connectivity among the brain→ChatGPT group, on the other hand, exceeded the level of the ChatGPT group across any of the first three sessions. In other words, these results showed that the use of LLMs for essay writing leads to progressive reduction in neural connectivity and poor engagement. Even after a subsequent switch to using their own brains, those who had previously relied on ChatGPT failed to “catch up” to the levels of cognitive engagement achieved by those who had relied on their brains more regularly. The authors interpreted these findings as evidence that reliance on AI tools leads to “the accumulation of cognitive debt,” characterized by reduced critical thinking and creativity. What it does — and doesn’t — mean for cognition The news raced through social media and news outlets: AI is rotting our brains. But is that interpretation really justified? Hardly. This study — which notably has not yet undergone the peer-review process — was designed to evaluate the effect of AI on cognitive engagement, but it was not designed to evaluate effects on the capacity for cognitive engagement. In other words, it may have shown that the use of LLMs reduced the amount of thinking that was required for completion of the essay tasks, but it did not show that the use of LLMs impaired participants’ ability to think. The availability of AI as a resource meant that the ChatGPT group didn’t need to rely so heavily on their own power of thinking in order to complete the essay, and neural activity in this group diminished even further with repeated sessions not because they were getting dumber, but the exact opposite: analysis of their ChatGPT use showed that they were getting progressively smarter in how to use AI most effectively and efficiently, thus further reducing the amount of “brain power” that was required for each successive essay. So what can we make of the poor performance of the ChatGPT→brain group on the fourth essay? Critically, this essay (which was completed by only 18 participants in total) was based on the previous three. The ChatGPT→brain group was thus at a distinct disadvantage, as their reduced engagement in the first three essays would naturally lead to worse memory of the material. These results are hardly surprising — they’re analogous to showing that copying someone else’s homework all semester is less effective as a means of learning than completing the work yourself. To properly assess whether the repeated use of AI bots truly compromised cognitive abilities, the researchers would have needed to assess the ChatGPT→brain group’s performance on an entirely new assignment. Questioning “neural connectivity” results At this point, you may be asking how the study’s EEG data fit into these conclusions, as a reduction in neural connectivity among those using ChatGPT would certainly suggest long-lasting, negative changes in cognitive capacity. Indeed, the EEG results were perhaps the greatest source of misunderstanding and alarm over this research, as the very term “neural connectivity” is misleading in this context. EEG measures neural activity, but it cannot directly assess neural connections. It can be used to infer connectivity by demonstrating coordinated patterns of neural activity across different brain regions,2 but critically, the absence of activity does not mean that the connections don’t exist or have been lost — they just aren’t observable because they aren’t actively engaged. (As an analogy, we can imagine flipping on a light switch. If we flip the switch and a particular light goes on in the room, we can infer that the light is connected to the switch, even if we can’t see the wiring directly. But if no one flips the switch, it doesn’t mean that there is no connection between the switch and a light — we simply have no information that can confirm or refute any potential connections.) So although the EEG results from this study indicate that participants engaged neural circuits related to critical thinking, memory, and creativity less extensively when writing essays with AI assistance than they did when writing on their own, we cannot interpret these results as indicating that such circuits were in any way impaired or degenerating. They simply weren’t “switched on.” Of note, had ChatGPT truly caused losses in neural connectivity, it presumably might have shown up in session 4 (i.e., the ChatGPT→brain group’s first experience using only their brains) as a level of activation below that seen in session 1 of the brain-only group. This, however, was not the case. The ChatGPT→brain group exhibited greater neural activation in their first unassisted writing task than the brain-only group. A supplement rather than a replacement So does this mean that we can ignore this study entirely and outsource all of our thinking onto AI bots without fear of negative consequences for cognition? Not quite. The brain, like muscle, is something of a “use it or lose it” organ. The more we engage certain circuits, the stronger they become, whereas inactive circuits tend to weaken over time. While this particular study provides no evidence that repeated reliance on AI can result in reduced capacity for critical thinking or creativity, such an effect is certainly plausible — or even probable — if we never “practice” these cognitive skills ourselves and truly offload all such tasks onto AI tools. The risks are likely highest among children and adolescents, as the brain is especially malleable during these periods of development. Thus, we should approach these tools as a supplement to our own mental abilities rather than as a replacement for them. In the classroom, this will likely require updates to existing methods for teaching and evaluation that embrace the use of AI while still requiring active engagement by the student — just as the dawn of the internet shifted educational emphasis from fact-finding and memorization to information analysis and synthesis. Indeed, AI can facilitate greater cognitive engagement when used judiciously. To use writing as an example, AI assistance in grammar oversight and essay organization can free up time to devote more attention to crafting the strongest argument. The key to striking the right balance will be to assess which tasks truly demand deep thinking and ensure that, in such situations, we use these tools to inform our own thought process rather than relinquishing ownership to AI. Putting it all together Despite the alarm, this study certainly does not show that the use of AI is rotting your brain or impairing critical thinking skills. (Ironically, the writers responsible for the panicked headlines appear to have failed to apply critical thinking in their own evaluation of this research.) Rest assured, you do not need to cancel your AI subscriptions in an effort to preserve your cognitive health. The study does, however, demonstrate that the use of ChatGPT or other such tools have the potential to reduce engagement while completing cognitively demanding tasks. Though not shown by this work, such a tendency might eventually contribute to erosion of cognitive abilities, but only if we rely on these tools as a complete replacement for — rather than a supplement to — our own brains. As long as we keep ourselves in the driver’s seat, AI can just as easily serve to strengthen and expand our capacity for deep and creative thinking, and the combined force of human intelligence and artificial intelligence can yield advancements we have yet to imagine.

      "content": "B.J. Miller, a hospice and palliative care physician, and Bridget Sumser, a licensed social worker specializing in serious illness and end-of-life care, join Peter to share insights from their decades of work supporting people at the end of life. In this episode, they explore the emotional and physiological processes of dying, the cultural barriers that prevent meaningful conversations about death, and how early engagement with mortality can lead to greater clarity and connection. The conversation highlights the distinctions between hospice and palliative care, the nature of suffering beyond physical pain, and the transformative role of honesty, forgiveness, and relational awareness in the dying process. Through stories and reflections, B.J. and Bridget reveal what truly matters in the end—and how the dying can teach the living not only how to face death but how to live more fully.

Show Notes The personal journeys of BJ and Bridget into end-of-life care, and the connection between living and dying [3:30] BJ was a previous guest on the podcast he spoke a little bit about some of the topics we’re going to get to today [episode #135] When Peter reached out to him a few months ago to talk about this podcast, he immediately suggested bringing Bridget along Peter wanted to understand more about living and thought we could learn a lot from people who are dying People who listen to this podcast know that Peter thinks the quality of life matters as much, and potentially more than the length of life A big part of that comes down to things people think about during their life and during the end of their life Maybe there are regrets that people have that only surface at the end of life Why is this a great three person discussion as opposed to a two person? BJ loves the setup for this conversation It’s not quality of life versus quantity of life (kind of false dichotomy) BJ has worked with Bridget in a myriad of ways over the years They are going to thwart the idea that there’s an objective, an approach to death that is the way to go They’re not going to cite much data, it’s not an easily studied phase of life What data exist tends to be qualitative With all that subjectivity, it feels really important to have other voices sharing their point of view of a similar outlook (thats in part why he wanted to include Bridget) BJ’s work in the last four years has pulled him farther away from being at a bedside Both BJ and Bridget have spent many countless hours in hospital bedsides and other places that they’ll be drawing from To get to the questions that Peter is interested in answering, so much of the work preparing for dying begins earlier in life (one way in another) For the audience to imagine deathbed scenes that in the final moments there’s this great epiphany or climax ‒ that can happen, but that’s really not the norm A lot of the action is in the days, weeks, months, years preceding the death moment Death is a moment One thing they want to get across is we need to bring dying and living together They are part of a whole, they’re not at odds And so when do we begin dying? The second we are born So in some ways, all of us have some access to this subject already Bridget and BJ are just a little bit closer to it on some level Bridget, what drew you to this space? It is an uncomfortable place to stand, what’s drawn you to it? We all have our places in the world, and while this is an uncomfortable place maybe from the outside, for Bridget, it is a pretty comfortable place, and that was what got her there She had many people in her life die She was in pretty close proximity to those deaths and she wasn’t freaking out She looked around and a lot of other people were freaking out, and she was sort of like, “Oh, this is weird. Am I unaffected? Am I guarded in a way that makes it some kind of numb?” No Actually it was more just that there was something in her that was okay around dying and also really curious about it That’s how she got to this work What were some of the experiences you had growing up? Bridget’s cousin Kristen died when she was 13 and Bridget was 18 She had pulmonary primary hypertension Bridget was with her the day she died As you can imagine, a 13-year-old dying is a pretty chaotic scene She was not in an official dying process that anyone was recognizing It was crisis-y and traumatic and there was just a stillness in Bridget Bridget was very affected, there was a lot of emotion She felt fear and overwhelm, but she also felt really able to be there Bridget was 18 and the adults around her were all over the place It was less about others, although she felt quite connected to Kristen Bridget shares, “It was more about being able to stay in my own body and be in my own experience and pay attention to what was happening, make contact with what was happening.” It was a pretty internal experience and awareness It wasn’t until later experiences with one of her best friend’s moms a few years later that Bridget felt that capacity in relationship to others as a main supporter That first imprint was really like, there’s something in this experience for Bridget People who listened to the earlier episode with BJ will be familiar with his story For those who aren’t, can you give the super “Reader’s Digest version” of your story and how it probably shaped a lot of what you do today? For sure it did BJ went into medicine very simply because he had been a patient At age 19, a sophomore in college, around the time Bridget was having her experience at the bedside one way or another, he was in the bed thanks to an electrical injury at Princeton He was screwing around on a commuter train and climbed up on top He had a metal watch on his left wrist and the electricity arced to the watch That was that, and he became very close to death You could say part of his body died He lost both legs and one arm (part of them) That was a really big wake-up call Peter points out the magnitude of the burns BJ sustained, the skin grafts that required How long were you in the hospital? BJ was in the burn unit for about 3 months Burn units are horrible ‒ these are houses of pain of a certain kind He was on the edge for about 3 months Peter asks, “Did you lose kidney function?” BJ doesn’t recall He remembers looking over at the monitors many weeks in and his heart rate was 190 and just sitting there There’s a lot of fallout from an injury like that, and it takes a long time for the body to settle in and declare what’s going to live and what’s not The amputations were sequential They take a little bit, see what tissue’s viable All the while the risk of infection… The way generally people die from burns is infection Because you lose immediate defenses through your line of defense of your skin So [you live in] a hyper sterile environment, no windows, nothing natural about it at all It was a long time until he was “out of the woods,” and it was clear he was going to survive Then becomes this longer work of learning to cope with this new body It entailed a lot of mourning, a lot of grief, a lot of effort, a lot of creativity on his behalf, as well as a lot of people around him It took many, many months to get out of that setting from the burn unit, into a step-down unit, then into a rehab unit, and then outpatient Then begins the work of re-entering the world That’s its own challenge with a visible disability BJ used to be so ashamed of the skin grafts; he used to cover it up There was the work of getting used to it and being comfortable in his own skin, literally, again That took about 2 years before he was willing to show anybody this After 5 years, he hit another milestone: inhabiting his own life again on some level Being anything other than an object to glare at It’s a very slow process and it’s ongoing BJ recently had a procedure that’s a fallout from a central line that was being placed in his neck that got botched and clotted off (35 years ago) He gets new legs every 2 years or so, and that’s its own process What dying looks like: the physical, cognitive, and emotional realities at the end of life [13:15] A moment ago, BJ alluded to the idea that movie deathbed scenes are probably the exception and not the rule Peter wants to explore this idea a little bit more He also wants to help people understand at the population level, what death really looks like On this podcast we talk a lot about causes of death The 4 horsemen We know about cardiovascular disease, and we know about cancer, and we know about neurodegenerative disease, and we can talk forever about these things But we don’t really talk about the very, very end, perhaps with the exception of a fatal myocardial infarction About 50% of MIs are fatal But about 50% are not, and they’re just setting you up for maybe heart failure or something else {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Inflammatory molecule found in the blood may underlie the link between diabetes and dementia",
      "content": "One of the great dangers with diabetes is the substantial increase in risk of other chronic diseases, such as dementia. Individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes face significantly higher risks of cognitive impairment compared to the general population, and this suggests there may be shared biological mechanisms at work. (Alzheimer’s disease has even gained the nickname “type 3 diabetes.”) Diabetes is well known to cause vascular complications in the heart, kidney, and eye, yet effects on the brain’s microvascular network — comprising over 95% of vessel length density2 — has received limited research attention despite its critical role in cognitive function. The brain’s heavy dependence on continuous oxygen and nutrient delivery makes it particularly vulnerable to vascular disruptions, and indeed, studies on Alzheimer’s disease have shown that small capillaries in the brain experience stalled blood flow more frequently and for longer durations compared to healthy brains.1 Could the association between diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease stem from the diabetes-attributable vascular complications in the brain? A recent study published in Nature Metabolism addressed this question, examining what happens to these tiny vessels in the brains of a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. The findings point to a somewhat surprising role for a well-known immune molecule — and a potential new avenue for intervention.3 A direct look at brain blood flow in living mice The researchers began with a straightforward question: do the brains of diabetic mice experience more microscopic “traffic jams” in their vasculature than healthy brains? Using advanced microscopy techniques, the investigators directly examined blood flow in diabetic mice versus healthy controls. Diabetes was induced by treatment with streptozotocin, a drug that selectively destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, creating a condition that closely resembles human type 1 diabetes. Diabetic mice showed a 2-4x increase in brain capillary stalling compared to controls, with 1.82–3.64% of capillaries blocked at any given time versus 0.47–0.93% in normal brains. In other words, the diabetic mice were receiving less blood flow to their brains than healthy controls. The majority of the clogs were primarily formed by red blood cells, which were typically getting stuck in medium-sized venules (second- to fourth-order branches), whereas only 25-32% of blockages in the diabetic mice involved white blood cells. Because diabetes-associated vascular damage is thought to arise in large part from the toxic effects of hyperglycemia and resulting inflammation, the authors sought to assess the role of aberrant glycemic control in contributing to these stalls by treating mice with insulin to lower blood sugar levels. Though insulin treatment lowered blood glucose in diabetic mice to nearly the level of control mice, the obstruction rates remained elevated, showing only a slight reduction from the degree of obstruction observed in animals with uncontrolled diabetes. This suggests that high blood sugar could not completely account for the vascular problems in diabetic mice — something else was playing a role. Identifying an unexpected cause To investigate what else could be causing red blood cells to get stuck in diabetic brains, the research team took a closer look at potential mechanisms related to inflammation. They adopted a systematic approach, screening serum from diabetic mice for 29 different inflammatory molecules, searching for potential drivers of vascular dysfunction. To avoid being fooled by potential inflammatory artifacts caused by streptozotocin treatment itself, the researchers performed blood screens in two separate mouse models of diabetes: mice treated with streptozotocin to chemically induce diabetes, and a genetic model that spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes. While many inflammatory molecules were elevated in diabetic blood, only one — interleukin-10 (IL-10) — remained consistently high at both time points tested (4 weeks and 8 weeks after diabetes onset). The results were surprising, as IL-10 has an established reputation as an anti-inflammatory mediator that typically protects against tissue damage in conditions like infection and stroke. Yet IL-10 is what is known as a “pleiotropic” cytokine, meaning it can have multiple effects depending on the biological context, potentially acting in a protective manner in one setting and a harmful manner in another. Indeed, when the authors injected IL-10 into healthy mice, they found significant increases in vessel blockages, confirming that elevated IL-10 directly contributes to vascular problems rather than protecting against them. Testing IL-10 blockade as a therapeutic strategy Of course, merely identifying a culprit is only laying the groundwork for what really matters: can this mechanism be targeted therapeutically to reduce vessel blockages and improve cognitive trajectories? As a first step in addressing this question, the investigators utilized an immunotherapeutic approach involving antibodies to block the IL-10 receptor, thus blocking the effects of IL-10. This treatment decreased stalled capillaries by 63%, downregulated pathways involved in cell adhesion (which likely contributes to blood cell stalling), and expanded capillary diameter by 25% in branches near arterioles, potentially helping clear existing blockages and prevent new ones from forming. These results demonstrate that blocking IL-10 may be a viable treatment strategy for mitigating blood flow disruptions in diabetic brains. These vascular improvements were also found to translate to better cognitive function. Diabetic mice treated with IL-10 receptor antibodies showed improvements in learning and memory tasks relative to untreated mice, performing comparably to non-diabetic controls on a series of tests related to cognition and sensorimotor skills. Key questions for clinical translation Before we get too excited about these findings, it’s important to reiterate that these tests were merely a first step. As we detailed in a recent newsletter, significant hurdles always exist between preclinical research and viable human therapies, and in the case of the present work, certain specific concerns are worth noting. There’s the obvious limitation that this work was done in mouse models that don’t perfectly mirror human diabetes and brain microvasculature. Most diabetic mice in this study were chemically treated with streptozotocin to completely destroy pancreatic beta cells, which itself might contribute to systemic inflammation, and the genetic diabetes model that they used is known to exhibit various defects in immune function (some of which are responsible for their development of diabetes). It’s unclear whether the results would therefore translate to a natural, human context of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Additionally, the study used injected microspheres to assess blood vessel blockages, a useful research tool that may not perfectly replicate how actual blood cells behave in human diabetic brains. Perhaps more concerning is the safety question around blocking IL-10 in humans. IL-10 plays crucial immune regulatory roles throughout the body — recall that as a pleiotropic cytokine, it also serves the purpose of protecting against excessive inflammation and autoimmune reactions. Systemically blocking this molecule could potentially leave patients vulnerable to infections or inflammatory conditions. While the researchers didn’t report any obvious signs of infection or immune problems in the mice that received IL-10-blocking treatments, the study was relatively short and focused primarily on vascular and cognitive outcomes rather than comprehensive immune function. Mice used in research are also largely protected from pathogens in laboratory settings, so what’s safe for temporary use in a controlled laboratory may not translate to long-term human use in an open environment. Still, the researchers were able to show that blocking IL-10 was effective in reducing vessel blockages and improving cognition, and two methodological details lend a little extra promise with respect to potential translation to human therapies. First, the treatment in this study was performed with an antibody rather than genetic manipulation, and second, the antibody was applied systemically (via intravenous injection) rather than requiring specific injection into the brain or cerebrospinal fluid to exert its effects. In other words, it’s possible to target this pathway with non-invasive pharmacological interventions, though developing more focal approaches may be necessary to avoid off-target effects. The bottom line This research reveals that brain complications in type 1 diabetes may stem from an unexpected source — an often anti-inflammatory immune molecule causing microscopic traffic jams that impair cognition in mice. The findings suggest that current diabetes management, focused primarily on blood sugar control, may be missing an important piece of the puzzle, though this remains to be proven in humans. The discovery reminds us of the complex nature of the immune system in chronic diseases, highlighting how the same immune signals can be protective in one context and harmful in another. While IL-10’s essential immune roles make systemic blockade potentially risky, if these findings hold up in human studies, they could point toward new therapeutic approaches that complement current diabetes care. For now, the established principles of diabetes management remain unchanged, but this work unveils a potential critical link underlying the long-recognized association between diabetes and cognitive decline — and opens intriguing possibilities for the future.

Show Notes Why the topic of fasting is being revisited [1:45] The topic of Fasting: First time fasting was covered in AMA #11, released January 2020. This episode is AMA #72, highlighting how long it’s been since they fully addressed the topic. Rationale for Revisit Fasting is a highly requested and frequently misunderstood topic. Though touched on in various episodes since AMA #11, this is the first full dedicated revisit. Peter’s thinking has evolved since then, including patient application and personal practice. Episode Structure Preview Clarifying Terminology Acknowledgment that confusion arises from inconsistent definitions (e.g., “fasting” means different things to different people). First goal of the episode: define terms and types of fasting protocols. Main Content Themes Reasons people choose to fast and the purported or actual benefits. Topic areas include: Body composition Metabolic health Lifespan / longevity Cardiovascular disease Cancer (prevention and treatment) Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s) Autoimmune conditions (e.g., arthritis) Risks and Downsides Will explore potential negative effects of fasting and who should be cautious. Practical Application The episode will close with a framework to: Help listeners decide how (or if) to use fasting. Show how Peter uses fasting personally and with his patients. The importance of being open to changing one’s opinion in science and medicine as new evidence emerges [4:15] Why Changing Opinions Matters Peter is known for changing his mind when new evidence emerges. References the “Strong Convictions, Loosely Held” theme used in milestone episodes like #200 and #300. This episode focuses on fasting, a topic where Peter’s views have evolved over time based on new data and clinical experience. Many public figures—and people in general—become overly attached to their initial beliefs and resist change. When someone changes their mind publicly, people often criticize them by saying, “How could you say this if you used to say that?” Peter’s Response: A Framework for Intellectual Flexibility Everyone—not just scientists or doctors—should be open to changing opinions in light of new information. In today’s world, especially in politics, changing your mind is often seen as a weakness. The more firmly someone sticks to their opinion, the more credible they appear. Changing your mind should be seen as a strength, not a flaw. Science is inherently probabilistic, not absolute. Even facts that feel like certainties (e.g., gravity) are grounded in probabilities. Medicine and science evolve constantly. No belief should be held with rigid certainty. Examples of Changing Positions Peter received backlash for changing his position on GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic, Wegovy). See episodes #184, 246, 279, 320 He quotes economist John Maynard Keynes: “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” Guiding Principle Peter is not wed to being right—he is wed to knowing what is right. He recommends that others adopt the same orientation: focus on truth and growth, not ego or consistency. Constant evolution of understanding is the best way to stay aligned with reality. Defining fasting and how it fits in the framework of dietary restriction, time-restricted feeding, and calorie restriction [7:30] Establishing a Foundational Nutrition Framework Energy balance is essential: consuming too much or too little is harmful. Adequate protein intake is a constant requirement for maintaining lean mass. The ratio of carbohydrates to fats is less important as long as total energy intake is appropriate. Sufficient micronutrient intake and avoiding toxins are also fundamental. For over 80% of people (based on Peter’s clinical experience), maintaining energy balance requires effort and strategy. Peter’s DR/TR/CR Framework DR (Dietary Restriction): Deliberately restricts a specific dietary element. Can involve limiting carbs, fats, animal products, or processed foods. No single best method—many forms can work if the restriction is significant enough. TR (Time restriction): Limits the eating window each day without necessarily changing food quality or quantity. Also referred to as intermittent fasting. Narrowing the eating window often naturally reduces caloric intake. CR (Caloric Restriction): Focuses on reducing total calories consumed, regardless of the type or timing of food. May not involve food type or timing changes—just smaller portions. These strategies can be combined. Example: During peak cycling performance, Peter used both DR and TR, eating one snack and one meal daily, with significant dietary constraints, resulting in being 16–17 pounds lighter than his current weight. Clarifying the Term “Fasting” “Fasting” lacks a standardized definition and is used broadly. It can describe: Complete water-only fasting for multiple days. Daily time-restricted feeding (e.g., 16:8 or 18:6 fasting windows). The discussion in the episode will further explore various fasting protocols, their definitions, and their pros and cons. The most common types of fasting [11:45] In this figure, you can see what an ADF protocol might look like—the pink squares on this over the course of a seven-day week show you days of either complete or significant caloric restriction: {end of show notes preview}",

      "title": "More laypeople are prepared to intervene during opioid overdoses, but misconceptions persist",
      "content": "The opioid crisis is no longer breaking news – it’s a well-known reality. And with it, naloxone (trade name: Narcan) has become a part of the public lexicon as a life-saving medication that can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose. Public health messaging has increasingly urged laypeople (not just clinicians or first responders) to carry naloxone or keep it at home. But is this message actually getting through? A recent study by Gage et al. sheds light on that question, offering a data-driven look at whether this advice is translating into action.1 Are more people keeping naloxone on hand? And are they willing to use it if faced with a potential overdose? And if not, then why? How does naloxone work? Opioids mediate their effects by binding and activating mu-opioid receptors in the brain. These effects include slowed breathing, and in the case of an overdose, respiratory drive can stop altogether. This, of course, will quickly result in death — unless it can be rapidly reversed. Naloxone is a competitive antagonist at the mu-opioid receptor, meaning that it binds to the same receptors as opioids themselves — and does so with greater affinity — but doesn’t activate the receptors upon binding. This allows it to displace opioid molecules already bound to the receptor and block any further opioid activity. Sufficient doses of naloxone can therefore restore respiration in someone who has overdosed on opioids, often within two to three minutes — fast enough to make the difference between life and death. The most accessible form of naloxone today is a nasal spray. It doesn’t require needles and is simple to use, even without prior training. In many areas, it’s available for free through various community programs, libraries, and pharmacies. This accessibility is no accident; it’s a part of a broader effort to decentralize emergency response and put life-saving tools in the hands of as many people as possible. The more individuals equipped with naloxone, the greater our collective capacity to respond to overdose events, even before professional help arrives. But only if laypeople are willing to use it. About the study Gage et al. carried out a retrospective cross-sectional study analyzing national Emergency Medical Service (EMS) data to evaluate the trends in layperson-administered naloxone (LAN) from June 2020 to June 2022. Using over 65 million EMS 911 activations from the National Emergency Medical Services Information System, the study identified 744,078 instances in which naloxone was administered, 24,990 (3.4%) of which were given by laypersons before EMS arrival. While the overall rate of naloxone administration by EMS decreased by 6.1% over the study period (from 1140.1 to 1070.1 per 100,000 EMS activations), naloxone administration by laypeople increased by a staggering 43.5% over the study period, from 30.0 administrations per 100,000 EMS activations in 2020 (95% CI: 29.2–30.8) to 43.1 in 2022 (95% CI: 42.0–44.1). A joinpoint regression revealed a notable inflection point in LAN rates between October 2020 and March 2021, with a significant monthly percentage increase of 7.96% (95% CI: 2.22%–16.92%; P =0.04). The overall average monthly percentage increase in LAN was 1.13% (95% CI: 0.45%–1.97%; P =0.001). These findings highlight a substantial increase in bystander involvement in overdose response, providing compelling evidence of a shifting dynamic: more laypeople are intervening during opioid overdoses, often before EMS arrives — potentially saving lives in the critical minutes that matter most. A small public health victory The increase in layperson-administered naloxone is indeed a public health victory, as it was a direct result of deliberate public health efforts aimed at expanding access, educating the public, and normalizing the idea that friends, family members, and bystanders can — and should — intervene. This shift in behavior matters. A lot. In the event of an opioid overdose (as in cardiac arrest and stroke), time is the critical variable. EMS can be fast, but they’re not instantaneous. Nationally, the median EMS response time for overdose is about 6 minutes, yet brain damage from oxygen deprivation can begin within 4 to 5 minutes. A 2020 study by Schwartz et al. remarkably reported that nearly 60% of LAN cases involved bystanders stepping in five or more minutes before EMS arrived.2 In over half of those cases, the individual recovered without needing hospital transport. It’s one of the clearest data-backed demonstrations we have of early intervention by non-professionals saving lives. However, while the study by Gage et al. shows an incredibly promising 43.5% increase in LAN over two years, a closer look at the numbers reveals a significant gap. Across the study’s 65 million EMS activations, there were 744,078 instances where naloxone was administered. Of these, only 24,990 doses, just 3.4%, were given by a layperson before EMS arrived. Given that approximately 40% of opioid overdoses are witnessed by a bystander,3 we can estimate that for around 297,631 overdose events during this period, someone was present who could have intervened. Yet laypeople intervened and utilized naloxone in only 24,990 of those cases — an action rate of just 8.4%. This means that more than 9 out of 10 witnessed overdoses did not receive immediate naloxone from a bystander (assuming all cases were such that a bystander could be present, but even without such an assumption, the gap remains wide). In other words, while the relative increase in layperson naloxone use is encouraging, the absolute numbers are sobering: if every bystander who witnessed an overdose had intervened, there could have been nearly 300,000 potential layperson-administered naloxone saves during the study window. Instead, there were fewer than 25,000. This raises an uncomfortable but necessary question: why aren’t more people prepared to act? The barriers to naloxone use – and why they don’t hold up Despite naloxone’s life-saving potential, many remain hesitant to keep it on hand or to use it when it’s needed. The hesitancy stems largely from a set of common misperceptions — barriers that, when examined more closely, simply don’t hold up. Underestimating risk One of the most pervasive misconceptions is the tendency to underestimate risk. Many still perceive opioid overdose as something that happens only to those with substance use disorders. But overdoses can also occur in the context of legitimate prescriptions — for instance during chronic pain management, post-surgical recovery, or cancer treatment. It can happen to a teenager at a party who takes a counterfeit pill without knowing that it’s laced with fentanyl. It can happen when a child accidentally finds a medication bottle at home. These scenarios aren’t rare, and they don’t follow a script. As discussed by deputy sheriff Anthony Hipolito on the podcast, they’re closer to all of us than we like to admit. Many such accidents happen in familiar places: our homes, neighborhoods, even offices. Yet even in these everyday settings, naloxone often isn’t where it needs to be, and neither is the knowledge of how to use it. Fear of inexperience Many worry they wouldn’t know what to do in an overdose situation. But today’s formulations, especially the nasal spray, are intuitive and require no prior training. Instructions are straightforward, and most people can be ready to act in a matter of minutes. Fear of doing harm Another common fear is that, by taking action, a bystander might make the situation worse. Yet clinically, naloxone is among the safest emergency interventions available. If opioids aren’t present in the patient’s system, naloxone simply has no effect. It causes no harm if given during a seizure, diabetic coma, or cardiac arrest. It has no abuse potential and doesn’t intoxicate. In emergency medicine, few interventions offer such an enormous upside with virtually no downside. That said, it’s important to remember that naloxone buys time, but it doesn’t solve the underlying emergency. Its effects last 30–90 minutes, while synthetic opioids like fentanyl can last much longer. Calling 911 immediately remains essential. Legal concerns Related to the fear of making things worse is the fear of legal repercussions. Some hesitate out of worry that stepping in could backfire or that they could be blamed. However, nearly every state now has Good Samaritan laws protecting individuals who assist in an emergency, including those who administer naloxone. These protections are written into policy in order to encourage, not discourage, life-saving action. “It’s not my place” And then there’s the social barrier, the idea that “it’s not my place.” When overdoses happen in public or unfamiliar settings, people often assume someone else will step in. Yet the “bystander effect” — i.e., the fact that individuals tend to be less likely to help others, even in an emergency, if other bystanders are also present — is real and well-documented, and in many cases, your action may be the only thing standing between someone and irreversible injury or death. Fear of Stigma Some fear that carrying naloxone will send the wrong message and that others will assume they are at risk themselves. But carrying naloxone is no more an admission of opioid use than owning a fire extinguisher is an admission of a personal tendency toward pyromania or arson. Naloxone availability signals readiness, not risk. Should you have naloxone easily accessible? Indeed, whether or not you personally use opioids is just one small piece of the risk equation. The real question is whether your environment or circumstances put you in proximity to opioid risk such that you may want to be prepared to act should the occasion arise. From a purely risk-based perspective, there are many variables to consider in deciding whether to have naloxone on hand. An obvious risk factor is if someone in your life is taking prescription opioids. Likewise, another consideration is whether you live with or care for aging adults, adolescents, or anyone else who might have unsupervised access to medications. Geography matters, too. Overdose rates vary widely by region, and local public health departments often provide detailed maps of overdose hotspots. If you live in or near one of these areas, having naloxone accessible is a rational form of risk mitigation. Occupational exposure also plays a role. If you work in healthcare, education, fitness, social work, public safety, or any setting where you regularly interact with the public, you’re statistically more likely to witness an overdose than someone who isn’t. But beyond these specific categories, there’s a broader mindset worth adopting: if you believe in being prepared for low-probability, high-consequence events (the same logic behind learning CPR or wearing a seatbelt), then having naloxone available fits within that framework. It’s a form of responsibility that’s both simple and powerful. The bottom line The rise in layperson-administered naloxone marks a real step forward, but it’s only the beginning. The data show that public health messaging is starting to land. More people are stepping in when it matters most, and early action by non-professionals can, and does, save lives. But the gap between potential and actual intervention remains vast. The barriers, including misperceptions, stigma, and inaction, are still costing lives that might otherwise be saved. Naloxone is a practical, no-harm, high-impact tool that belongs wherever there’s risk, which increasingly means just about everywhere. The case for being prepared is clear, but a challenge remains in turning awareness into readiness.

In this episode, which follows last week’s conversation on male fertility, Paula explores the biology of female fertility, including how hormonal changes regulate the menstrual cycle and ovulation, what those patterns reveal about fertility potential, and why both partners should be evaluated early in infertility workups. She discusses the role of the fallopian tubes, the causes of miscarriage, the impact of age and lifestyle on fertility, and treatment options for conditions like PCOS—including the emerging use of GLP-1 agonists. The episode also covers the evolution of IVF, advances in pre-implantation genetic testing, egg freezing, and the promise and limitations of next-generation reproductive technologies.

Show Notes The finite nature of a woman’s egg reserve, how it changes over time, and the basic process of ovulation and fertilization [3:00] The physiology in women is different from men, but no less complex, and there are some pretty unique things about it Sperm seem to be an infinite resource, men are constantly generating billions of these The opposite is true for women Women have a limited number of eggs When an embryo or fetus develops, the gonad differentiates into either a testes or an ovary The main difference is that sperm is produced throughout a man’s lifetime, whereas women are born with a finite number of eggs ⇒ The most eggs you’ll ever have is when you’re in your mom’s womb as a fetus, and by the time you’re born, there’s about 2 million or so eggs, and by the time you start menstruating, you’re down to maybe 400,000 A 5-fold reduction in the number of eggs occurs from birth to age 12-14, and most eggs in ovaries undergo a process called atresia (they die) Once a girl goes through puberty, every month (if she’s not on hormonal contraception) one of those eggs grows Actually, probably a group of eggs every month starts to grow, but then one takes over and is released from the ovary and usually finds its way into the fallopian tubes That’s the tube connecting the ovary and the uterus Normally if there’s not sperm around, the egg just reabsorbs and there’s no pregnancy; the lining of the uterus sheds, and a girl or woman has a period every month If there’s sperm around, there’s a chance that that egg might fertilize, and that fertilization usually happens in the fallopian tube Then that now zygote or embryo travels down the tube into the uterus and some of the time implants into the the lining of the uterus and establishes a pregnancy How hormones influence egg selection, and how and why chromosomal errors lead to most miscarriages [5:30] The cycle of what’s happening in a woman of prime reproductive age (age 20) and the role hormones are playing One of the things that has always fascinated Peter is the selection With males, we don’t think about that problem The selection tends to be more metabolic or stochastic The sperm that makes it isn’t really predetermined At day 0, a woman begins her menstrual cycle, and she’s about 14 days from ovulation We start to see the interplay of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), particularly FSH [The figure below shows how hormone levels change throughout the menstrual cycle] Figure 1. Hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. Image credit: OpenStax Anatomy & Physiology Figure 27.15 Walk through what’s happening in that period of time that ultimately leads to one and only one egg being the chosen one It’s a little random in women as well It’s true that the pituitary hormones (FSH and LH) are what drives growth of what we call the follicles The eggs are inside the follicles Usually a cohort of eggs start to grow The follicles start to get bigger and the cells surrounding the egg start to divide Peter asks, “What do they look like prior to all of that happening? These are cells that only have 50% of the genetic material. They’ve already undergone meiosis.” Yes, they’re arrested in meiosis, and meiosis is not completed until they ovulate (and then in some cases are fertilized) We have an arrested cell that has one of each of the mother’s chromosomes Including one X chromosome by definition (one of her two sex chromosomes) {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "The importance of lung cancer screening — even if you’ve never smoked",
      "content": "Last week, my wife and I had our annual screening tests for lung cancer. Neither of us have any history of lung disease or cancer, nor have we ever been smokers. We therefore aren’t among those for whom the American Cancer Society guidelines recommend regular screening, and insurance doesn’t cover the cost.1 So I wouldn’t be surprised if many of you are now asking the question, “why bother?” The answer, as I explained in a recent video (shared below), is grim but simple: not only is it possible to develop lung cancer with no history of smoking, it is incredibly and tragically common. <iframe width=\"790\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UXgVSgRwEpU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Lung cancer in never-smokers Lung cancer in general is by far the leading cause of cancer mortality both nationally and globally, and certainly, smoking plays an enormous role in risk — an estimated 80-90% of lung cancer cases are attributable to cigarette smoking or second-hand smoke exposure. But even if we exclude all cases of lung cancer among current or former smokers, lung cancer specifically among never-smokers would still rank about 7th or 8th (depending on the year) as a cause of cancer deaths in the US, accounting for over 20,000 deaths each year.2 Most of these cases are in women, among whom rates of lung cancer in never-smokers are roughly double those among men. (The reasons for this aren’t fully understood, but likely involve interactions between sex hormones and lung cancer, as discussed in a past newsletter.) A flaw in screening guidelines As is the case with any cancer, early detection and treatment of lung cancer greatly improve odds of survival, and the best (and usually only) way to catch it early is through screening. Indeed, the American Cancer Society recommends that current and former smokers between the ages of 50 and 80 undergo annual screening by low-dose CT scan. The test is quick, involves virtually non-existent exposure to radiation, and is capable of detecting stage I lung cancer with a sensitivity of about 88-90% and a specificity of 94-99%.3,4 Moreover, it’s typically covered by insurance for those with a history of smoking. But what about everyone else? Unfortunately, current guidelines make no screening recommendations for never-smokers, even for those with a family history of lung cancer or substantial exposure to second-hand smoke. A major reason for this is simply a lack of evidence regarding the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing screening recommendations in reducing lung cancer mortality specifically among never-smokers, as trials to date have focused almost exclusively on populations of current and former smokers.5 And the reason studies haven’t been performed in never-smokers isn’t because screening is unlikely to have any benefit, but rather that it’s not likely to have as dramatic a benefit as it would in a smoking population, since the overall risk for developing lung cancer as a never-smoker is roughly 1/20th that of smokers.6 Researchers trying to give themselves the best chance of seeing a statistically significant effect (without using prohibitively large cohorts) will opt for studying a subset of the population that is at highest risk for the outcome of interest. In other words, because smokers are more likely than your average person to develop lung cancer over a given follow-up period, using smokers as your study population will result in more cases of lung cancer and thus better chances of seeing a significant difference between groups in the benefits of screening. The trouble is, even if the impact of screening on lung cancer mortality is greater in a smoking population than in a non-smoking population, those population differences mean little for any individual person. If you develop lung cancer, regular screening tests drastically improve your odds of catching it early, and catching it early drastically improves your odds of survival. Period. Consider getting screened for lung cancer — even if you’ve never smoked Tens of thousands of never-smokers are diagnosed with lung cancer each year in the US alone. Some are lucky — they visit a doctor for a CAC scan to assess atherosclerosis or a chest CT scan to evaluate potential rib fractures after a fall or accident, and the scan picks up a lung adenocarcinoma in its early stages. (Such a serendipitous discovery occurred in our clinical practice with a woman in her 40s following a CTA for ASCVD screening.) But far more often, lung cancer in never-smokers is not diagnosed until it causes symptoms, typically in more advanced stages of the disease, and more often than not, such cases result in death. Yet we are not powerless in reducing our chances of meeting a similar fate. Low-dose CT scans are effective screening tests with virtually no risks (beyond some potential for false positives). I recommend having them annually, particularly for women. While they are not covered by insurance for most never-smokers, their out-of-pocket cost is around $100-200 — less than you probably pay annually for Netflix. It’s a small price to pay for peace of mind, let alone for potentially adding years to your life.

Show Notes The incredibly complex and hostile journey sperm must take to fertilize an egg [3:00] Explain what’s involved in conception through the lens of sperm Peter wonders how much of a challenge this is Obviously there’s an enormous evolutionary pressure for this to go as easily as possible But what is actually involved? What happens for a sperm to fuse with an egg? What are all the things that are standing in its way, so to speak? Paul explains, “Reproduction is an incredibly highly-evolved, million-year process, and remarkably conserved among mammalian species, even among land species and water species of animals.” Vaginas, cervixes, uteruses The question is, why is it so much work for a sperm to get into the vagina? And then have to go through a cervix The immune system in the uterus is very active, because there’s a hole in the woman to the abdomen, so it has to be highly protected Sperm have to go through the uterus, so there’s a 10-inch, 12-inch swim Which is equivalent to about a 20-mile swim for a human And they do that in minutes, which is crazy It’s an interesting challenge that nature has kept in place for a million years Paul really respects evolution, and it is why we’re here: to eat, sleep, reproduce Basically with ejaculation, the penis is shaped to fit into the cervix Everyone wonders, is it getting to the right spot? It’s also interesting that the semen is coagulated, and then it liquefies And that’s because there’s a lot of species of lower phyla that they have to leave as soon as they have sex, otherwise they’ll get killed (like praying mantises and black widow spiders) Ejaculates in humans are sticky ‒ Paul has no idea why, no evolutionary explanation for this A lot of men think they’re having trouble placing things Paul doesn’t worry about it because the cervix and the penis expand to form a seal Challenges sperm face and the numbers that make it 1 – Sperm have to go through a crypt (a channel), and only a few sperm make it So 100 million sperm may start out, maybe 5 million make it through the first barrier, which is the cervical barrier 2 – The vaginal fluid is acidic (pH 5) Semen is pH 7 It’s all buffered as a hostile environment, so it has to get out of there quickly As soon as the sperm liquefies (there’s sugars in there), they go through the cervical path So 5 million will make it 1 out of 20 makes it through the cervix Then 100 make it to the fallopian tube, and then 1 will make it to the egg These numbers were found by studies done in the 50s of women who had sex before hysterectomies Then different parts of the reproductive tract were swabbed These young women had hysterectomies for different reasons, not infertile This is the basis for our move to technology, from 5 million moving sperm when we start doing inseminations versus sex Those are based on the numbers of sperm that reach the uterus Everyone thought the vanguard sperm wins It’s the Phelps sperm that’s going to make it There’s a company out of Boston called Arex Life Sciences, and they’ve discovered that sperm work in phalanxes Disclosure: Paul is consulting for Arex Biosciences Because the immune system is so vibrant in the uterus, the first round of sperm gets through the cervix and typically absorbs the immune system, secretes Fc receptor Peter asks, “We’ve referred to the immune system a couple of times now… What is the barrier?” The full immune response: T cells, B cells, and antibodies There’s also a mucus plug that exists for 28 days a month to prevent anything from going through, because it’s a hole into the woman’s body, and peritonitis is severe ⇒ The cervical mucus thins, and that’s to let sperm through for 2 days a month It’s an incredibly detailed, perfectly-orchestrated system It looks like the first round of sperm get through the cervix, get into the uterus, and they get demolished like a Roman phalanx Maybe a second round goes through and they get demolished They’re secreting the FCR receptor on the immunoglobulin, because that’s what female antibodies bind to We don’t know how many phalanxes go through, but then it’s like a run up the middle, and then eventually a couple of sperm make it, and the immune system is deactivated and they get there (it’s wild) That can be measured now, and there’s actually going to be an assay available to look at whether you’re doing this They’re calling it a sperm cycle Almost like ovulation, spermulation It’s an hour and a half cycle when the phalanx is working, sperm are deactivating the immune system, and then maybe they don’t There are jaculates (which is a group of sperm) and some of which do this well and some of which don’t ⇒ That can be a whole reason for infertility ‒ if you’re not able to deactivate the system, you’re not going to be able to get through, because the immune system is active Summary of the numbers of sperm 100 million ejaculated at the cervix 5 million get through the cervix, into the uterus 100-500 get to the fallopian tube 1 gets to the egg Paul jokes about why you need so many sperm The classic answer he used to give is they don’t like to ask for directions But these numbers illustrate why How sperm are made: meiosis, genetic variation, and the continuous renewal influenced by environmental factors [9:00] An important consideration for sperm is it can only have half the genetic information contained within all other cells in the man’s body When does that take place? The testicle makes sperm It takes about 60-70 days, and it’s a process called meiosis So in a car assembly line, cars are mass produced, and you want it all to be the same In meiosis (which is unlike mitosis), you want things to be different and to be a little easy-peasy You get what’s called recombination, and that’s the source of evolution The chromosomes blend in a different way and separate in a different way ⇒ Through that process, you get half the number of chromosomes, which is required to join the other half But it’s not always the same half Funny story about when Peter took the MCAT Peter had to take the MCAT before doing any of the pre-med stuff, because he had studied engineering before deciding he wanted to do medicine He didn’t want to spend 2 years preparing 1 year taking the post-bac and then the MCAT He decided to just wing it and take the MCAT, having never taken a biology class since high school (he took freshman biology) He’s studying his heart out for this, and the physics and chemistry are fine, but the biology is killing him He bought this cheap study guide (he didn’t want to splurge for the official study guide) And every time he encountered the word meiosis and mitosis, he assumed it was a spelling mistake because he bought a knockoff book (he thought it was just mitosis) Finally, on the night before the exam, he realized they were 2 totally different things There’s a big difference That realization might have gotten him into med school, because he thinks he barely got at 10 on the biology section It’s hard to get into a good med school if you get below that To this day, Peter gets such a chuckle out of the confusion of the nomenclature ⇒ Mitosis happens when cells are dividing in our body, where they’re trying to create a perfect replica of the entire suite of DNA while meiosis only occurs in the creation of an egg or a sperm Are women born with all of their eggs? 5 million eggs at conception 1 million eggs at birth You basically ovulate 1000 eggs in your lifetime 1 a month But you actually produce 10 a month, so you lose 10 eggs every month By the time you’re 45, you’re out of eggs There’s a lot of waste The eggs are stuck in a stage of perpetual space, and they get older but they don’t evolve They mature at the time they are asked to But sperm are constantly renewed Peter asks, “Is that just a mass space problem? Because the testes, if we did the same thing women did, would we just have to have an enormous set of testes?” Paul jokes, “Why do you think out of the box like that?” He’s not sure There’s a whole issue of what’s the source of human evolution It’s really sperm because they are constantly dividing, constantly influenced by the environment And they’re throwing off mutations and epigenetic changes What’s most interesting for Paul for this talk is that whatever happens in sperm, happens to offspring It’s transgenerational Does that mean that the father is more likely to pass on environmental stressors than the mother? Probably That’s definitely been shown ⇒ The sperm is the actual cell Where do sperm get the little tail from, and what is the other part of the cocktail? “One of the most magnificent transformations of a cell in the body is the making of a sperm.”‒ Paul Turek It starts with a spermatogonial stem cell, which looks like other cells That spermatogonial stem cell is actually the first and the bottom of a tube There’s 12 stages of spermatogenesis That cell is remarkable; it’s actually the human male embryonic stem cell Paul has a patent on that cell, because if you take that cell and you put it in a niche environment like an embryonic stem cell, it’ll become embryonic almost like it can become multipotent You can form tumors, and you can form bone, mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm You can do all three layers of the body with that adult spermatogonial stem cell Peter asks “Is there any other cell in the body that is capable of that?” {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Oldies-But-Goodies, June 2025 Edition",
      "content": "This week, I’m sharing another collection of oldies-but-goodies — pieces from our newsletter archive that address a variety of topics of continued interest to our audience. Some provide additional context for recent or upcoming content; some address frequently asked questions; and some are simply worth repeating for anyone who might have missed them. The world of biomedical science is constantly evolving, but in evaluating what has changed, we like to pause now and then to acknowledge information and ideas that have remained relevant despite the passage of time — a celebration of “aging well,” if you will. How failures in study selection can sink a meta-analysis After the initial results of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) indicated an increase in relative risk of breast cancer with the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), changes in HRT use occurred virtually overnight, resulting in generations of women being denied treatment. As I discussed in a recent conversation with Dr. Rachel Rubin, this reaction was based on faulty data and faulty interpretations, and as these misconceptions around HRT have gradually reversed, HRT is once again becoming a common treatment for menopausal symptoms and related emotional and physical concerns. So when a 2022 meta-analysis once again reported an increase in breast cancer risk with HRT,1 I feared history would repeat itself. When conducted well, meta-analyses can provide some of the highest quality of evidence in clinical research. However, whether or not they achieve this standard depends not only on the quality of the studies they include but also on how well those studies fit together to answer a given question. In this piece, we break down the 2022 meta-analysis, demonstrating how it fails to select studies that are appropriate for the research question it claims to address. So while the study may not provide new information about the risk of HRT use in breast cancer survivors, it does offer some important lessons on pitfalls in meta-analyses. Cumulative time spent in “vigorous” physical activity lowers mortality risk The health benefits of consistent physical activity across a variety of training modalities have been established by numerous studies, but every so often, a new headline or study proclaims some dubious way to cut corners on this vital aspect of a healthy lifestyle. We discussed one such study — which suggested that very brief (<2 minutes) bouts of vigorous physical activity adding up to just 54 minutes per week was “optimal” for reducing mortality risk2 — in this newsletter, pointing out the many flaws with the study and its apparent conclusions. Ultimately, short, random spurts of activity are no substitute for dedicated training. So instead of adding up the number of times you chase down your kids throughout the week and hoping this fulfills your health requirement to exercise, take a look at this podcast I did last summer on how to begin a more balanced and effective exercise program. Taurine improves the health and longevity of mice and monkeys – but what about humans? Humanity’s search for treatments that can reverse the effects of aging has been going on for millennia, but only in the last hundred or so years have potential geroprotective drugs been the subject of systematic scientific inquiry. Research to develop geroprotective drugs begins in model organisms such as mice, and when they show promise, they will often progress to primates before finally being studied in humans. So when a publication in the prestigious journal Science reported efficacy of the amino acid taurine in combatting aging in mice and monkeys,3 it sparked excitement that similar evidence in humans was soon to follow. But as we explained in this newsletter two years ago, taurine is more likely to become a case-study in one of the primary reasons why anti-aging interventions so often fail to translate from animals to humans: separate species differ in their physiology in ways that can fundamentally alter the impact of a given treatment. I recently sat down with Dr. Brian Kennedy, an expert in the field of aging science, to discuss this and other common roadblocks in research surrounding potential geroprotective molecules in an upcoming episode of The Drive, as well as to highlight pathways with greater promise as possible aging targets. Continuous glucose monitoring to improve health in non-diabetics One of the most harmful aspects of metabolic disease is the gradual decline in the body’s ability to control blood glucose levels, and thus, monitoring blood glucose dynamics in real time — i.e., with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) — has undeniable value for those with diabetes or prediabetes. But do CGM devices offer any benefit for those without existing metabolic dysfunction? This is hands-down one of the most common questions I receive with respect to metabolic health, and as discussed in detail in this newsletter from late 2023, my answer is a definite “yes.” Using a CGM provides valuable personalized information about blood glucose levels, including responses to certain foods, the effects of exercise, and the magnitude of glucose swings — which in turn can help to identify subclinical metabolic dysfunction. CGM is thus an important tool to direct changes in lifestyle toward optimal metabolic health, and as the saying goes, “what gets measured, gets managed.” Reassessing the relationship between alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease risk Last weekend was Memorial Day, meaning that summer has finally arrived — a time of backyard barbecues, vacations, and pool parties. For many, these festivities would hardly feel complete without a few beers, glasses of rosé, or cocktails. As such, there’s no better time to revisit some important lessons regarding the health risks of alcohol consumption. Though epidemiology has long suggested that low levels of alcohol consumption might be beneficial for health, this newsletter focuses on a more robust Mendelian randomization analysis, which found that all levels of alcohol exposure were associated with increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.4 Further, disease risk increased exponentially with progressive levels of alcohol consumption. The good news? This exponential relationship means that even small decreases in intake can yield enormous reductions in risk. So while the safest bet might be to skip the poolside rosé altogether, even cutting down from three glasses per day to two can reduce risk by over two-thirds… something to keep in mind throughout your summer socializing.

Show Notes The personalized rehab strategy for Peter’s shoulder surgery that sparked creation of a training program called 10 Squared [3:00] A few years ago, when Peter was in the throes of recovery from shoulder surgery, he and Kyler had this idea to put together 2 things that seemed unrelated His recovery from an injury The idea of a Centenarian Decathlon in a marginal decade [episode #261 goes into detail about the Centenarian Decathlon] Peter met Kyler 4 years ago, as soon as he moved to Austin They worked on preventative stuff: DNS and routine maintenance [episode #152 goes into detail about DNS] On the second or third visit, Kyler asked about Peter’s shoulder And that kicked off this whole conversation because in Kyler’s world, this idea of just doing one technique or providing one service isn’t really a complete approach Peter had torn his labrum before The diagnosis was made in 2009 when he had his first arthrogram done This is a MRI where prior to you going in the scanner, the radiologist takes a needle about 4 inches long, shoots the needle into the capsule and injects contrast so that it really allows the MRI to show the labrum and how much it’s detached from the glenoid fossa It was significantly torn but not as torn as it would be 13 years later Peter had largely avoided surgery by doing as much as he could to strengthen the rotator cuff And frankly, he was afraid to have surgery He didn’t want to trade one problem for another He didn’t want to trade want to trade pain and instability for immobility Folks listening may recall his discussion with the amazing surgeon Alton Barron on the podcast [episode #232] who ultimately did the repair What Peter was most impressed by in that experience was that Kyler and Alton started working as a team Talk a little about what you guys did 8 weeks prior to Peter’s shoulder surgery One of the things as a rehab professional that Kyler really appreciated was how Alton didn’t want to just cinch down that joint to where his liability was so covered that that shoulder would be strong, but then have Peter lose a ton of function One of the key things that Alton did was he put the staples and the sutures in the right places to where that shoulder would be functional (he did just the right amount) And Kyler worked with Peter to get his shoulder well before more significant structural compromise It’s a really important window to do so Kyler remembers that conversation ‒ Peter had a date several months out where he was like, “I’m going to have to use my arm a lot. I need to be strong.” Peter wanted to be able to hunt in September So the surgery needed to be no later than March It was January, and the question was should he do the surgery right away or use 2 months to prehab? How did you think about that question? That conversation was one of Kyler’s favorites because he’s done this before where if we know the big picture goal as well as the near term surgical date, and then we reverse engineer Okay, I want to check off a certain amount of things preoperatively to where that joint is ready Essentially in the most simple terms, what you’re looking for in that situation, is you want to make all the muscles around the shoulder just awesome Especially with the shoulder because it’s such a mobile joint But we need to do so in a way that doesn’t make the surgery more complicated or injure you more He combined a lot of things Technology like BFR [blood flow restriction discussed in episode #179] Aggressive approaches on core stability The way the scapula interacts with ribs and all these things have an effect on how the shoulder moves If the mobile shoulder that has a torn labrum isn’t stable and doesn’t have a support infrastructure around it, you’re always going to ask for more pain Once things were healing from the surgery itself, all those other ancillary things were actually functioning really well So now we only had to really target the shoulder itself because the rest of the human was really strong and ready What Peter remembers How much rotator cuff work he did ahead of time, particularly around supraspinatus He got that muscle as strong as possible in 8 weeks Anyone who’s gone through that type of rehab knows it’s uncomfortable You’re burning a tiny muscle that’s not used to working that hard “The second thing that I remember and hands down the most important thing was what you and Alton decided to do postoperatively completely shattered everyone’s understanding of what we do with these patients.”‒ Peter Attia Peter didn’t have a slap tear, his labrum was hanging on by a thread Traditionally a surgeon’s primary objective is to make sure that is never unstable again Cincy it down really tight The patient will be in a sling for 4-6 weeks, and that’s going to give it plenty of time to heal But you’ll never regain mobility, never regain the healthy range of motion, and you’ll probably atrophy away ⇒ Alton’s goal was to have Peter out of a sling in 24 hours Kyler points out, “The broader picture here is what we touched on, the liability. And it’s really difficult for modern physicians and rehab pros to integrate.” Professional sports try to achieve this as well, but they have time constraints and all these other constraints with how many people they’re working with Ignoring all those layers, the most important thing is Alton and Kyler had these conversations in detail and Alton was really specific about, “Okay, did we get the training we talked about? Is that supraspinatus, the serratus anterior, all these other muscles that help stabilize? Are those really good?” Kyler had some metrics he was able to discuss with Alton, and Alton felt confident in the stability of Peter’s shoulder The decision about no sling was based on the preparation they did and what they knew The other thing was Peter followed everything to a T “One of the big complications in rehab (athlete or not) is are people following the rules?”‒ Kyler Brown If we take this individual out of a sling, are they going to forget about it and all of a sudden go reach for the cereal or are they going to follow the rules? Peter was definitely a rule follower So Alton and Kyler had high confidence in minimizing the risk Peter learned a lot the hard way from his first orthopedic surgery in 2000 He’s not even convinced he received post-operative instructions And if he did, he didn’t read them He was breaking every rule there were Peter’s labrum repair surgery The stakes were higher here in a way Peter was very mindful When you have surgery, you tend to go on YouTube to learn all about it He wanted to see everything: the post-operative, the rehab process Post-surgery exercise One of the big milestones you see for people with labral surgery is when they basically can dangle the arm and rotate a light weight Alton was really clear, “You’re not going to be doing that for a while. We’re talking about range of motion without stress on the repair.” Very early on pre-operatively and post, we were able to do very gentle but targeted isometrics where there wasn’t complexity in the joint itself, but we were loading the tissues in a very articulate and specific way And that’s how you again put the support structure around it Kyler describes as the roll cage in a car, we want all the muscles around that to be ready to absorb force So those joint structures that are getting the staples or whatever else in there aren’t stressed We don’t want to yank on those things while they’re healing Training for the marginal decade: why precision and purpose are essential for quality of life [11:00] In parallel to this, Peter continued to refine his thinking around the idea that we’re all going to have this marginal decade one day {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "A timely — though tragic — lesson on prostate cancer screening",
      "content": "As most of you are likely aware, last weekend it was announced that former President Joe Biden had been diagnosed with stage 4 (i.e., metastatic) prostate cancer. Putting politics and conspiracy theories aside, and speaking strictly from a medical perspective, the news is nothing short of a tragic demonstration of Medicine 2.0 at its worst. Prostate cancer is one of the very few forms of cancer for which metastasis, and therefore mortality, are almost entirely preventable. Thus, news of such advanced disease in anyone is unacceptable in my mind. But the fact that this occurred in a man who presumably was receiving the best possible medical care — a man whose health had, until recently, been a matter of national security — underscores a bitter truth: despite our ability to catch and treat prostate cancer well before it spreads, this form of cancer remains the second leading causing of cancer deaths among men. Around 35,000 men die of prostate cancer each year in the United States alone,1 and most of those deaths are preventable. Tragic indeed. As such, I’d like to take this high-profile case as an opportunity to try to make some small dent in those numbers. In the video below, I explain why prostate cancer still contributes to so many unnecessary deaths and what you can do to prevent yourself or your loved ones from becoming part of those terrible statistics someday. In addition to the video, I have summarized some of these points in-text below. <iframe width=\"790\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hnamfo1AzWc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Why screening recommendations fall short One of the reasons why prostate cancer mortality is so preventable is that it tends to develop fairly slowly, so it’s usually possible to catch it in early stages through screening via a blood test for a protein made by prostate cells, prostate-specific antigen, or PSA. Of course, this is only true if screening is performed regularly and if the data are interpreted correctly, which requires some nuance. Blanket use of PSA in a paint-by-numbers fashion — high vs. low cutoffs — is of limited use, but sadly forms the basis of most guidelines. The current guidelines are to perform annual PSA tests for men between the ages of 55–69, whereas no screening is recommended for men 70 years of age or older. The rationale behind this cessation of screening? Because prostate cancer can take several years to develop and reach advanced stages, men with a life expectancy of less than 10 years are unlikely to experience any extension of lifespan by screening for such a slow-progressing disease, as something else will probably kill them first. Or so the theory goes. However, there are a few critical flaws with this logic: It is not uncommon for men to live well beyond the age of 80, so we can’t assume that any given 70-year-old man will die within the next 10 years. Certain cases of prostate cancer are more aggressive than others, so even a 10-year life expectancy might well be cut in half if we ignore prostate cancer as a possibility. Catching prostate cancer before it spreads is more than just a matter of extending lifespan — it has the potential to drastically improve quality of life in those final years. Even if PSA tests over age 70 don’t confer any potential survival benefit, which I would argue they certainly do if done correctly, they can still allow us to detect and treat cancer before it leads to excruciating and debilitating bone metastases. The failure of these screening guidelines is apparent in the case of the former president himself — an 82-year-old man who received his last PSA test in 2014 at the age of 72, who now faces a painful battle with advanced disease. What you can do Unfortunately, even news of President Biden’s diagnosis is unlikely to prompt any major changes to screening recommendations, so many physicians may continue to advise their older patients against continued PSA checks. But patients aren’t helpless in the face of faulty guidelines. Advocate for yourself with physicians by specifically requesting a PSA test. We’ve received countless stories from men who caught prostate cancer early because they pushed their doctors. The tests are covered by Medicare for anyone over 50, and even without insurance, PSA tests are fairly low cost — typically $5-30 depending on the service and location. A small price to pay for potentially huge dividends for health. The table, below, summarizes how we use PSA in our practice to screen men for prostate cancer. Even if this message doesn’t [yet] apply to you — whether young or old, male or female — you can spread the word (and perhaps provide a friendly push) to those you love. The more people who hear of the shortcomings of screening recommendations, the more of a dent we might make in the deaths and suffering attributable to a largely preventable disease.

Show Notes Peter’s humorous experience talking nutrition with a second grader [2:30] Peter’s Story: Lunch at His Son’s School Peter shares he had lunch at his son’s school, something he occasionally enjoys doing. His son wasn’t in the mood to have lunch with him, so Peter ate alone at a cafeteria table. A group of his son’s classmates eventually joined him out of sympathy. The casual conversation evolved into a back-and-forth Q&A session about science and other topics. The Diet Soda Incident One student noticed Peter drinking a Fresca and pointed out it contains a sweetener “500 times sweeter than sugar.” The student warned, “You know that causes cancer, right?” Peter internally decided it wasn’t the right time to debate scientific literature on artificial sweeteners. The student clarified it wouldn’t kill Peter quickly because he was only drinking a small amount. Peter appreciated the child’s awareness and concern, calling it an “astute comment” for a 7-year-old. Closing thought on the school visit Peter notes he had a great time and would be interested in returning to his son’s school for lunch again. Nick reminds the audience that Peter usually avoids talking about his work at adult social events. He finds it amusing that Peter got pulled into a detailed health discussion by second graders instead. Podcast episode idea: gather a panel of elementary school kids to share their thoughts on health topics—nutrition, exercise, protein, microplastics, seed oils, etc. He says if the audience wants it, he’s game to gather a group of 7-year-olds and have a deep dive into health issues from their perspective. Overview of topics, episode structure, and reasoning for focus on muscle mass and strength [6:00] Intro to the Episode’s Focus Today’s AMA will cover a single topic: muscle mass and muscle strength. This topic has been discussed on previous podcast episodes but is being addressed here as a focused, standalone AMA. Layne Norton – previous podcast guest Andy Galpin – previous podcast guest Mike Israetel – previous podcast guest The conversation will explore: Why muscle mass and strength are important The differences between the two Which one matters more How to increase both (for all ages and genders) The role of nutrition and protein Different training and programming options for different populations Why Dedicate an AMA to This Now? 1. High Volume of Listener Questions Muscle-related topics remain one of the top three most frequently asked topics in their audience Q&A submissions. It’s a highly relevant and in-demand topic that continues to generate interest. 2. Information Overload Across Multiple Episodes There is already ~20+ hours of podcast content on this topic, spread across various episodes and interviews. This AMA aims to: Streamline and organize all that content into one accessible conversation. Deliver the essential takeaways at the “zeroth and first order levels” for easy digestion. Use show notes and supplemental materials to allow deeper exploration for those who want to dive further. Defining key terms: muscle mass, strength, hypertrophy, power, and more [8:15] Defining Muscle Mass and Muscle Strength Muscle mass and muscle strength are often used interchangeably but are in fact distinct. Muscle mass = the total amount of skeletal muscle in the body. The three types of muscle in the body: Cardiac muscle: resembles skeletal muscle but functions continuously throughout life. Smooth muscle: quite different from skeletal muscle; found in organs like the digestive tract. Skeletal muscle: the majority of muscle mass; has contractile properties to generate force and plays both: Structural roles (e.g. movement, posture) Metabolic roles (e.g. glucose uptake, energy expenditure) Muscle Strength = the ability to exert force to overcome resistance. Though it may seem intuitive, Peter emphasizes it’s different from mass and worth clearly defining. Strength is functionally relevant: not about size, but about output.

      "title": "Increased REM sleep latency and Alzheimer’s disease: important risk factor or red herring?",
      "content": "I’ve often highlighted the importance of quality sleep for cognitive health, but might certain sleep metrics actually serve as an indicator of neurodegenerative disease? In light of a recent study reporting a correlation between increased REM sleep latency (the amount of time between becoming unconscious and entering REM sleep) and the severity of neurodegenerative biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD),1 some health influencers believe the answer is “yes” — and they’ve even gone so far as to advocate for using REM sleep latency measurements from one’s home sleep trackers as a biomarker for brain health. However, while the study may have provided a small piece of information about the relationship between neurodegeneration and sleep architecture, trying to use the study to evaluate or intervene on one’s own health based on REM sleep latency is a waste of time at best. Specifics of the study This cross-sectional study examined 128 adults (mean age: 70.8 years; 56.9% female), of which 64 had Alzheimer’s disease, 41 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 23 were cognitively normal. Individuals with certain known sleep disorders or forms of dementia other than AD or MCI (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) were excluded. The investigators used overnight polysomnography (PSG) to evaluate sleep architecture, with metrics including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, REM latency, and time spent in each sleep stage. To evaluate the severity of AD pathophysiology, they assessed three plasma biomarkers of AD (p-tau181, NfL, BDNF) and employed positron emission tomography (PET) to quantitate amyloid β (Aβ) deposition. After adjusting for confounding variables such as age, sex, BMI, and APOE-ε4 status, the researchers found a handful of significant associations between various sleep parameters and AD pathology. While most of these associations were abolished after applying corrections for multiple comparisons (an essential adjustment to avoid false positives; explained in more detail here), two remained statistically significant — both of which related to the metric of REM latency. Specifically, they found that, compared with those in the lowest tertile of REM sleep latency (<98.2 min), those in the highest tertile (>192.7 min) had higher PET Aβ burdens (β=0.07; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.12) and reduced BDNF levels (β=−0.50; 95% CI: −0.69, −0.19). Based on these data, the authors propose that extended REM sleep latency might be an early warning sign of neurodegenerative disease and may have value in tracking progression of AD. Some health influencers have taken this interpretation a step further, advising their audiences to use their at-home wearable sleep trackers to self-diagnose their own Aβ burdens. But before you run off to pore through your sleep data and put a neurologist on speed dial, let’s take a closer look at these claims — and why they are deeply unserious. The direction of the causal arrow As I mentioned at the outset, yes, sleep absolutely influences long-term cognitive health. But here’s the kicker — cognitive health also influences sleep. All forms of dementia involve dramatic changes to the brain’s structure and function, and disruptions in sleep timing and sleep architecture are observed in all types of neurodegeneration. Specifically, there is an extremely high prevalence of sleep disorders observed in AD, and dysregulation of sleep is one of the most common and difficult to manage symptoms of AD.2 The finding that the severity of AD pathology is correlated with increased REM sleep latency is thus not particularly surprising given the known (and almost certainly causal) role that neurodegenerative diseases play in sleep dysfunction. Should we be concerned about the possibility of a causal connection going the other direction? That is, should we be concerned that longer REM sleep latency per se might increase one’s risk of developing cognitive decline or dementia? Again, ensuring adequate quality sleep is one of the most important things you can do to protect your brain, but critically, this study provides no evidence that REM sleep latency in particular is any more or less important than any other sleep parameter in this respect. As a purely observational study, it can’t provide any evidence that the REM sleep latency (or any other aspect of sleep) has any impact on cognitive trajectories. It demonstrates nothing about causality. Is REM latency a marker of cognitive health? Still, putting the question of causality aside, what about the claim that REM latency might be uniquely valuable as a marker of cognitive health or AD progression? Here, too, this study falls short. Not only was this an observational study, it was a cross-sectional observational study, meaning that it simply looked at data from one snapshot in time. The researchers did not examine changes in REM sleep latency over time and how they tracked with the development or progression of neurodegenerative disorders. It was merely an observation that those with more severe AD pathology appear to have longer REM sleep latency. Further, most of the participants in this study already had AD or MCI, at which point reverse causality (i.e., neurodegenerative disease causing extended REM latency) becomes extremely likely. So even if REM sleep might serve as a marker of disease progression in those with baseline AD, it makes little sense to extrapolate this finding to make the recommendation that cognitively normal people should monitor their cognitive health by tracking REM latency. In no way does this work provide evidence that REM sleep latency differences in those who are healthy are correlated with risk of developing neurodegenerative disease. Indeed, REM sleep latency is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon such that even saying whether a “shorter” or “longer” latency is good or bad is impossible. Many disorders, such as major depression and narcolepsy, involve shortened REM sleep latency. Sleep apnea, medication use, stress, chronic inflammation, and myriad other factors also affect REM sleep latency in diverse ways which may themselves impact neurodegenerative disease. To illustrate this point, consider the fact that sleep deprivation itself also tends to shorten REM sleep latency. The conclusions made by the study authors (and the social media claims surrounding this study) would imply that someone who is chronically sleep-deprived — but who therefore has relatively short REM sleep latency — would be cognitively healthier than someone who regularly gets sufficient sleep but whose REM latency is a bit longer. This, of course, is absurd, yet it demonstrates why REM sleep latency on its own has no utility as a biomarker for cognitive health or neurodegenerative disease progression. Limitations of at-home wearables A separate but important point to keep in mind concerns the limitations of at-home wearables, such as watches and rings, that purport to track your sleep. Data from this study derived from polysomnography tests performed in a sleep clinic, not from wearable sleep trackers. So even if we put aside the countless other problems, the notion that this study justifies making at-home judgements about cognitive health based on personal sleep trackers is a step too far. These wearable devices will often report your sleep architecture (which is to say, how much and when you experienced various phases of sleep), and they can sometimes provide interesting and useful data in specific circumstances, but information gathered from them should be taken with a large grain of salt. They are not a replacement for polysomnography, and should not be used for making medical decisions. These devices all use different technology to track sleep and different algorithms to assess sleep architecture, and whether they are able to accurately measure REM sleep latency at all is unclear. A red herring for cognitive health tracking We know sleep is vital for cognitive health. So when a study comes along that suggests a particular aspect of sleep — namely, REM sleep latency — has unique value in tracking cognitive trajectories and neurodegenerative disease, it may be tempting to scan through your sleep tracker data and panic if this specific metric appears a little off-target. Yet in reality, this study is a far cry from providing clinically actionable insights capable of guiding treatment decisions or lifestyle changes. Yes, sleep quality — of which REM sleep latency is just a single element — has an impact on cognitive health, but the brain changes that accompany neurodegenerative disorders also have an impact on sleep, potentially including REM sleep latency. The latter impact is just as likely as (if not more likely than) the former to explain the results of the present study, so we have no evidence that targeting an optimal REM sleep latency will in any way improve cognitive trajectories or reduce AD risk. Indeed, this study doesn’t even offer real evidence that using REM sleep latency as a biomarker of cognitive health has any utility whatsoever, especially for those who are healthy. So in this case, the alarm over REM latency and neurodegenerative disease is little more than a red herring — just another drop in an endless sea of misinterpreted information.

Show Notes Rachel’s training in urology and passion for sexual medicine and women’s health [3:00] Help us understand how your training in urology led you to what you’re doing today When we think of urology, we think about prostates, kidneys, bladders But what you forget is that urologists are ultimately the quality of life doctors We deal with urination problems and we deal with sexual medicine “No one cares about erections and orgasm and libido quite the way that a urologist cares… it’s not a gender thing.”‒ Rachel Rubin We’re not penis doctors only: we are board certified to take care of everybody’s genital and urinary tracts Unfortunately, society has led us to know a lot more about the men’s sexual health and men’s genitals than female genitals Rachel trained in urology because she was interested in women’s health, but she was also interested in sexual health, sexual medicine She didn’t like delivering babies, didn’t like OB/GYN What she loves about urology is that she can see everybody and she can really dive deep on quality of life issues The magic of urology is also that you really get to know your patients It’s not like when you did surgery, you take out someone’s appendix and you never see them again Maybe you do one post-op visit Urologists have deep relationships, we’re both surgeons but we actually care about the medical side of these quality of life issues As she was going through medical school, she really realized that talking about sexual health and quality of life issues was fun for her It’s just been a joy She’s been working to further the field of urology to make us better at taking care of women Rachel does a lot of educating and teaching to her colleagues about how we really need to care about the whole, everybody Hormonal changes during ovulation, perimenopause, and menopause: why they occur and how they impact women’s health and quality of life [5:30] Peter wants to talk about it from a female standpoint today because there’s a dearth of great information out there and an abundance of garbage information out there He appreciates Rache’s breadth of knowledge that covers both sexes, but he wants to talk about women specifically Menopause: an obvious difference between men and women from an endocrine perspective Menopause is a sudden and abrupt loss of sex hormones That is in contrast to the way men’s sex hormones decline over time a little more slowly Listeners of this podcast are highly erudite [menopause is discussed in episodes #42, #253, #256, #259, and others] Give a quick overview of what is happening to women in menopause Rachel got an interesting email last week that said, “Dr. Rubin, my wife is seeing your practice. Her libido is now like an F1 Formula One race car. And I’m like a 1988 Honda Civic. What can you do for me?” Rachel’s gas tank analogy: as men age, sometimes we see a decrease in their gas tank Men are feeling low, they’re feeling down, they’ve got erectile dysfunction, low libido Whereas women at age 52, their gas tank is empty ‒ this is a castration event We don’t have many castration events in men’s health “Menopause is sort of a, your gas tank is officially empty. There’s not much in the tank.”‒ Rachel Rubin Perimenopause is this time where it’s very erratic The gas tank is over full, and then it goes to empty really quickly without warning This analogy is helpful when we’re talking to women about the reason you don’t feel like yourself is because there’s just no gas in the tank {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Do fat cells “remember” obesity even after weight loss?",
      "content": "For anyone who has lost a significant amount of weight, keeping it off can feel even harder than losing it in the first place. Even with disciplined habits and strong motivation, the body often seems to push back. Why? A new study sheds light on this frustration, suggesting that fat cells might retain a molecular “memory” of obesity, long after you’ve lost weight.1 Much media coverage has interpreted this discovery as validation for the hopelessness of weight loss, but is this conclusion merited? While this study does offer crucial insights into how biology can subtly influence your metabolic health, a closer examination reveals key questions still remaining. The molecular echo of obesity Researchers Hinte et al. explored whether obesity leaves a biological imprint, not by changing DNA itself, but through epigenetic modifications — molecular changes that alter how the genes of DNA are expressed. Their findings reveal that obesity might imprint fat cells in ways that linger, even after significant weight loss. In their study, the scientists analyzed gene expression in adipose tissue samples from individuals with severe obesity who had undergone bariatric surgery and had maintained at least a 25% reduction in BMI two years after the procedure. They compared gene expression from these samples with samples from participants prior to surgery-induced weight loss as well as with samples obtained from lean, never-obese controls. The results were striking: the previously obese individuals’ fat cells (adipocytes) continued to behave abnormally even two years after weight loss. In both pre- and post-weight loss adipose tissue samples, pathways related to the metabolism and function of adipocytes were consistently expressed less, while those related to fibrosis and cell death were expressed more, than non-obese controls. In other words, certain dysregulations in gene expression associated with obesity do not resolve with weight loss, such that the cells behave as if they “remember” being obese. To dig deeper into the molecular unpinnings of this “memory,” Hinte et al. turned to mechanistic experiments in mice. Excess weight gain was induced in adult mice by feeding them a high-fat diet for a period of either 12 or 25 weeks, after which the mice were switched to a standard chow diet, resulting in weight loss. As controls, separate groups of mice were fed with standard chow continuously to remain lean throughout the experiment. Even after high-fat-fed mice returned to a healthy weight, fat cells retained epigenetic markers linked to inflammation and impaired fat storage, similar to the phenotype in the human samples. Overall, most of the downregulated (57–62%) and upregulated (68–75%) differentially expressed genes could be explained by at least one of the studied epigenetic factors. The convergence of mouse and human data suggest that adipocytes indeed retain many epigenetic features of an obese phenotype. But what are the practical consequences of this type of “memory” of obesity? When these formerly obese mice faced a high-fat diet again, they regained weight nearly twice as fast as mice who had never been obese. After this second high-fat diet period, the epigenetic signatures could account for 31% of upregulated and 60% of downregulated differentially expressed genes. Adipose tissue also exhibited greater glucose and fatty acid uptake compared to lean controls, as well as showing impaired development of new, healthy fat cells (or “adipogenesis”). Impairments in adipogenesis can lead to dysfunctional fat storage, with lipids spilling into non-adipose tissues (like liver or muscle) and creating an inflammatory environment that often precedes metabolic disease. Taken together, these findings suggest that obesity imprints a lasting molecular signature on adipose tissue. Even after weight loss, these changes persist and may predispose the body to respond more aggressively to future high-fat or high-calorie exposure, priming the body for metabolically unhealthy fat storage. But does this “memory” actually cause weight regain? Translating fat cell memory into practical insights Despite the compelling findings that fat cells show a form of “memory” for obesity, these data don’t show that weight regain is attributable to epigenetic changes within fat cells themselves. It is true that the difficulty keeping weight off after weight loss has a biological basis, and it is currently understood to involve disrupted leptin signaling. Leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells, signals to the brain that the body is satiated and has sufficient energy stores in the form of fat. After significant weight loss, leptin levels drop sharply, prompting the brain to react as though the body is starving (even if ample fat mass is still present), thereby increasing hunger and food cravings and reducing energy expenditure (for more detail on leptin and its role in weight dynamics, refer to my podcast episode with Dr. Rudy Leibel). Because leptin originates from fat cells, it is plausible that adipose tissue epigenetic alterations such as those identified by Hinte et al. could influence leptin dynamics and thus indirectly drive weight regain. However, the present study did not investigate this possibility, so future work is necessary to establish this causal link. So if we can’t be sure that epigenetic changes contribute to weight regain, we’re left with the question: what does this study tell us? At most, it suggests that adipose tissue in formerly obese individuals retains a pro-inflammatory, metabolically altered phenotype. So while the maintained features don’t fully explain why people regain weight, they could explain why previously obese individuals remain more vulnerable to metabolic diseases — even after maintaining weight loss. As an analogy, we can imagine fat cell memory as akin to a knee injury. Injuring your knee might not cause re-injury, but it has the potential lasting consequence of pain and stiffness. As such, it is plausible that conditions such as insulin resistance, fatty liver, and abnormal fat storage are all more likely if this epigenetic “memory” persists. Other practical questions remain open: the human data came from individuals who were sufficiently obese to merit bariatric surgery and dropped in BMI by at least 25%, but will similar molecular changes occur with less dramatic weight loss? And do epigenetic changes continue indefinitely, or could fat cells eventually “forget” their past? In short: this isn’t a story about weight regulation. It’s a story about metabolic resilience — or the lack thereof — in the post-obese state. And that’s a meaningful message, albeit a very different one from the headlines that have surrounded this study to date. Weight loss is still beneficial for health At first consideration, the finding that weight reduction fails to reverse various pathological features of obesity can make any weight loss efforts seem hopeless. But it’s important to recognize that this study was not designed to capture the many, many established ways in which reduction in fat mass does improve metabolic, cardiovascular, mental, and cognitive health. Fat cells might retain a molecular memory, but that is a far cry from indicating that weight loss does not have numerous, profound benefits for health and well-being. Indeed, even the possibility [as yet untested] that these epigenetic changes might increase risk of weight regain should reinforce, not diminish, your commitment to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, as maintaining a lean state following obesity will require dedicated effort — but those efforts pay clear, long-term dividends.

      "title": "A more holistic approach to chronic back pain",
      "content": "Chronic low back pain has a frustrating reputation. Many who experience it are familiar with a cycle of hope and disappointment — trying physical therapies, adjusting posture, diligently performing stretches and exercises, only to find relief to be temporary at best. It’s almost as though something fundamental has been overlooked. Indeed, research strongly suggests exactly that. While chronic back pain is often viewed as just a physical malfunction waiting to be mechanically repaired, it is instead a multidimensional experience connected with our emotions, thoughts, and everyday interactions. Consider, for instance, how stress and anxiety amplify our perception of pain, prolonging episodes that might otherwise be brief. This mind-body connection, which underlies the “biopsychosocial model” of chronic pain, is a growing area of interest, and, as a 2023 study by Bemani et al. suggests, it holds promising implications for treatment of low back pain.1 A multidimensional approach to treating pain Bemani et al. explored whether integrating psychological strategies into physiotherapy would yield better pain reduction compared to traditional physiotherapy alone. Seventy participants with moderate chronic low back pain (defined as self-reported pain between a 3 and 7 on a scale of 1 to 10 and lasting for at least 3 months) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to standard physiotherapy or a multidimensional therapy approach. Standard physiotherapy included structured education on spinal anatomy, muscle-strengthening exercises, and passive treatments like ultrasound and electrotherapy, whereas the multidimensional therapy included these interventions plus psychological techniques based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). These techniques involved understanding pain neuroscience (for those curious, they based this on the book Explain Pain 2), developing coping strategies, managing anxiety, and gradually confronting movements they previously feared. Treatment sessions actively engaged patients, with frequent discussions and tailored home assignments designed to reinforce new skills. Both groups participated in two treatment sessions per week for six weeks. Initially, both groups improved along similar trajectories, with average pain scores falling from about 5 out of 10 down to roughly 2 out of 10 by the end of the 6-week treatment (control baseline=5.03±0.95; experimental baseline=5.03±0.92; control 6-week=2.43±1.85; experimental 6-week=1.86±1.65). While the experimental group demonstrated a slightly greater drop, this difference between groups was not statistically significant, so based on these results, we might be tempted to view psychological interventions as merely an added bonus with no substantial impact on the patients’ experience of pain itself. However, participants were then followed for a number of weeks after the end of 6-week interventions, and this post-treatment period revealed divergence between the two groups. By 10 weeks from the study start, the control group’s pain score began to rise while the experimental group remained steady (control 10-week=3.29±2.01; experimental 10-week=1.74±1.74) — a moderate but statistically significant between-group difference. This trend continued, and at the 22-week timepoint, the control group again had increased in average pain score and the experimental group had not (control 22-week=3.86±2.35; experimental 22-week=1.66±2.00). Statistically, the difference at this final timepoint was considered a large between-group effect (effect size =-0.89; 95% CI=-1.38 to -0.39). Notably, the study found comparable improvements in disability scores across both groups. Physical functioning (e.g., walking, bending, performing daily tasks) improved similarly, irrespective of treatment type. Interpreting these results Overall, Bemani et al.’s results indicate that standard physiotherapy and a multidimensional approach perform comparably in temporary pain alleviation, but only the latter fundamentally alters the underlying processes perpetuating chronic discomfort. The more holistic approach seemed to equip patients with enduring tools to manage pain flare-ups and stressors, thereby transforming their long-term relationship with pain. Chronic pain isn’t just about physical function; it’s about how we interpret, respond to, and manage discomfort when it arises. While physical interventions help restore muscle and joint function, psychological strategies may change how individuals experience and relate to pain — which perhaps explains why the two interventions did not differ in results with respect to disability scores. Interestingly, this explanation is somewhat at odds with the fact that the study reported no between-group differences in pain catastrophizing (thoughts that magnify the experience of pain) and kinesiophobia (fear of movement). The lack of significance on these secondary outcomes may reflect an insufficient sample size, or perhaps these specific negative thought patterns do not underlie the benefit of psychological treatment on pain. Additionally, while the improvements with a multidimensional approach are encouraging, it is important to remember that this was a small-scale study with limited diversity among participants. The study was restricted to those between the ages of 18-50, yet chronic low back pain is increasingly prevalent with age, so it will be important to determine how the addition of psychological techniques might improve pain management in those over 50. Further, those with anxiety or depression were excluded from the study, and since these conditions are often comorbid with chronic pain and often treated in part with CBT, it would be interesting to see if this group might benefit more from a multidimensional approach to pain treatment than what was observed in this study cohort. Regardless, these data demonstrate that integrating psychological interventions can meaningfully enhance the effectiveness of chronic pain management — despite leaving us with questions as to precisely how they have this effect and how it might vary across different individuals. Real-word application So why is it that a biopsychological approach to pain management is not yet the standard of care? Any new therapy takes time and extensive study before it’s fully accepted and adopted by the medical community, but some barriers to implementing multidimensional care in routine practice may also relate to broader perceptions at the societal and individual level. Patients might initially feel skeptical about incorporating psychological treatments into pain management, perhaps interpreting it as a suggestion that their pain is “all in their head.” Shifting this perspective is vital. Pain science, as discussed recently on The Drive by Dr. Sean Mackey, unequivocally supports the interplay of mind and body. The emotional and psychological elements don’t diminish the reality of physical pain; rather, they represent a crucial dimension that we must address explicitly. What’s more encouraging is that integrating these psychological approaches doesn’t necessarily require specialized mental health practitioners in every case. Many physiotherapists can be trained to implement basic psychological and educational techniques effectively — discussing pain neuroscience, demonstrating coping strategies, and gently guiding patients through feared activities. Such integration makes this multidimensional approach more accessible, practical, and scalable across diverse clinical settings. Breaking the pain cycle Chronic low back pain isn’t merely a physical issue to be mechanically repaired; it’s deeply influenced by emotional and psychological factors. Critically, this is not to say that chronic pain is “all in the head,” but to dismiss the role of the mind altogether, particularly in our experience and response to pain, is to ignore a vital target for pain treatment. As the biopsychological model posits, an individual’s thoughts, beliefs, and environment can influence the intensity and duration of their pain, and integrating psychological strategies like cognitive-behavioral techniques into physiotherapy may help sustain pain relief over time. Embracing this holistic approach may ultimately help to break the cycle of hope and disappointment that plagues so many suffering from recurring low back pain.

Show Notes Susan’s medical training, the start of the AIDS epidemic, and the transformative experiences that shaped her career [3:00] Susan grew up in Reno, NV Went to Catholic school for 12 years Attended the University of Nevada, both to undergrad and and to medical school Her dream residency was internal medicine at UCSF and she got her first pick (that was in 1982) Remind me where we were in the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco in ’82. What was known? The first indication of AIDS was in MMWR in 1981 In 1982, we knew something was happening, especially to gay men There was a sense it was homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and Haitians (the 3 H’s) There was so much mystery still involved that Susan and her colleagues were in a study to look at drawing their blood to see if they had been infected as a result of treating patients What were they presenting with at the time? It’s hard for anyone of Peter’s generation to imagine, having never seen a drug-naive patient These men would present with Pneumocystis cariniipneumonia This was unusual because it was a disease that immunosuppressed patients could get very rarely Most clinicians had never seen it before What was also clear is that there were many other infections that were not as obvious or life-threatening as pneumocystis was when we saw it right away What was interesting from an outpatient perspective was Kaposi’s sarcoma Kaposi’s sarcoma is a really unusual purple-colored tumor, very visible externally It caused nodules In patients with HIV infection, it also caused internal organ involvement Patients would cough up blood or they would vomit blood What was really sad and difficult is the combination of cachexia and Kaposi’s sarcoma meant that everybody knew you had AIDS (you sort of wore it) What was interesting for Susan was that this old-fashioned Kaposi’s sarcoma was fundamentally different than what we were seeing Kaposi’s sarcoma was a very big problem in San Francisco It was very common in gay men, and it was common in the population we saw We also saw a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in numbers much smaller Was there ever a sense of fear among the medical staff that we don’t know what this is, we don’t know how it’s transmitted, and therefore we don’t know how to protect each other or ourselves or other patients for that matter? It’s hard for Peter to imagine given how much we take for granted today Susan thinks it’s probably a reflection of her personality and wish to be a physician that her memories of those days are much more about sadness about her patients About people her age dying A story that brings it to life Many patients started selling their life insurance because they were sure they wouldn’t live long enough and they wanted the money now Then when the antiretroviral therapy came along, they wished they hadn’t Susan was just really sad Fears about contagion There were fears about the residents and about contagion But in San Francisco there was such a wish to help the patients, and such a good spirit about playing a role in helping, that we all persevered For the first patients Susan took care of in the hospital (in 1982), she was gowned, gloved, masked, and had a cap on It was like going into an operating room You finished your residency in internal medicine. Did you go directly into your fellowship? Susan did a chief residency at the university hospital for 1 year That was the first time she knew she really liked managing She liked interacting with people and helping people succeed After that year, she went to an oncology fellowship Susan adds, “To this day I love oncology. If you love medicine, and I do, and you love patients, and I do, it’s the combination of you get to call on your compassion gene and your nerdy science gene.” When she was at the VA in Reno as a third year medical student, she had an attending (Stephen Hall), and he was the oncologist who was teaching her about medicine She loved everything about how he showed up She loved his compassion, his intellect After that, she had this bug in her mind, she wanted to be like him Peter can relate, when he was in his third year of medical school, he went to NCI for 3 months with Steve Rosenberg It was the exact same experience He remembers learning many lessons from Steve One of them was about cancer diagnosis Of course at the NCI, nobody’s showing up with stage I, II, or III cancer By definition, every patient there is showing up with metastatic cancer, and they’ve progressed through all standard treatments These are people that have 6 months to live Maybe you can achieve a durable remission for 10% of them He said, “Look, cancer will do one of two things to a family. It will take a strong family and bring them much closer together, it will take a fractured family and blow them wide apart. As a doctor, as a nurse, as an anybody in the field of oncology, your ability to kind of be there for that family is as important, potentially more important, than it is in any other specialty of medicine.” [Steve was the guest in episode #177] Tell me a little bit about the state of oncology in the mid-eighties when you’re embarking on your medical oncology fellowship Help people understand what the world of cancer looked like roughly 40 years ago Breast cancer is a good example The common therapy that was used were very old, decades old: Cytoxan, Methotrexate, 5-FU There were no new chemotherapy drugs, and hadn’t been in a while The field was stifled; there wasn’t a lot going on Susan was really interested in cancer epidemiology Asking the question: Why did people get cancer and couldn’t we do something about it? In the second year of her fellowship, she wanted to study the relationship between Hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma To understand the viral link with cancer The mentor she was supposed to work with ended up not coming to San Francisco, so she decided to go to Berkeley and get a Master’s in Public Health She really scrambled because she didn’t want to waste a year What was the nature of the program? It was a 3-year fellowship with a research track on the side UCSF was a very academic place You could do 2 or 3 years, and many people went into the lab Susan didn’t want to go into the lab, she wanted to learn more about statistics and epidemiology She thought she wanted to be a cancer epidemiologist To this day, she still thinks that is one of the great opportunities to make a big impact, “I’m a pragmatist. The good news was that all that learning at Berkeley and at UCSF in epi and biostat I brought to drug development. Clinical trials have a lot in common with doing epidemiology.”‒ Susan Desmond-Hellmann You brought up Hep B and hepatocellular carcinoma, was it understood at the time what we know now? It was, yeah Palmer Beasley, one of the fathers of that relationship, was the guy who was supposed to come [to UCSF] There were preliminary papers, and something relatively early, but it was emerging science Do you recall what the incidence of Hep B was and Hep C back then? She doesn’t If you weren’t in Asia, she thinks it was relatively low But increasing, which is partly why the vaccines are so important Susan’s experience working on the frontlines of the HIV/AIDS crisis in Uganda [12:30] Tell me how you wound up in Uganda After she got her Master’s in Public Health, she became the oncologist at UCSF in the university hospital (Moffett) for the AIDS clinic San Francisco General had a very well-known program run by oncologists for AIDS patients who were in the safety net hospital In the university hospital, if you were very sick and you had Kaposi’s sarcoma, you saw Susan Susan had just gotten married, and her husband was also an intern He was in the lab, in ID, doing immunology work Two of the chiefs of medicine at UCSF were approached by The Rockefeller Foundation who had started to become worried about heterosexual transmission of HIV Remember Susan talked about the Haitians and the hemophiliacs and homosexuals? One H wasn’t heterosexual There was a lot of disbelief about African HIV Some people thought it must be gay sex, but people are too embarrassed to admit it There were other theories, but people just did not understand what was going on in Africa The Rockefeller Foundation gave UCSF a grant to study heterosexual transmission of HIV {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Ever experienced a headache from drinking red wine? Researchers may have identified a reason",
      "content": "While many of us enjoy a few alcoholic beverages with friends and family now and then, the consequences of overindulgence are famously unpleasant. Headache, nausea, fatigue, and general malaise are commonly experienced by over-imbibers and can be temporarily debilitating. The post-consumption headache is particularly common, but many find that not all sources of alcohol are equally likely to result in this symptom. Red wine, in particular, is notorious for inducing headaches and does so roughly 3-fold more frequently than other beverages,1 often within 30 minutes and after only a single glass. But what might explain such an effect? One study suggests that the polyphenol quercetin, a biologically active molecule present at relatively high concentrations in red wine, might be responsible.2 What causes alcohol-related headaches? Alcohol (or more precisely, ethanol, the type of alcohol present in alcoholic beverages) has direct effects on many physiological systems and is responsible for the “buzz” sensations people experience when drinking. However, the metabolism of alcohol involves production of an intermediate compound known as acetaldehyde, and it is the build up of acetaldehyde that appears to induce the unpleasant side effects of alcoholic beverages. Production of acetaldehyde is the first step in alcohol metabolism, after which this intermediate compound is further metabolized by the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) into harmless end-products. Slowing the rate of this second step can therefore lead to accumulation of acetaldehyde and the consequent headaches and other negative sensations associated with alcohol intake. Indeed, the strongest evidence of acetaldehydes’ culpability in the undesirable effects of alcohol overconsumption comes from studies of individuals with a genetic defect in the ALDH2 gene. Those with a homozygous ALDH2 defect demonstrate almost no ALDH2 activity, and subsequently experience greatly increased acetaldehyde levels following even moderate alcohol consumption.3 Similarly, suppression of ALDH2 by the drug disulfiram also leads to increased serum acetaldehyde. Importantly, the undesirable effects of alcohol consumption, including headache, are highly prevalent in both those with ALDH2 defects and those taking disulfiram.4 But some data5 suggest that ALDH2 activity may also be impaired by quercetin, a biologically active flavonoid compound found in high levels in red wine. Red wine contains roughly 10-100 times higher concentrations of quercetin than beer, white wine, or spirits,6 so if the suppression of ALDH2 by quercetin is sufficient to significantly raise serum acetaldehyde levels, this might easily explain why undesirable effects seem more pronounced with red wine relative to other sources of alcohol. Investigators Devi et al. thus sought to determine the magnitude of the specific effects of quercetin on ALDH2 activity. What they did This study was designed to assess the ability of quercetin and its metabolites to affect the activity of ALDH2. To accomplish this, the researchers utilized an in vitro biochemical assay in which quercetin or related compounds were added to a solution containing human ALDH2 enzyme, and enzyme inhibition was measured by spectroscopy. Quercetin at a concentration of 20 μM was found to inhibit ALDH2 by 28%, but in addition to this direct effect of quercetin itself, a major metabolite of quercetin — quercetin-3-glucuronide (Q3G) — caused an astounding ~78% inhibition of ALDH2. The IC-50 (the concentration of a substance required to reduce a biological process by half its maximal value) for quercetin and Q3G was calculated to be 26.5 μM and 9.6 μM, respectively. (For reference, the IC-50 of the ALDH2 inhibitor disulfiram was calculated to be 1.45 μM, indicating a stronger inhibitory effect by disulfiram than either quercetin or Q3G.) Based on reports that quercetin is present in red wine at a concentration of about 50 μM and that most quercetin that reaches circulation is converted to Q3G, the authors calculated that consumption of a 150-ml glass of red wine would lead to serum Q3G concentrations of approximately 5 μM (out of a total quercetin concentration of ~6 μM). Given the findings of their in vitro tests, they then estimated that this amount of Q3G would impair ALDH2 activity by ~37%. Interpreting these data Though this study was well executed, its results only go so far. The use of an in vitro model, in which reagents are simply added together in a test tube, certainly presents a limitation to extrapolating these data to humans. When humans consume quercetin-containing food or drink, it must first be absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and undergo first-pass metabolism by the liver before reaching circulation. What is the ultimate bioavailability of oral quercetin? The source (many vegetables and herbs contain quercetin, particularly capers, dill, fennel, and onions), presence of other macronutrients, and interindividual variation all appear to significantly impact absorption.7 Indeed, studies measuring serum quercetin levels after wine consumption have reported highly variable results, and although the 6 μM concentration estimated by Devi et al. does fall within reported ranges, it’s important to keep in mind that this was an estimate — they performed no in vivo experiments to actually measure the resulting quercetin concentrations. This brings us to another noteworthy caveat, which is that these experiments also did not attempt to determine the effect of 37% ALDH2 inhibition on acetaldehyde build-up — the key variable in assessing whether ALDH2 inhibition by quercetin might translate to noticeable differences in the negative symptoms of alcohol intake. (Again, this is weaker inhibition than is seen with disulfiram, which is known to have a very strong effect on alcohol-related side effects.) While it is possible that red wine consumption could increase serum quercetin metabolite concentrations high enough to significantly impact ALDH2 activity and therefore increase serum acetaldehyde to a level sufficient to induce a headache, Devi et al. demonstrate only one isolated link in this chain of events — albeit a critical one for which we had the least prior evidence. No study has yet attempted to simultaneously measure all of these variables, let alone in human subjects. Can you enjoy red wine but avoid the headache? Still, if we assume these results reflect a genuine, significant pathway underlying the dreaded “red wine headache,” does this mean that you can never enjoy a cabernet or merlot without pain? Not exactly, as various strategies exist for mitigating the headache-inducing effects. The simplest approaches are old standbys: drink less in total, make sure to consume plenty of water while drinking wine, and extend the consumption window to allow more time for acetaldehyde metabolism to occur and prevent it from building up in the blood. But wines also vary significantly in their quercetin content. White wines and rosés contain far less quercetin than reds, and even among reds, some varieties and vintages will have higher or lower levels than others. (In fact, some winemakers take intentional steps to reduce quercetin content through filtration and fining agents during the winemaking process, as quercetin tends to cause precipitates to form in wine.) Choosing a variety with a low level of quercetin may be advantageous, though this can be challenging since factors such as soil properties and sun exposure — which can change from year to year and aren’t generally disclosed on a bottle’s label — can have substantial impacts. Unfortunately, these mitigation strategies don’t apply universally. If you happen to carry two copies of a defective ALDH gene (common for those of East Asian descent) and experience symptoms after any alcohol consumption, it is unlikely any of these approaches will provide much relief. Further, if quercetin contributes to headaches with red wine, it may not be the only factor that does so. Some individuals find that at-home wine filters, which remove many sulfites and histamines but do not affect quercetin, help to prevent wine-related headaches, suggesting that these other molecules play a role in generating this particular symptom. Finally, we must emphasize that these strategies might prevent the short-term negative effects of alcohol, but, with the exception of reducing total intake, we have no evidence that they would reduce alcohol’s numerous long-term negative effects on health. The bottom line Devi et al. identified a plausible mechanism to explain the headache and hangover symptoms commonly experienced by red wine drinkers. A study using human subjects and simultaneously measuring the quercetin content of alcoholic beverages, serum acetaldehyde, serum quercetin content following consumption, and the presence and severity of headache and hangover symptoms would help confirm the proposed links between red wine and headaches, though there would still exist some possibility that quercetin is not the only culprit. In the meantime, those who wish to enjoy wine without the headache might try various mitigation strategies to lessen symptoms, but of course, the surest strategy — and the one that is best for long-term health, as well — is to reduce overall intake.

      "content": "Caffeine is woven so thoroughly throughout modern life that we rarely pause to consider its remarkable influence on human physiology and performance. From the morning coffee ritual to the pre-workout supplement, this molecule shapes our daily rhythms in ways both obvious and subtle. Yet despite its ubiquity — or perhaps because of it — many misconceptions persist about caffeine’s effects on health and performance. In this comprehensive review, we’ll examine the scientific evidence behind caffeine’s impact on the body and mind. Caffeine is widely consumed for its well-known acute effects on mental alertness and mood, its efficacy as an ergogenic aid, and its ability to stave off fatigue, but mounting evidence links caffeine to long-term effects on health, too. What role might this ubiquitous compound play in metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurological health? Are there risks associated with its use? Do certain individuals stand to reap greater benefits — or assume greater risks — with caffeine consumption? We’ll examine these questions and more as we explore caffeine’s broader implications for health and well-being and attempt to provide practical guidance on its use.",

Formal definition: an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage If you think of it as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience is usually tied to something physically happening, but it may not be ⇒ What’s missing in that definition, is that pain is the great motivator Pain is one of the most primitive experiences going back to single cell organisms It’s either pain or reward You’re either being driven towards oxygen, food, sex, or you’re trying to get away from danger Pain is so wonderful because it’s so terrible It keeps us alive Without pain, we would’ve never lived as a species We have these genetic issues of congenital insensitivity to pain Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience To understand pain, whether you’re a Martian or you’re a human now, you have to look back in history Rene Descartes, 17th century French philosopher, thought to be the father of modern philosophy Incredible contributions: he brought Cartesian geometry to us, which led to calculus, and he had this dualistic model of pain that he put forward To his credit, it was the first mechanistic foundation for pain because beforehand pain was thought to be something mystical or religious It was punishment of the gods His framework is often illustrated with this famous picture [shown below] of a little boy with his foot in the fire And there’s a little string from his foot going up into his brain, and it ends up in the pineal gland, which was thought to be uniquely a human area The idea is the fire pulls on the little string, opens up pores, and the pineal gland rings a bell and the boy withdraws his foot Figure 1. Line drawing of the pain system by Louis La Forge based on Descartes’ description in treatise of Man. Image credit: Journal of Neurophysiology 2013 The idea is in this dualistic model, there is a complete separation between body and mind The body is where pain is generated The mind is where it’s perceived, but the mind is simply a passive receptacle receiving these signals That model put forward in the 17th century stuck with us for hundreds and hundreds of years, and today it has influenced medical care It has influenced policy It’s influenced everything in our society about the way we think about pain This dualistic model is utterly completely wrong Yes, Descartes got Cartesian geometry right, but he complete bollocks screwed it up when it came to pain It’s only been in the last number of decades that we’ve appreciated the nuance of what pain really is Sean explains about pain, “Instead of it being under this guise of this separate mind and body, we now appreciate it as this integrated biopsychosocial phenomenon meaning that, and I think this is one of the most important things that I’d like to drive across.” ⇒ Nociception is a term referring to electrochemical injury signals that occur in the periphery, that what goes on in the body and what goes on in the brain, the experience of pain, they may have nothing to do with each other or very little linkages (and Sean’s going to unpack that) For hundreds of years, we’re basing our understanding of pain on Rene Descartes’ dualistic model We still see this in medical care right now For many, many, years, when Sean talked with the surgeons, they were firmly of the opinion that the amount of pain that a patient had after surgery was related to how much the scalpel cut and how much tissue damage was done It’s only more in the last 20 or so years that he’s seeing surgeons really embracing this model that what people bring to the operating room table directly influences how much pain they have Their early life experiences, all this stuff that Sean will talk about The latter part of the 19th century brought a couple of other tools to pain Local anesthetics (from cocaine down to lidocaine) General anesthetics (ether) ‒ allowed surgeons to cut people without having to hold them down while they screamed These didn’t shed any new light on understanding pain They were viewed as a blunting instrument; it didn’t change the model This has had tragic consequences in the care of people, particularly with chronic pain Particularly women with chronic pain who have felt stigmatized, invalidated because absent something that’s obviously wrong out in the body of the periphery, they were just labeled as being histrionic housewives or being told it’s all in their head Not just women, but also some men as well That has gotten better with the evolution of our perception or our model into a biopsychosocial model The biological mechanisms behind how we perceive pain [9:30] Is there a pain receptor? Nociceptors are basically a transducer It’s a complicated name If you have an engineering background, you’ll all know that a transducer is simply a device that converts one form of energy into another form of energy This microphone is converting sound energy into electrical energy The speakers convert electrical energy back into sound energy We have these nociceptors that lie in our skin, our soft tissues, our deep tissues, our viscera, and they’re specialized, and they convert different forms of energy into electrochemical impulses They take pressure; they take heat, cold; they take chemical changes in the form of pH (that can occur during infection) {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Expanding the toolkit for managing acute pain",
      "content": "Despite affecting millions of people daily, pain remains a challenging condition to treat effectively and safely. The landscape of pain management has remained largely unchanged for decades, dominated by three primary players: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and opioids. While these medications have helped countless patients manage acute and chronic pain, each comes with significant and well-documented limitations and risks, signaling a pressing need for alternatives. Fortunately, recent developments have given reason for new hope on this front. In a milestone for pain medicine, the FDA approved suzetrigine (brand name: Journavx), the first new class of analgesic drugs in over 20 years and an important step forward in expanding our pain management toolkit. Concerns with traditional pain medications Our current standard approaches each come with significant drawbacks. NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) work well for mild to moderate pain but often prove insufficient for more severe cases. Moreover, their mechanism of action — suppressing inflammation — may impede healing in some contexts, as inflammation is a crucial part of the repair process. NSAIDs also carry risks of gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular complications, particularly with prolonged use. Acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol) offers a different mechanism of action but similarly falls short for moderate to severe pain. While generally safe when used as directed, its narrow therapeutic window means that exceeding recommended doses can quickly lead to liver toxicity. Opioids remain our most potent tools for managing severe pain, but their effectiveness comes at a steep price. Beyond common side effects like constipation and respiratory depression, their potential for dependence and addiction has contributed significantly to the ongoing opioid crisis. Why is pain so difficult to target? The 20-year drought in new pain medications isn’t for lack of trying, yet developing effective analgesics has proven remarkably challenging. This reflects several fundamental difficulties in targeting pain. As Dr. Sean Mackey explains in a new episode of The Drive, pain isn’t a single entity but rather a complex experience involving multiple biological systems. It can arise from tissue damage, nerve injury, inflammation, or combinations thereof. This complexity makes it difficult to identify specific molecular targets that might provide relief without disrupting other essential functions. Pain is also inherently subjective, making it challenging to measure consistently in clinical trials. What one person describes as severe pain might be moderate to another, complicating the assessment of new treatments. Even when seemingly promising targets are identified, developing effective drugs against them often proves difficult. For example, the sodium channel NaV1.7 has long been implicated in the generation of pain, as nerve fibers that mediate pain rely on sodium dynamics to transduce pain signals. However, although NaV1.7 itself is specific to pain-sensing nerve fibers, it bears a high degree of genetic similarity to other members of the larger family of sodium channels (which are critical for nerve and muscle function more broadly), and as a result, it has been difficult to target pharmacologically with high specificity.1 Suzetrigine’s success Given such an uphill battle in developing pain management strategies, Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ success with suzetrigine represents a significant achievement. The drug works by blocking NaV1.8, another sodium channel specific to pain-sensing nerves. However, because NaV1.8 is not as similar to other sodium channels at NaV1.7, honing in on NaV1.8 is less likely to have detrimental off-target consequences. The efficacy of suzetrigine was demonstrated in phase 3 clinical trials focusing on post-surgical pain following abdominoplasty and bunionectomy procedures.2 High-dose suzetrigine showed significant improvements in pain scores compared to placebo. For abdominoplasty, the least squares mean difference in SPID48 (Sum of Pain Intensity Differences over 48 hours) between suzetrigine and placebo was 48.4 (95% CI: 33.6, 63.1; P<0.0001) for abdominoplasty and 29.3 (95% CI: 14.0, 44.6; P=0.0002) for bunionectomy — both clinically meaningful results that suggest real benefit for patients. However, when compared to hydrocodone-acetaminophen (brand name: Vicodin; a combination of a mild opioid and acetaminophen), suzetrigine performed similarly but not better. As this was tested in a post-surgical setting, both placebo and suzetrigine had high incidence of adverse events reported (50.0% for suzetrigine and 56.3% for placebo), most commonly nausea, constipation, headache, dizziness, and hypotension. However, adverse reactions specific to suzetrigine were infrequent and included itchiness (2.1%), muscle spasms (1.3%), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (1.1%), and rash (1.1%).3 Where do we stand now? While the approval of suzetrigine represents progress, several important limitations should be noted. The primary trials focused on relatively minor surgical procedures that typically don’t require intensive pain management. We don’t yet know how effective suzetrigine might be for more severe post-surgical pain. Likewise, the trials used Vicodin as the active comparator, not stronger opioids like oxycodone or morphine, leaving questions about suzetrigine’s relative efficacy in managing more severe pain. Reflecting these limitations in testing to date, suzetrigine is currently only approved for moderate to severe acute pain – and, at $15.50 per 50mg pill, it is significantly more expensive than existing options for this purpose, which may limit access and adoption. However, its utility for chronic pain conditions remains an area of ongoing investigation. Despite the limitations, suzetrigine’s approval carries several important implications. It provides clinicians with another tool for managing acute pain, potentially reducing reliance on opioids in some cases. Because suzetrigine acts primarily on peripheral nerves, it appears to lack the addiction potential of opioids, though long-term safety data are still to come. Further, the successful development of an NaV1.8 blocker may encourage further research into similar mechanisms, potentially leading to improved versions or related compounds — just as the GLP-1 receptor agonists and statins of today are huge improvements over their first-generation relatives. Indeed, numerous other NaV1.8-targeting drugs, along with some targeting the closely related NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 channels, are in the pipeline. A new player in pain management The approval of suzetrigine marks an important milestone in pain management — the first new analgesic drug class in over two decades. While it’s likely not the revolutionary opioid replacement we might have hoped for, it represents meaningful progress in expanding our pain management options. Its development also demonstrates that novel analgesic mechanisms can be successfully targeted, potentially paving the way for future innovations. For clinicians, suzetrigine offers a new option for managing moderate to severe acute pain, particularly in cases where opioid avoidance is desirable. However, the high cost and limited evidence base mean this drug is likely to serve as a complementary tool rather than as a replacement for existing analgesics. The journey to better pain management continues, but the FDA approval of a new class of pain medicine is a step in the right direction.

The discussion is prompted by a significant increase in nicotine use compared to when Peter and Nick first addressed it in an AMA about four years ago. Key Themes of the Episode Nicotine Use Today: Increased popularity and broader public use since the original AMA on the subject. Growing curiosity about nicotine’s potential short-term and long-term benefits. Topics to Be Covered: Benefits of Nicotine: Focus on areas like cognition and exercise performance. Risks of Nicotine: Health risks and potential side effects users should be aware of. Forms of Nicotine Use: Different vehicles and methods of delivery (e.g., patches, pouches, gum, vaping, cigarettes). Comparison of pros and cons of each. Smoking Cessation Segment Discuss smoking cessation strategies. Offer advice on how to help loved ones quit or approach the conversation with them. The current landscape of nicotine research [4:45] State of Nicotine Research – Then vs. Now Historical Context of Nicotine Research Most research on nicotine has historically been tied to tobacco, particularly its use in cigarettes. This linkage complicates understanding the independent effects of nicotine, because: Tobacco products include many harmful compounds beyond nicotine. It’s difficult to isolate nicotine’s effects from those of tobacco smoke or other tobacco-derived components. Natural vs. Synthetic Nicotine A growing distinction in current research and public discourse is between: Tobacco-derived nicotine (even in non-combustible forms like pouches). Synthetic nicotine, which is produced without any use of the tobacco plant. This distinction is relevant because: Synthetic nicotine may carry fewer contaminants. It could allow researchers to study nicotine in isolation more accurately. Challenges in Isolating Nicotine’s Impact Many perceived or observed health effects (e.g., infertility) are well-documented in smokers, but not well studied in users of: Vapes Nicotine pouches Other non-combustible or synthetic products This limits our ability to draw firm conclusions about nicotine itself, apart from tobacco. Contrast With the Prior AMA Peter notes that this episode will differ from the prior nicotine AMA in key ways: The previous discussion focused more on biological mechanisms (e.g., how nicotine acts on receptors). This episode will address more practical questions, like risks, benefits, usage methods, and cessation strategies. There’s more research now on potential benefits of nicotine than there was four years ago, and those findings will also be explored. {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to this entire podcast episode, its extensive show notes, and more premium content?

      "title": "Erectile dysfunction as an indicator of cardiovascular health",
      "content": "Despite widespread prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED), a disproportionately low number of individuals seek medical help for the condition. Many are held back by the stigma surrounding sexual health discussions, and the issue is compounded by the common perception that ED is a distressing, though isolated, personal issue with ramifications confined to the bedroom. However, this viewpoint significantly underestimates the broader health implications that ED can signal. Indeed, ED should not be viewed solely as a concern of sexual or reproductive health. In particular, the medical community has long recognized an association between erectile function and cardiovascular (CV) health, which has been supported by decades of research. And yet, despite the strong correlation, there remains a glaring gap in public awareness and understanding of what ED can actually signify about systemic vascular issues and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). So what’s the link? ​​Mechanisms linking ED and CVD ED and CVD are intricately intertwined, and central to this relationship is the endothelium, a single layer of cells lining our blood vessels. The endothelium is fundamental to vascular health, as it controls the dilation of blood vessels through production of nitric oxide (NO). NO acts as a key signaling agent for blood vessels to relax and expand, thus increasing blood flow, a process critical to both cardiac function and the mechanics of achieving an erection. However, in states like ED and CVD, the production and availability of nitric oxide are often compromised. This is exacerbated by periods of elevated oxidative stress (caused by aging, chronic disease, chronic stress, etc.). When nitric oxide levels are suboptimal, endothelial dysfunction can arise, leading to restricted blood flow and compromised erectile function, as well as kick-starting or worsening the process of atherosclerosis. ED and CVD are also linked in their mutual tendency to be aggravated by chronic low-grade inflammation. Elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers are common to both conditions, fostering further damage to the endothelium and accelerating atherogenesis. This explains in part why ED and CVD share many risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking, and clues us in to why these conditions may co-present so often. And yet, ED does not merely co-occur in many instances with CVD — it frequently precedes overt cardiovascular symptoms due to the smaller diameter of penile arteries compared to coronary arteries. (Indeed, as we’ve often pointed out in the past, cardiovascular disease itself often has no symptoms at all until the occurrence of a potentially fatal event such as a heart attack or stroke.) This implies that ED could often be one of the first signs of systemic vascular disease, acting as an early warning rather than merely a concurrent symptom. Recognizing this temporal relationship shifts the perception of ED from an isolated concern to a significant indicator of endothelial health, accentuating its clinical importance and its potential as an early diagnostic tool for assessing ASCVD risk. (That said, it’s important to note that ED is neither a cause nor a direct consequence of ASCVD, but rather that these represent two distinct manifestations of the same underlying pathology.) How good of an indicator is ED for cardiovascular disease? Just how strong is ED as an indicator of ASCVD? The relationship between the two conditions has been substantiated by a breadth of research, including a landmark study from 2005 that examined data from 9,457 men (aged 55+) who participated in the control arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (conducted from 1994-2003).1 Individuals with ED or CVD at baseline were excluded, resulting in a final cohort of 4,247 men. Over a nine-year period, these men were assessed for both ED and CVD every three months. Statistical adjustments were made for various confounding variables such as age, body mass index, blood pressure, serum lipids, and lifestyle factors. The findings revealed that 57% of participants (2,420 individuals) developed ED within five years and 65% by the seven-year mark. Adjusted models from the study indicated that incident ED was associated with 25% increased risk for any cardiovascular event (hazard ratio (HR) of 1.25; 95% CI: 1.02–1.53; P=0.04). Among specific CV events, the greatest statistically significant increase in risk was observed for angina (HR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.03–2.28; P=0.04), though associations for strokes and heart attacks neared significance, with HRs of 1.70 (95% CI: 0.98–2.96; P=0.06) and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.96–1.74; P=0.10), respectively. When including participants with baseline ED (doubling the sample size), the risk increases were even greater, especially for transient ischemic attack (stroke-like symptoms that resolve within 24h, caused by short-term reduction in blood flow to the brain), which demonstrated an HR of 1.92 (95% CI, 1.12–3.26; P=0.02). The adjusted HR for any CV event in this larger cohort was 1.45 (95% CI, 1.25–1.69; P<0.001). Ultimately, the risk of a new cardiovascular event was 0.015 per person-year for men without initial ED, compared to 0.024 per person-year among those with initial ED. This means that for every 100 men who had ED at the start of the study, about 2.4 new cardiovascular events would be expected to occur each year. These findings were reinforced by a 2013 meta-analysis of longitudinal studies involving 92,757 participants across an average follow-up of 6.1 years.2 This study also revealed significant positive associations between ED and risk of cardiovascular events on par with those seen in the 2005 study. Moreover, the authors reported that symptoms of ED typically appeared two to five years before the onset of cardiovascular symptoms, with more severe ED correlating with a greater atherosclerotic burden and increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). These studies underscore ED’s potential as a marker of CV risk, suggesting that it can be utilized in clinical settings as an early warning sign for impending cardiovascular issues. Not only does this broaden the scope of cardiovascular risk assessment, but it also emphasizes the importance of integrating ED evaluation into routine health checks for men, offering a crucial opportunity for early intervention and management of both sexual and cardiovascular health. The impact of management A question naturally follows: can treating ED also prevent or slow ASCVD progression? Emerging evidence suggests that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (e.g., tadalafil, sildenafil) — foundational in the management of ED — may also play a role in mitigating CVD progression. For example, a recent longitudinal study of 509,788 men demonstrated that those who were treated with tadalafil for urogenital issues (including ED) showed a 34% decrease in risk of all-cause mortality, a 27% decrease in risk of heart attack, and a 34% decrease in risk of stroke relative to those who did not take medication.3 (Benefits were also seen in separate analyses for sildenafil, though the effect was slightly attenuated.) As noted previously, the underlying mechanisms appear to be linked to improvements in endothelial function — a crucial aspect in the genesis of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular complications. Both ED and CV health also often improve with the same lifestyle modifications — such as diet, physical activity, weight management, and smoking cessation — and indeed, such measures are recommended for ED by the American Urological Association.4 This is supported by evidence that such lifestyle changes can improve endothelial function, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance nitric oxide production, which are critical for both maladies.5,6 Don’t ignore ED Despite the well-established link between ED and cardiovascular risk, awareness of this connection among the public has been limited. Though authoritative bodies such as the American College of Cardiology point to the need for cardiovascular risk evaluation as an essential component of ED management, clinicians can only utilize ED as an early indicator of CV risk when patients choose to seek medical attention for erectile issues in the first place. Seeking help provides a critical opportunity to detect CVD relatively early and intervene to slow its progression, in addition to offering a chance to improve quality of life and resolve the mental health issues that often accompany ED. So although the clinical community has long recognized the links between ED and CVD, it’s time we rise to the challenge of ensuring that message is heard loud and clear by patients, too: erectile dysfunction is not merely a sexual health concern but is a pivotal canary in the coalmine for overall vascular health — and accordingly, it should be treated with the seriousness and medical attention it deserves.

Show Notes How radiation oncology became a distinct, rapidly evolving medical specialty [2:45] This is the first time Peter and Sanjay are together not driving Peter is resisting the urge to talk about cars (until the end) Sanjay might be one of the most knowledgeable human beings on cars and the founder of MD Motörheads (Facebook group of doctors who are gear heads) He’s always the bad on to have on the shoulder when you’re contemplating a new set of wheels or a new something for your car Sanjay is a radiation oncologist The bread and butter of what Sanjay does as a radiation oncologist is a black box to many people (Peter included) Peter has much more familiarity with the medical side of oncology than the radiation side It would be wonderful to understand more as that field has evolved a lot in the last 25 years It’s one of the youngest fields It’s not steeped in some of the traditions that surgery and medicine are It’s rapidly evolving and the technology has changed so much in the last decade or two When did radiation oncology become its own discipline, with its own set of boards and everything like that? As a kid growing up in Houston, some of Sanjay’s friends were radiologists As an elementary school kid, he remembers CT scanning was pretty new in the 80s In the 70s and prior to that, it was just a fellowship Radiologists would have a cobalt-60 machine that they would train on for a few weeks and you’d do a few easy calculations and do some crude treatments Radiation oncology really came into its own starting in the 70s and more into the 80s The ACR had a separate carve out Radiation oncology residency training is completely independent of diagnostics now It’s an intern year followed by 4 years of radiation oncology There’s just a little bit of overlap with diagnostics, but not a lot of diagnostic training just because there’s so much to do on the therapeutic side Defining radiation, ionizing vs. non-ionizing, and common misconceptions about radiation exposure [5:30] The idea of using low-dose radiation to heal injuries A lot of people are going to be very interested in this idea And why aren’t we using low-dose radiation more to heal some of these nagging orthopedic injuries that people have? What radiation is We can’t have that discussion without giving people some understanding of what radiation is Peter wants to do it in a way that’s both rigorous enough that we can really get into some of the science of this But also get into it gently enough that people that maybe don’t remember high school physics well enough can come along for the ride and not get lost ⇒Radiation itself, the term itself has got a bit of a negative connotation, but basically it’s part of the electromagnetic spectrum Figure 1. The electromagnetic spectrum. Image credit: NASA at Wikipedia We have everything in the range of increasing energy of photons, which are just particles of light On the one end you have radio waves and microwaves, and the other end you’ve got ultraviolet And then you get into X-rays and radio waves In the middle of all that is the visible spectrum (you’ve got the rainbow, red, green, blue that we can see) The human eye can only perceive a tiny little narrow spectrum These are actually wavelengths and energies, which are the very low end energies Both radio waves and microwaves are what they call non-ionizing Discussed in previous podcasts with Attariwala from Prenuvo [episode #61] Figure 2. Types of electromagnetic radiation: non-ionizing versus ionizing radiation. Image credit: Spazturtle at Wikipedia ⇒ The bottom line is that the low energy stuff is non-ionizing and that cannot damage tissue That goes all the way up to visible light Then when you start going to the higher energy X-rays, that’s when you get both X-rays as well as ultraviolet light and then the higher particle stuff {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "An emerging role for creatine supplementation in the treatment of depression",
      "content": "Despite the existence of an arsenal of medications that target the neurotransmitters in the brain thought to be responsible for mood disorders, about 30% of individuals with major depressive disorder remain treatment-resistant. This points to other possible factors that may contribute to the condition. Research to date has implicated impaired energy metabolism as a potential culprit, as the brain requires enormous amounts of energy to function normally. This, in turn, would suggest that interventions known to boost cellular energy production might offer some relief for those suffering from depression, and attention has turned to one such supplement in particular: creatine. Well known for its role in muscular energetics, might creatine have additional benefits in the treatment of depression? Why creatine? Most conventional antidepressants are based on the “monoamine hypothesis,” which posits that depression results from a depletion of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine. Many antidepressants, including SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), therefore aim to increase the availability of these neurotransmitters. But in order to produce neurotransmitters and allow them to function properly in driving neural responses, the brain requires energy. The brain is an especially energy-intensive organ, consuming approximately 20% of the body’s energy despite making up only about 2% of body weight. Given this, disruptions in brain energy balance (or, “bioenergetics”) may influence monoamine function, and thus, deficits in brain bioenergetics may underlie or contribute to mood disorders, including depression.1 Creatine, widely known for its role in muscle energy metabolism, plays a critical role in maintaining brain energy homeostasis. It serves as both an energy buffer — storing cellular energy in the form of high-energy chemical bonds as phosphocreatine — and an energy shuttle, transporting energy produced by mitochondria to areas of high demand within neurons, such as synapses. With creatine’s ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, increases in brain creatine reserves could thus theoretically improve brain bioenergetics and may act synergistically with monoamine-based treatments (like SSRIs). Indeed, growing evidence suggests that combining creatine with SSRIs may improve treatment outcomes. In one proof-of-concept study in women with major depressive disorder, adding 5 g of creatine daily to escitalopram (an SSRI marketed under the brand name Lexapro) led to faster and more substantial symptom relief than escitalopram alone.2,3 Small, unblinded studies have likewise shown promising reductions in depression scores when other SSRIs and SNRIs were paired with creatine.4,5 Animal research further underscores this synergy, revealing that blocking serotonin synthesis reduces creatine’s antidepressant-like effects, indicating that the benefits of creatine for depression are at least partially mediated by its effect of enhancing neurotransmitter production and function.6,7 Human studies, however, have predominantly focused on the combination of creatine with SSRIs, whereas many other antidepressant treatments — both pharmacological and non-pharmacological — are also commonly used by those with major depressive disorder. For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a frontline treatment focused on addressing the negative thought patterns that fuel depression, providing tools to reframe thinking and develop healthier coping strategies. So this leaves us with a key question: does creatine have potential utility as an adjuvant therapy with CBT? A recent study sought to answer this question.8 An emerging role for creatine with behavioral therapy For this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, authors Sherpa et al. examined 100 participants in India with clinical diagnoses of depression. Participants (mean age 30.4 ±7.4 years, 50% female) were randomized to either CBT plus creatine (5 g/day) or CBT plus placebo for a treatment period of 8 weeks.8 The CBT protocol for both groups involved a total of five 45-min CBT sessions (one every other week), and the primary outcome — improvement in symptom severity — was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a standard method for evaluating depressive symptoms. Scores on the PHQ-9 can range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating more severe depression (mild depression: scores of 5–9, moderate: 10–14, moderate-severe: 15–19, and severe: ≥20). Results indicated that both groups improved significantly in symptom severity from baseline to the 8-week timepoint. However, the creatine group showed statistically significantly greater improvements, with scores dropping an additional 5.12 points compared to placebo (95% CI: −7.20 to −3.52). Specifically, the CBT-creatine group moved from moderately severe depression (17.8±6.1) to mild depression (5.8±4.8), while the CBT-placebo group remained in the moderate range (shifting from 17.6±6.4 to 11.9±6.6). Additionally, twelve participants in the CBT-creatine group achieved remission (PHQ-9 score <5) compared with five in the CBT-placebo group. While these findings represent the intention-to-treat cohort (i.e., all participants who started treatment, regardless if they completed the entire treatment protocol), dropout rates were high among both groups (around 40%). This certainly may have impacted results, as those who dropped out may have been experiencing less benefit from either treatment. Indeed, the authors also conducted per-protocol analyses (i.e., excluding drop-outs) and reported a slightly greater difference between groups (the mean improvement in the CBT-creatine group exceeded that of the CBT-placebo group by 6.07 points, 95% CI: −7.88 to −4.25). However, an important limitation of this study is that it lacked any comparison to traditional pharmacological antidepressants, and thus, we are restricted in our ability to fully understand the scale of this effect. A difference of five points on the PHQ-9 scale is unequivocally clinically significant, so these new data from Sherpa et al. suggest that creatine can indeed improve outcomes from CBT compared to placebo (though it’s worth noting that the CBT protocol employed here was very light compared to more typical weekly or twice-weekly sessions). Further, according to a meta-analysis including over 50,000 patients, CBT is often just as effective as pharmacological therapies, and individuals who combine medications with CBT fare better than with either treatment alone,9 but is the combination of creatine and CBT as effective as a combination of SSRIs and CBT? If so, this opens new avenues for patients who do not respond to SSRIs or do not tolerate their side effects to achieve comparable relief as others achieve on traditional medications. Perhaps creatine added to both CBT and antidepressants would show still greater benefit, offering hope to those with the most severe forms of depression. We currently have no direct comparisons to answer these questions, so further clinical studies are warranted. The broader implications The anti-depressive potential of creatine is appealing for several practical reasons. Creatine monohydrate is inexpensive, widely available, and well-studied for safety, with established benefits for muscle function and exercise performance. Its potential role in treating depression adds a layer of accessibility for individuals who are seeking adjuncts to traditional antidepressants. Since many people already use creatine as part of their supplement routine, it could be an easy addition for those looking to improve mental health without major lifestyle changes. It may also serve as a low-cost option for those with limited resources, though evidence to date has only explored the effects of creatine supplementation for depression in combination with another first-line treatment (i.e., CBT and antidepressants). Thus, at present, creatine should not be considered a replacement for standard care. For those wishing to start taking creatine, the most common form used for supplementation is creatine monohydrate powder, typically at a dose of ~5 g/day (also the most common dose in studies on creatine and depression). Mild gastrointestinal upset and water retention (bloating) are among the most commonly reported side effects, but serious complications are rare in healthy adults. Nevertheless, individuals with kidney issues or bipolar disorder should consult a healthcare provider before starting creatine, as they may be at higher risk of adverse effects. The bottom line Creatine’s low risk-to-benefit ratio makes it an intriguing option to consider alongside standard treatments for depression, such as SSRIs or CBT. Already readily available as a muscle-boosting supplement, it may be an easy addition to mental health interventions under proper medical guidance. However, it’s crucial to maintain realistic expectations. While evidence so far is positive, it remains largely preliminary, and what works in small, specialized studies may not hold true for everyone. A central question for future research is whether creatine’s synergistic effect with antidepressants and CBT could become even more robust in a “triple combination” approach, as well as how it might affect other mood and anxiety disorders. As larger, more diverse studies come to light, we’ll gain clearer insights into how creatine might fit into the broader landscape of depression therapies. All in all, creatine offers a potentially valuable tool in the ongoing effort to find more effective, personalized ways to manage depression. Time — and more rigorous research — will tell exactly where it belongs in the therapeutic toolbox.

Show Notes Peter’s definition of longevity [2:30] Olivia is with her dad Peter and are here to talk about longevity Over the summer Olivia volunteered at a senior living center called Querencia During that time she met Sally who was very interested in Peter’s work Sally couldn’t join this episode because she’s sick, so this episode will be a conversation between Olivia and Peter for an audience at Querencia followed by their questions The word longevity means different things to different people. When you talk about longevity, how are you defining it? Definitely not living forever, although understandingly that’s what some people think of when they think of longevity Peter is talking about it in terms of 2 things: lifespan and healthspan The lifespan part is how long you live This is what most people think of The healthspan part is how well you live Both of these are of equal importance, and an extreme of one without the other is not ideal Nobody is saying, “I’d love to live to 100, but I want to spend the last 20 of those years unable to move.” Similarly no one would think it’s ideal to live an amazing, healthy live, but having that life cut short prematurely at 50 “When I think of longevity, what I’m really thinking about is maximizing both the length of life and the quality of life.”‒ Peter Attia Quality could further be broken down into a physical piece Am I free of pain most of the time? Am I able to physically do the things I enjoy doing? That could range from just the activities of daily living and self-care to recreational activities If you like to garden, how long do you want to be able to do that? If you play golf, if you like to go for walks and hikes or swim Then there’s a cognitive piece Peter doesn’t think anybody would fully expect that his brain (at his age) is as sharp as Olivia’s is, but he still wants to believe that his mind is pretty sharp We all want that for as long as possible The final piece is an emotional piece That deals with happiness, sense of purpose, connection to others You can imagine a scenario where somebody has perfect physical healthspan, meaning they can do anything they want to do physically, their brain is sharp, but they have no friends and no relationships We would all agree that that’s not really an ideal life Nobody would aspire to that When you put all those things together, that’s what longevity is Why it’s never too late to invest in your longevity [5:30] If some people here are wondering, is it too late to start caring about longevity and living longer, what would you say to them? That is not the case On the one hand, the earlier a person begins to take steps to increase their longevity, the more opportunity they have It’s like investing When is the best time to start saving for retirement? Probably the minute you start earning your first paycheck in your teens or 20s But does that mean you shouldn’t save money when you’re older? No, it doesn’t What the data say Data from clinical trials that are done with seniors that demonstrate for example: people who have never lifted weights in their life before, who start lifting weights for the first time when they’re in their 60s and 70s, have a remarkable benefit This is not just true of weight training; it’s true of any sort of exercise The short answer is no, it’s never too late to really start thinking about this, but obviously the best time to plant the tree is yesterday, if not today Olivia asks, “Why do they have a benefit if they haven’t done it before?” There’s an effect of training Specifically thinking of exercise, the body is really a “use-it-or-lose-it” organ (or collection of organs) And the muscles are a great example of that It’s actually true of young people and old people ⇒ The greatest effect of exercise is generally seen in the person who goes from being completely sedentary to even a mild amount of training If you look at somebody who exercises all the time ‒ if they added 3 hours a week to their training, it wouldn’t have an enormous impact Like Peter or Olivia If you took an individual who did zero exercise, and you took them to 3 hours a week, the impact is enormous Let’s be honest, 30 minutes a day, 6 days a week, is not a huge ask The importance of adding “life to years” rather than just “years to life” [7:45] Can you talk about the importance of adding life to years rather than just years to life and what that means to you? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "New dietary guidelines aim to optimize public health, not personal health",
      "content": "Every five years, the USDA revises its set of “Dietary Guidelines for Americans.” Often, these updates go largely unnoticed, barely receiving even the briefest mention in news outlets. But in the past few months, the release of the scientific report that will inform new guidelines for 2025-2030 attracted an unusual level of public attention thanks to one particular change from previous editions — namely, the addition of a recommendation to decrease consumption of animal-derived proteins (including meat, poultry, and eggs) in favor of plant-based protein sources like beans, peas, and lentils.1 What’s changed? This isn’t the first time meat has come under fire with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). Starting in 2015, the guidelines have recommended limiting intake of red and processed meats, and reduced consumption of saturated fats (which are primarily found in animal products such as meats and dairy) has been a part of the DGA since 1980. Past versions of the DGA have also highlighted beans, peas, and lentils as possible sources of plant-based protein, along with nuts, seeds, and soy products.2 So what makes the new version so different? One key update is in the scope of the DGA’s recommendations for limiting consumption of animal proteins. While previous guidelines have restricted this advice to red and processed meats, the 2025-2030 report recommends cutting back on meat in general (with the exception of seafood), as well as limiting consumption of eggs. This marks a significant deviation from earlier versions, which had supported lean meat options such as chicken breasts and ground turkey. In addition to this expanded denunciation of animal-derived proteins, another important change in the new guidelines relates to the prioritization of beans, peas, and lentils as primary protein sources, rather than as supplemental or alternative options. To this end, the report recommends that beans, peas, and lentils be reassigned from the “vegetable foods group” to the “protein foods group” and that they be listed as first protein options — followed by nuts, seeds, and soy products, then by seafood, and finally by meats, poultry, and eggs as last options. Where did the changes come from? Updates to the DGA don’t come out of nowhere. An advisory committee of nutrition experts is responsible for analyzing up-to-date research in order to form a scientific report that serves as the foundation for any changes to guidelines. The committee tends to be relatively conservative, only adding to or altering previous recommendations when a mountain of evidence seems to support the change (for example, the committee did not introduce the recommendation to reduce consumption of added sugars until its 2015-2020 revision3). So how strong is the evidence that motivated the new recommendation against meat consumption? At a surface level, it might seem fairly compelling. Many observational studies — often with impressively large cohort sizes — have reported correlations between animal protein consumption and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, and a host of other maladies. Likewise, several studies have reported inverse associations between adherence to a plant-based diet and risk of mortality or various health problems. A closer look However, once we dig a little deeper, this body of “evidence” starts to fall apart as quickly as a house of cards. We’ve discussed the many shortcomings of studies on plant and animal protein — and why they fail to show what they claim to show — ad nauseam over the years (see here, here, and here as just a few examples). But as a brief recap, a fundamental problem with the vast majority of evidence condemning animal protein is that it derives from observational data that are rife with confounds related to the overall health of participants. Health is one of the top motivations for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet in the United States,4 and it is highly likely that an individual who cares about their health enough to commit to this sort of dietary restriction likewise cares about their health enough to engage in other health-promoting behaviors like exercise, prioritization of sleep, and avoidance of smoking. By contrast, many people who eat a lot of meat do so despite popular perception (however misguided) that it is detrimental to health, and we can assume these individuals are more likely to similarly ignore other health advice. Thus, a pattern emerges: people who eat less meat are, on average, healthier than people who eat more meat for reasons other than their dietary habits, and therefore, people who eat less meat are less likely to develop or die from chronic health conditions independently of their decision to eschew animal proteins. This pattern shows up in observational data as a correlation between meat consumption and disease, though the true causal relationship is with other dietary and non-dietary variables. Of note, a few randomized trials (which avoid the confounds that plague observational studies) have reported health benefits of cutting meat out of participants’ diets. However, many of these come with their own considerable flaws, such as discrepancies in total calorie intake between groups. Indeed, several overarching systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials on this subject have reported no negative impact of meat consumption (or positive impact of avoiding meat consumption) on risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or other conditions commonly associated with meat-heavy diets.5,6 Optimizing public versus personal health Does all of the above mean that the advisory committee got it wrong in their recommendations for updates to the DGA? That depends on how you interpret the purpose for dietary guidelines in the first place. Federal guidelines on nutrition are intended to promote health and fitness at the national population level, largely as a means of reducing the burden on the healthcare system. The best way to accomplish this goal is to raise the health of those on the lower end of the population’s health spectrum, as these are the individuals who have the greatest room for improvement by relatively simple measures and are also those who would otherwise incur the vast majority of medical costs. And for individuals who lack the time or interest for gaining a detailed understanding of nutrition’s effects on health, a short set of simple, clear guidelines — such as “replace meat with beans and peas” — has a better chance of making an impact than an exhaustive description of nuances and exceptions — such as “limit highly processed foods, including processed meats, and avoid getting your meat from fast food joints, where you’re more likely to pair meat with empty calories from fries or soda…. Also, prioritize lean meat sources with high amounts of essential amino acids, but be careful about how you prepare it so you’re not loading up on additional fats and salt, and make sure that in addition to meat, you’re getting plenty of vegetables and fiber.” Thus, when it comes to the goal of optimizing public health, the present updates to past dietary guidelines make sense. But these updates become problematic if we interpret them as advice for optimizing personal health. For those who already pay a fair amount of attention to their health, such reductive guidelines can be counterproductive. For instance, although animal-derived protein tends to be higher quality and more bioavailable than plant-based proteins, the new guidelines might steer people away from the former, leading to insufficient intake of essential amino acids to support building and maintaining muscle mass. In other words, the DGA are meant to help those at more imminent risk of nutrition-related health problems, not to help any given individual attain maximal possible health. (Think of them like a walker or cane — great for improving mobility among the elderly or injured, but if used by an Olympic sprinter during a race, it will probably do more harm than good.) The bottom line Federal dietary guidelines serve a valuable purpose for public health in providing steps for avoiding both nutritional deficiencies and nutritional excess. Their simplicity makes them accessible and actionable for anyone — from elementary school students learning about food groups to adults without the time, money, education, or energy to undertake their own deep dive into nutrition research. They are a practical approach for improving the average health of the nation and reducing strain on the healthcare system, but they have never been intended to serve as a means of achieving maximal health for the individual. This is the lens through which we must view the recent addition of a recommendation to limit all meat, poultry, and eggs and prioritize beans, peas, and lentils as protein sources. The advice has been broadcast at face value by news outlets as validation of the notion that meat is unambiguously bad for health, but in truth, this guideline is merely a way of promoting an all-around healthier diet through factors correlated with meat consumption — for instance, overconsumption of saturated fats and processed foods and underconsumption of fiber and plant-derived vitamins and minerals. Such a simplistic guideline is expedient, but it can also be misleading for those who are already attentive to diet quality and other aspects of a healthy lifestyle. Human physiology (and the role of nutrition in affecting it) is extraordinarily complex and cannot be reduced to the few general statements of the DGA. Optimizing personal health requires a far more nuanced and sophisticated approach that takes into account the many dietary variables at play and the circumstances and preferences of the individual. So five years down the road, when the USDA rolls out the next set of updates to the DGA, let’s all take them with a few grains of salt… and perhaps with a nice chicken sandwich or omelet, too.

Show Notes Defining insomnia: diagnosis, prevalence, and misconceptions [3:00] Where did your interest in insomnia arise? Ashley has been interested in sleep for a long time She went to the University of Arizona for her doctoral work and studied with the late Dick Bootzin He’s one of the co-inventors of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) Ashley found CBT-I particularly interesting because it works so well We have so many different psychological treatments and they all have varying degrees of efficacy and effectiveness The thing about CBT-I is that it’s kind of like a recipe: if you do it, it works This was always just so interesting because it was so different than so many other psychotherapies out there that had so much more unpredictable outcomes Ashley became much more interested in CBT-I after her postdoctoral work When she was a post-doc at UCSF and started her assistant professorship, there was this gaping hole in treatment available for people with insomnia She thought this might be a good way for her to get back into some clinical work (she was just doing research at the time) “I fell back in love with it because there’s almost nothing as rewarding as being able to see a patient seven times and that seventh time have them say something along the lines of, ‘I have my life back.’”‒ Ashley Mason Patients say something along the line of, “I have my life back.” I’m going to get my drivers license back I’m not afraid to drive with my kids in the car anymore I’m going to go back to work Ashley grew the clinic that she does CBT-I in She loves it so much that she does it on top of her job She meets with patients after hours, at night because it’s the most rewarding thing, and you can have such a big impact on people And people need it Help folks understand a little bit about insomnia and maybe go through some of the definitions around the different types of insomnia and maybe some of the different causes for it And also what some of the other treatments for insomnia are ⇒ 90% of adults at some point are going to struggle with insomnia, and at any given moment that might be between 5-10% The interesting thing about insomnia is that it’s a very clinical diagnosis There’s no blood test for insomnia We can’t put you in a sleep lab overnight and do a test to see if you have insomnia We don’t diagnose insomnia based on one night of bad sleep If someone says, “I didn’t sleep at all last night, or I haven’t slept even for just the last week,” that’s not going to get a diagnosis of insomnia There’s a whole suite of different “somnias” that we could talk about The point that is the most salient [for defining insomnia] is just that when you have a problem sleeping and when it’s been going on for at least 3 months (a long time) When you really feel it’s a problem, that’s when it’s time to get help ⇒ There’s plenty of people who don’t sleep a whole lot, but it’s not distressing to them, it’s not causing any problems in their life; they’re not going to meet a definition of insomnia per se The folks who will tell you, “I can’t sleep, haven’t been sleeping for months. It’s interfering with my life. It’s really upsetting.” And they’ve probably already started trying a whole bunch of things to try and help themselves to fix it (and this is where things get interesting) Peter clarifies the point estimates [of prevalence] of insomnia 5-10% of the population would have insomnia at any point in time Where it’s been going on for months, and it’s causing distress and impacting life At the low end, that’s 1 in 20 At the high end, that’s 1 in 10 adults That’s a higher estimate than Peter would have guessed, given her definition ⇒ Everything Ashley is talking about today is adults (she doesn’t do pediatrics) Insomnia is for most people, probably quite episodic It’s not necessarily a permanent state People go in and out of it The question is how quickly do people go out of it when they go in it? And that’s what CBTI is so beautiful for ‒ it’s helping people get out of it quickly There’s going to be things in your life that are going to just happen and they’re going to put you over the threshold for insomnia How insomnia develops, and breaking the cycle with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) [7:45] How insomnia begins and then how it’s perpetuated These things are actually quite different Everybody has a certain level of predisposing factors that are going to put us at risk for having sleeping problems, in particular, insomnia Then we may experience what’s called a precipitating factor That could be a major life event like losing your job, getting a divorce, getting in a car accident Some major unexpected unhappy life event that might throw you into a bout of insomnia That event will end, and you will move on But in the meantime, when you’re dealing with that event, you develop behaviors to cope with it For example, pop a Benadryl to help you sleep or an Ambien (something stronger) You might start taking naps the next day after a bad night of sleep to try and cope with it You might start reading in bed a lot or flipping through your smartphone in bed Doing all these different types of behaviors to try and help yourself calm down and actually get to sleep, which in the short term make a lot of sense You’re trying to help yourself in the acute moment But in the long term, these kinds of behaviors aren’t actually doing you any favors And over time that precipitating factor is going to go away But all of these behaviors that you’ve started doing to respond to the precipitating event, they’re what stick around; and those are what are going to perpetuate insomnia symptoms and problems Can you say more about the predisposing factors? Are those genetic? Genetic predisposing factors 1 – Patients will say they are a light sleeper That’s tough to fix Ashley will recommend something like earplugs and eye mask, a white noise machine 2 – If you are higher on the general psychological reactivity, you’re going to probably get pushed over the threshold more easily than someone else Some people might get in a car accident, a fender bender, and they’re over it by the next day Other people might feel more anxious as a result of that event And that’s going to differ from person to person You can argue that that’s genetic You can argue that that’s based on early childhood or other experiences Nature and nurture probably both contribute to that predisposition and there’s not a whole lot that we can do about that The beauty of CBT-I When people come in for treatment, they’re often pretty focused on what caused their insomnia Ashley doesn’t ask people what caused their insomnia until the end of her first session with them She’s asking them all these other kinds of questions about their behaviors now And at the end she asks, “Okay, so when did this start? What do you think might have caused this?” And get their attribution for what’s going on Because at the end of the day, the intervention’s the same That might differ a lot from the practice of medicine She’s not an MD, she’s a PhD In a lot of disease states, we often look at what caused what’s going on She’s not really concerned She’s more concerned about what you’re doing now that’s perpetuating the problem, and that’s where she intervenes “That’s why this particular treatment is so effective for so many different presentations of insomnia and causes of insomnia.”‒ Ashley Mason Whether people have difficulty falling asleep in the beginning of the night, waking up in the middle of the night, waking up too early in the morning You might think these people all need wildly different treatment, but that’s not actually the case Peter’s takeaway ‒ the focus is much more on the coping strategy and the behavior that came out of the predisposing factor or the precipitating event {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

In an effort to provide my readers and listeners with valuable insights for improving your health and wellness, I find I’m often absorbing new information and making behavioral changes right alongside you. Such was the case with my recent “Ask Me Anything” foray into the topic of microplastics, in which I described strategies for reducing exposure and their relative costs and effort requirements. I certainly learned quite a bit while preparing for this episode, but in addition, many of you generously shared with me your suggestions for non-plastic products to use in place of plastic alternatives following the episode’s release. I’ve made a number of changes in my own home as a result, which I’ve highlighted in the video below. <iframe width=\"790\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IsmBq0v50k4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> I’ve included links below to the products shown in the video solely as a means of sharing suggestions that I’ve found useful myself. (Please note: I am not affiliated with the product manufacturers in any way and do not receive any money from product sales or for mentioning them here. I’m just passing along the product recommendations that I’ve received from podcast listeners since the AMA that I have found helpful myself. For anyone who is interested in my disclosures, you can always find up-to-date information on them here: peterattiamd.com/disclosures.) These are likely not the only options available for someone looking to replace plastic items in their homes, nor are the mitigation strategies I discussed in the video the only possible ways to reduce exposure (more are discussed in the AMA). They represent my personal choices and where I decided to draw my own line with cost and effort to limit exposure, but not everyone needs to follow the same formula. We don’t yet have a clear understanding of the health implications of microplastic exposure, and even with the greatest possible investment of money and effort, we can’t eliminate exposure completely. So each individual must decide for themselves and their families where to strike a balance. I simply hope that by sharing the knowledge I’ve used to inform my personal choices, I might better empower you all to make your own.

Others take no medications but have a supplement list that is two pages long. Most patients fall somewhere in between. The mental model for evaluation: Supplements are analyzed using a process similar to how the kidney filters glucose, sodium, and potassium: Everything is “dumped out” first, and then the question is asked: What should be added back in? This doesn’t mean literally stopping everything, but it serves as a thought process for analysis. Patients Often Don’t Know Why They Take Certain Supplements Many patients don’t have a clear reason for why they are taking certain supplements. Common responses when asked why they take a supplement: “I saw someone on Instagram talking about it.” “A doctor recommended it years ago, but I don’t remember why.” This lack of clarity reinforces the need for a structured evaluation framework. The Misconception About “Natural” Supplements vs. Pharmaceuticals Some patients strongly prefer supplements over medications and express views such as: “I don’t believe in taking medicine—only natural supplements.” Peter’s response: There is a difference between supplements and pharmaceuticals, but patients should truly understand that difference instead of making assumptions. The key distinction is regulation, not necessarily effectiveness or safety. Regulatory Differences Between Supplements & Pharmaceuticals Supplements: Not regulated by the FDA in the same way as pharmaceuticals. Are generally classified as “GRAS” (Generally Regarded as Safe) by the FDA. The process for determining safety is not rigorous and lacks formal oversight. Pharmaceuticals: While not perfect, they undergo a more stringent approval process. Must clear regulatory hurdles before being prescribed. Overlapping Ingredients Between Supplements & Pharmaceuticals Some supplements contain active ingredients found in prescription drugs. Example: Red rice yeast vs. Statins Some patients refuse to take a statin (e.g., pravastatin) to lower ApoB. However, they are comfortable taking red rice yeast, not realizing that: High doses of red rice yeast function similarly to a modest dose of pravastatin. Key lesson: The natural vs. pharmaceutical distinction is often misleading, and all molecules should be evaluated through the same lens. Purpose of the Framework Discussion The goal is to analyze supplements objectively rather than emotionally or ideologically. Today’s discussion focuses on over-the-counter supplements because: It’s the most common area of patient confusion. It is harder to evaluate compared to pharmaceuticals due to lack of regulation. The framework being introduced will help patients critically assess any supplement they take.

      "title": "A reminder on the importance of sleep for brain health",
      "content": "Epidemiological studies are full of flaws and considerable limitations – not the least of which being that they often make inappropriate causal claims based on purely correlational data. Nevertheless, as long as we remain aware of their shortcomings, such studies can serve the purpose of generating new hypotheses or providing results which might corroborate (not prove) existing theories regarding the relationships between two variables. Such is the cautious mindset we must adopt in considering a recent paper by Cavaillès et al.1 on the relationship between poor sleep and brain aging. Although many methodological flaws limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the study itself, the work serves as a timely reminder (this past week was the National Sleep Foundation’s annual “Sleep Awareness Week,” after all) of the much larger body of evidence supporting the critical role of sleep in cognitive health. About the study The authors of this observational study used data from 589 participants (mean age: 40.4±3.4 years at baseline) in the long-term CARDIA study of cardiovascular disease who had filled out a baseline sleep quality questionnaire in 2000-01 (566 of whom had also filled out a second sleep questionnaire in 2005-06). The questionnaires asked participants about six of what the authors termed “poor sleep characteristics” (PSCs), which included factors like daytime sleepiness, early morning awakening, and difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. Each questionnaire was then assigned a score of 0-6 depending on how many of these PSCs were present. As part of the CARDIA protocol, all subjects underwent a brain MRI scan 15 years after the initial sleep questionnaire, after which the authors used the Spatial Pattern of Atrophy for Recognition of Brain Aging (SPARE-BA) method to determine “brain age” for each subject. The SPARE-BA method uses algorithms involving structural brain characteristics to quantify differences in age-related atrophy. The higher the value determined by the SPARE-BA method, the more age-related atrophy is present, and thus, the “older” the brain (or so the logic goes). The authors found that MRI-determined brain age increased in subjects with PSCs in a dose-response manner. Compared to the group with 0-1 PSCs, subjects with 2-3 PSCs reportedly had a brain age that was 1.9 years older (95% CI: 0.55–3.18), while subjects with greater than 3 PSCs had a brain age that was 3.5 years older (95% CI: 1.53–5.56). They also found that difficulty initiating sleep and early morning awakening were both specifically associated with the greatest increases in brain age relative to not having those specific PSCs. Again, this study is observational, so the observed correlations do not provide evidence of causation. To make matters worse, sleep quality was measured by questionnaires, which are subject to response bias and other sources of error associated with self-reporting – not to mention that they assume sleep habits aren’t subject to substantial changes over time. And finally, it’s unclear how well MRI data and the SPARE-BA method were truly capable of accurately predicting “brain age” or potential cognitive consequences. It’s doubtful whether a difference in MRI-determined brain age of 1.8 years is actually meaningful or would correspond to clinically noticeable differences in an individual’s cognitive function or future cognitive trajectory. (The authors did not have data on cognitive function among the MRI subjects.) Indeed, it seems there is no end to the shortcomings of this study, so why even bother discussing it? The bigger picture The methodological problems should make us extremely skeptical of the study’s results (we certainly can’t conclude, for instance, that the tendency to wake early in the morning at your present age will cause your brain to be 3.8 years older than it otherwise would have been 15 years from now). And yet, as is true for virtually all attempts to ascertain long-term health consequences of chronic lifestyle habits, investigating the impact of sleep on brain health over the course of decades is extremely challenging, so we have to consider how the entire body of evidence fits together. A definitive evaluation of the relationship between sleep and brain health in a long-term randomized trial isn’t possible for numerous ethical and logistical reasons. So instead, we must take the many imperfect pieces that exist – i.e., from animal studies, short-term RCTs, and yes, epidemiology – and try to build as complete a picture as possible. Cavaillès et al.’s work may add little to the existing body of knowledge on sleep, brain aging, and cognitive health, but the correlations they report nevertheless align with clues we’ve obtained from more rigorous investigations. For instance, mechanistic experiments have shown that loss of sleep triggers an increase in neuroinflammation and impairment of the glymphatic system (the brain’s “sewage system”), which in turn have been linked to neurodegenerative disease.2 Even a single night of sleep deprivation has been found to increase levels of amyloid-beta, a protein implicated in Alzheimer’s disease pathology,3 as well as altering learning-related neural connectivity.4 I discuss this evidence in greater detail in my three–part series with sleep expert Matthew Walker on The Drive, but collectively, findings to date strongly support the importance of sleep as a preventative measure against dementia, to support learning and memory, and to promote mental health, among countless other benefits. Thus, at the very least, the study by Cavaillès et al. helps to draw fresh attention to a conclusion better made by previous work: sleep is vital for brain health. The bottom line Scientific literature must always be evaluated with a critical and unbiased eye, whether it supports our pre-existing beliefs or not, and this recent study on sleep and brain health is no exception. From flawed methods for acquiring sleep data to unvalidated methods for assessing brain age, the many problems with this study prevent us from drawing reliable conclusions from it. However, the value of this work can perhaps be found in how it fits within the larger pool of knowledge generated to date on the effect of sleep on long-term brain health. Given the logistical difficulty of directly examining this subject, we must look to that body of evidence as a whole (which includes several far more rigorous investigations than observational study discussed here). In taking that wider view, we can see more clearly that sufficient, high-quality sleep is one of the most important “interventions” we can make for our cognitive health.

      "content": "Jeff English is a trauma-focused clinical counselor with extensive experience working with adults, teens, families, and groups across various settings, including career counseling, life coaching, addiction recovery, professional workshops, and private practice. In this episode, Jeff shares insights from his work as a trauma therapist, exploring how moments of perceived helplessness shape behaviors and how adaptive strategies can become maladaptive over time. He discusses the concept of the “trauma tree,” examining its roots (causes) and branches (consequences), and highlights a powerful framework used at the Bridge to Recovery, a residential workshop where Jeff operated for over 8 years. Jeff reflects on the transformative power of group therapy, the role of vulnerability in fostering connection, and the challenges of letting go of control. He also offers practical advice on finding a great trauma therapist, balancing personal growth within relationships, and recognizing when it’s time to seek help.

Show Notes Defining trauma—a loaded word [3:00] Talk a little bit about this loaded word of “trauma” When Peter was first introduced to this idea of trauma, he didn’t know what that meant Today it’s become such a catchy buzzword, that everybody is traumatized by something How do you describe trauma as a trauma therapist and as someone who’s been doing trauma therapy for many years? The big traumas (“big T”) are being in war: Vietnam, 9/11 attack, etc. Within the spirit of the work, really embracing a definition: moments of perceived helplessness, that’s what’s going to activate the limbic system ⇒ Who is to say what one limbic system evaluates as helplessness versus another? That’s when we get into this discovery most people have made of, “Wow, I think I did experience trauma.” Jeff works with clients individually and in groups He thinks we often make things too complex A lot of what he does is try to depolarize for folks Getting into these situations to where we live in this world of “get-over-it, it doesn’t matter” Versus, like Peter mentioned, perhaps we stay stuck in it ⇒ Moments of perceived helplessness activate the limbic system Wounding events ‒ one of those would be a tragic event Life seems to be going one way before this thing happens, and then this thing happens, and life changes and everything is different on the other side of that “big T” event Versus someone who maybe you could describe it as “a thousand paper cuts” [“little t” events] Someone growing up, going through childhood, daily being limbically activated, but moments of perceived helplessness That stuck for Jeff, and it stuck for a lot of clients The therapeutic process at The Bridge to Recovery: confronting discomfort, embracing vulnerability, and reframing one’s story [5:45] Peter met Jeff at a place called The Bridge to Recovery in December of 2017 (7 years ago) Peter wrote about it somewhat reluctantly in Outlive, but without that chapter, the book was incomplete How a place like The Bridge to Recovery comes to exist, and how therapists like Jeff come to work at places like that It might be shocking to some, how much group therapy is done at a place like that When Peter looks back through his journal, it’s amazing how complex it was for him to be able to open up in front of a group He spent the first few days saying virtually nothing, largely because of that discomfort In his book, Peter described The Bridge as this wonderful, horrible place in the woods of Bowling Green, Kentucky Some folks call it residential treatment; some people call it trauma camp Other names Peter wrote down: Camp Misery, The Sadness Factory, and The Tree of Pain Jeff couldn’t argue with any of those Jeff describes it as residential treatment for disconnection Most folks think disconnection sounds vague When many think of residential treatment, they tend to jump to substance abuse (where people go to get sober) Jeff explains, “Disconnection is just the concept that’s used at The Bridge, and one way of disconnecting is substance abuse, but also screens, sex, relationships, ego, anger. So you just take away the substance, take away the word alcohol, and plug in whatever word you want to.” The group process You might have a group of 8 folks, and there might be 3 folks who identify as substance abusers and 2 as workaholics “You may disconnect differently than I do, Peter, but the commonality is that, especially when life throws us a curveball, this disconnected version of me seems to come out, jump in my driver’s seat, if you will.”‒ Jeff English There’s a big part of Jeff that doesn’t want to give away the secrets ‒ let the magic happen But you can know everything that’s going to happen, and then you start going through the process, and discomfort is what it’s all about That’s when stuff comes up That’s the whole idea Monday is admissions day, and counselors would usually meet the groups by Tuesday Countless times Jeff has tried to help talk folks off the ledge of leaving In summary, their reasons are an increase in anxiety (the details differ) They may say, “I came to The Bridge and my anxiety was at a 7. Right now I think it’s a 9. I need to get the heck out of here. This place ain’t for me.” This is the evidence that The Bridge is exactly the right place for them Peter remembers that first day (Monday) is a very unpleasant day Explain the objectives of phase 1: The telling of one’s life story Getting your history straight Many folks have done it before, but here it’s through the lens of what the counselors introduce as “the trauma tree” It’s the “what happened to me” story So many of us for years (sometimes decades) have been telling the story of what’s wrong with me From the very beginning, the shift, the hope is to move a little bit closer to what happened to me Not within the spirit of an excuse, but an explanation It makes sense that I do this thing that I do now The group process brings up the stuff Jeff calls “the guards” Parts therapist will call them protective parts (this isn’t new) It’s “ego states” (new terminology) ⇒ Guard refers to the protective side of a person that comes up when they get vulnerable When does someone get vulnerable? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "A causal link between obesity and autoimmune disease",
      "content": "The global obesity epidemic may be fueling a parallel rise in autoimmune conditions, in which the body mounts an immune response against its own, healthy tissue. If true, this connection between body weight and autoimmunity would further compound public health crises related to obesity, but although past observational studies hinted at a connection, the critical question has remained unanswered: does obesity cause these conditions, or is it merely a bystander? A recent study sought to address this gap, with the hope that improving our understanding of the relationship between obesity and autoimmune disease might provide new approaches to prevention or treatment of the latter. Inferring causality from observational data Observational studies can only show correlations and cannot establish causality, in large part because of the potential for confounding variables. Obesity, for instance, is associated with numerous other variables — such as diet quality, metabolic health, exercise habits, and even age — which may independently impact risk of autoimmune disease, making it impossible to isolate the effects of obesity per se. While randomized controlled trials are a classic solution to the problem of confounds (as known and unknown confounding factors should be evenly distributed between the groups when group assignments are random), such trials would be impractical and unethical for assessing the effects of obesity, given the many known health risks of excess body weight. Thus, to investigate the question of causality in the obesity/autoimmunity relationship, authors Li et al. employed a technique commonly used for simulating a randomized trial in an observational study: Mendelian randomization (MR). Longtime readers will likely be familiar with MR from previous newsletters, but as a brief refresher, this methodology uses gene variants that are predictive of a specific exposure (in this case, increased body weight) as a proxy for the exposure itself. Because gene variants are randomly assigned at conception (that is, they are not influenced by the individual’s lifestyle or environment), using these variants simulates randomization and eliminates the influence of the many confounding variables associated with obesity itself. About the study The investigators analyzed genetic data from over 550,000 individuals from the UK Biobank and the FinnGen study for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA that are known to predict various obesity metrics.1 Specifically, the authors used 68 SNPs that were predictive of body mass index (BMI), 52 that were predictive of hip circumference, 41 for waist circumference, and 29 for waist-to-hip ratio. They then investigated the associations between these SNPs and 15 autoimmune diseases, including asthma, celiac disease, and type 1 diabetes, among others. Looking at one of the metrics, BMI, Li et al. found that for each point increase in BMI (or more precisely, a unit increase in the genetically predicted BMI), the risk of several autoimmune conditions increased significantly. The data showed a 28% increased risk for asthma (odds ratio (OR): 1.28; 95% CI: 1.18-1.09; P<0.001), 37% for hypothyroidism (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.24-1.51; P<0.001), 52% for psoriasis (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.27-1.83; P<0.001), 22% for rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.06-1.40; P=0.005), and a 55% increase in risk for type 1 diabetes (OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.32-1.83; P<0.001). As expected for a pseudo-randomized study, nearly all of these associations remained robust even after accounting for potential confounding factors like smoking and drinking behaviors. The single exception was rheumatoid arthritis, which lost statistical significance after adjustment (though significance had only been borderline in the unadjusted model). Results were generally similar for the other obesity metrics tested, though associations were somewhat stronger for waist circumference and weaker for waist-to-hip ratio. Some less common autoimmune conditions had limited data available, meaning we may not yet understand the full scope of obesity’s impact on autoimmune disease. Additionally, the data used for this study came from people of European descent (for whom we have the most information regarding associations between SNPs and health implications), meaning the study’s findings are primarily applicable to this population, and further research is needed to confirm any relationships in other ethnic groups. Regardless, the data presented provide a compelling case for a causal link between excess weight and several autoimmune conditions. How does fat drive autoimmunity? Why might obesity trigger autoimmune conditions? To understand this, we need to think about the effects of excess adiposity on inflammation. The accumulation of fat tends to fuel systemic inflammation by triggering the release of pro-inflammatory molecules (including IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, and IFN-γ), but not all fat contributes equally to this inflammatory state. Unlike subcutaneous fat, visceral and ectopic fat (fat that accumulates around and within internal organs) are particularly strong drivers of chronic inflammation, which in turn can overwhelm the body’s regulatory mechanisms and potentially lead to autoimmune responses (for more on addressing chronic inflammation, see AMA #59). But how much fat does it take to drive inflammation and autoimmunity? Unfortunately, there is no single threshold that applies to everyone. As discussed in greater depth in a premium article on body composition, individuals vary in their capacity for “normal” fat storage in subcutaneous depots, and once this capacity is exceeded, fat begins to accumulate in the viscera, triggering greater systemic inflammation. Though the exact level of fat required to reach this “spillover” point may differ across individuals, everyone will eventually reach their personal threshold if fat accumulation continues. I often use a bathtub analogy to explain this concept. Imagine subcutaneous fat as the place your body was designed to store excess energy safely — like water in a bathtub. Some people have a large tub, while others have a smaller one (determined in part by genetics), but if water flowing in (i.e., the calories you’re consuming) consistently exceeds the water draining out (i.e., the calories you’re expending), the tub eventually overflows. The implication from these mechanistic insights is that visceral fat — rather than BMI per se — drives the association between obesity and autoimmunity. Indeed, this conclusion would be supported by Li et al.’s data showing generally stronger positive associations with autoimmune conditions for genetic variants associated with waist circumference — a rough indicator of visceral fat — than with genetic variants for BMI itself. However, because everyone has an [unknown] upper limit to their capacity to store fat subcutaneously, the probability of exceeding that limit increases for everyone as total fat mass increases. Thus, the best strategy for avoiding autoimmunity caused by excess visceral fat is to keep total fat mass in check. The bottom line The link between obesity and disease is not new, but this study reinforces just how far-reaching the consequences of excess adiposity can be. It provides causal evidence that obesity may directly increase the risk of autoimmune conditions, adding to the long list of reasons to prioritize metabolic health. The message is clear: addressing obesity isn’t just about aesthetics or even traditional obesity-associated health concerns like cardiovascular disease or diabetes. It’s about preventing a cascade of potential health consequences that can significantly impact the length and quality of life, and autoimmune conditions are another addition to this list. With the extensive impacts of excess fat accumulation, avoiding it by maintaining energy balance is a critical element of any plan for preventing chronic disease.

Olav Aleksander Bu Pt.2 episode: metrics to track aerobic efficiency and insights about VO2 max, and the ability of increased carbohydrate consumption to boost performance [4:30] #331 ‒ Optimizing endurance performance: metrics, nutrition, lactate, and more insights from elite performers | Olav Aleksander Bu (Pt. 2) (January 13, 2025) *** Peter’s biggest insights from the second episode with Olav We talked beforehand about trying to make it a little less technical because the first one was pretty technical Peter could not resist the tractor pull of trying to explain some technical things Looking back, he was probably more technical They started the discussion by explaining the difference between things like functional threshold power and critical power Peter hesitates to bring these up now because he just doesn’t think they’re relevant unless you are a cyclist ⇒ The functional threshold power (or FTP) is the power that you can hold for one hour One way to test it: get on a stationary bike and ride as hard as you can without blowing up for 1 hour Whatever the average power is that you held is your FTP When Peter was a cyclist, he would do this in a 20-minute test and would typically discount it by 10% Olaf suggested discounting by only 5% In Peter’s experience, 10% was necessary ⇒ Critical power is very similar, but rather than it being the power you can hold for an hour, it’s the power you can hold for 30 to 40 minutes The important distinction here is critical power is much easier to calculate You can do it from a set of curves that are derived from 3-4 individual tests that are much shorter Why is this relevant? If you want to have other metrics beyond VO2 max for higher end aerobic efficiency, you might want to know your FTP or critical power, and critical power is much easier to measure These days Peter doesn’t spend a lot of time worrying about his FTP In fact, he doesn’t know what it is It made Peter realize maybe he ought to do a critical power test just so that he has another benchmark to be tracking A personal insight about power at VO2 max (PVO2 max) This is the relationship between VO2 max and PVO2 max (or vVO2 max [which is velocity at VO2 max]) VO2 max is maximum ventilation, meaning maximum oxygen consumption It’s usually sustained for at least a minute when you’re doing the test It’s the highest amount of oxygen in liters per minute that can be consumed for a minute This is achieved during a ramp exercise, almost exclusively done on a stationary bike or on a treadmill And when you hit that VO2 max, you will note the velocity If you’re on a treadmill, assuming you’re running flat Or if you’re on a bike, then your PVO2 max is the power that you’ve achieved Some have argued that vVO2 max or PVO2 max are actually more predictive of sports specific performance than just the number VO2 max Peter thinks there might be something to that because he shared his numbers with Olaf and the truth of it is he has always had a very low PV02 max to VO2 max Stated another way, he has always had a VO2 max that is higher than many people who are much better cyclists It wasn’t uncommon when he was training that his VO2 max was 15 points higher than people who had a higher FTP than him What Olaf suggested speaks to an inefficiency there Peter may be over-training aerobically and undertraining anaerobically That inefficiency means that he is actually requiring more energy across the board to put out more power Something interesting that comes from that is there might be an association between people like that and a lesser propensity to gain weight Every time Peter has done a resting metabolic expenditure test (he’s actually done the doubly labeled water test and the metabolic chambers), he always seems to have a through-the-roof energy expenditure for his body weight For the first time, that all came together On the one hand he has an advantage perhaps in that he has a very high energy expenditure So relative to somebody else who eats as much as he does, he’s going to be leaner The flip side of that is he is actually quite inefficient at utilizing energy Beyond training, is there anything a person can do to boost their VO2 max ⇒ Beetroot concentrate is rich in nitrates {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to this entire podcast episode, its extensive show notes, and more premium content?

      "content": "When it comes to human papillomavirus (HPV), the first thing that comes to mind might be the links between this common sexually transmitted infection (STI) and cervical cancer. Indeed, infection with a “high-risk” HPV type is now thought to be a necessary step in cervical cancer development,1 and therefore, after the FDA approved the first HPV vaccine back in 2006, the CDC quickly began recommending routine vaccination of female adolescents and young adults. A few years later, vaccination was recommended for males as well, partly in an effort to prevent spread to females. Yet mounting evidence indicates that some subtypes may also have significant negative effects on male fertility and reproductive health. A recent study in Argentina shed further light on these effects, underscoring the importance of HPV screening and vaccination, regardless of sex. The HPV epidemic HPV, a family encompassing over 200 viruses usually transmitted through sexual contact, isn’t just common – it is practically ubiquitous. Over 85% of all sexually active individuals will acquire an HPV infection at some point in their lives, and with an estimated 13 million Americans infected each year, it is by far the most common STI in the United States and likely worldwide.2,3 Fortunately, HPV infection is also usually harmless. In most cases, it resolves on its own in a matter of months, often going completely unnoticed. Yet a small subset of HPV viruses have long been recognized as having the potential to persist for years and lead to certain cancers. Most notable among these is cervical cancer, though infection with these HPV types is also a major risk factor in cancers of the oropharynx and anus.4 Though these latter cancers can occur in either sex, women have continued to be the primary focus when it comes to HPV’s potential long-term consequences, and vaccination rates among girls and young women continue to outpace those among boys and young men.5 However, new insights on health impacts that are specific to males may help to even this imbalance and promote more equal emphasis on preventative measures in males and females. About the study For this cross-sectional study, authors Olivera et al. recruited 205 male patients (mean age: 35 years; 95% CI: 34–36 years) with concerns related to fertility or the lower urinary tract and, as controls, urology or andrology patients with no fertility or urinary concerns.6 Individuals who had previously been vaccinated against HPV, had undergone a vasectomy, or had certain known urogenital conditions or bacterial infections were excluded. Participants provided a semen sample following 3-5 days of abstinence from sexual activity, and the samples were analyzed for the presence of various HPV subtypes and a number of other viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. Of the 205 patients tested, 19% (27 participants) were found to be HPV-positive (HPV+). These participants were divided into two groups: 20 patients were infected with at least one HPV type associated with high cancer risk and thus were designated as the “high-risk” HPV (HR-HPV) group, while the remaining seven had exclusively low-risk infections and were designated as the “low-risk” HPV (LR-HPV) group. Additionally, 43 patients had no detected urogenital pathogens in semen samples, and these individuals served as a control group. Results from individuals with infections other than HPV were excluded from further study. Semen samples were then evaluated for semen quality, inflammatory markers, and markers of oxidative stress. Sperm analysis revealed that the groups did not differ significantly in sperm count or other routine sperm parameters related to motility or morphology. However, those in the HR-HPV group exhibited greater sperm necrosis – a form of cell death that is typically indicative of injury or a pathogenic state – than either the LR-HPV or control groups. In line with this finding, sperm from the HR-HPV group also showed substantially elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to the other groups, which may have led to cell damage and thus to the observed increase in rates of necrosis. (Indeed, this would agree with earlier research indicating that HPV infection leads to DNA damage in sperm, possibly via ROS production.7) Together, these findings add to a growing body of evidence that high-risk HPV can compromise male fertility through negative effects on sperm integrity and viability. What it means for aspiring fathers While these findings are concerning, we must keep them in perspective. Yes, nearly everyone who is sexually active will contract HPV at some point, and yes, it is increasingly evident that certain types of HPV can cause infertility in males. Olivera et al.’s results show that even these high-risk HPV infections are quite common, but these facts together still do not spell inevitable doom for men hoping to have children someday. First, we must recognize that this study – like most others that have investigated HPV and male fertility parameters – involved testing a single sperm sample from each patient, representing a single snapshot in time. While high-risk HPV types are known to persist in certain areas of the body (including the cervix) for years or even decades after infection, persistence in semen is unclear. It is entirely possible that seminal infections – along with any impacts on fertility – resolve over time. Additionally, if seminal infections do persist, they won’t necessarily result in complete infertility or prevent men from fathering children. High-risk HPV may reduce fertility and make it more challenging to conceive, but this is very unlikely to be a binary, all-or-nothing effect, and the magnitude of fertility reduction probably varies across individuals and across infections. The fact is, we don’t currently have even the slightest idea what percentage of high-risk HPV infections end up causing sufficient difficulty with conception to be noticeable or require medical intervention. And finally, even if HPV does result in significant difficulty with conception, options are available to overcome the negative impact. If a fertility clinic detects seminal HPV infection as the cause of a couple’s infertility, the couple may still be able to conceive through various assisted reproductive technology (ART) options such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). As part of this process, semen can undergo “sperm washing” procedures designed to remove the virus prior to IUI or IVF.7 For couples that can afford to wait a little longer to conceive after the infertility diagnosis (i.e., younger couples), an easier “fix” might be achieved through HPV vaccination, as vaccination following infection and infertility diagnosis has been shown to be effective in clearing virus from semen and in increasing rates of conception for those with HPV-attributed infertility.8 But of course, vaccines are most beneficial when administered before infection, and indeed, the best option for overcoming HPV-attributed infertility is to prevent HPV from taking hold in the first place by being vaccinated against high-risk forms of HPV. High-risk HPV is a [preventable] concern for both sexes The notion that HPV can have negative health impacts in males is not new, as certain HPV-related cancers have long been known to affect both sexes. But Olivera et al.’s results add to a growing body of evidence that high-risk HPV types can be detrimental in ways that are unique to men, compromising fertility through increases in ROS-associated sperm damage. (Of note, HPV infection does not appear to cause infertility among females.9) Further, these data indicate that these effects are common – accounting for a substantial percentage of cases of male infertility, which itself afflicts nearly one out of every 10 men of reproductive age in the United States. Taken together with risks for HPV-related cancers, these findings underscore that high-risk HPV is a concern for everyone, regardless of their sex. And yet, it doesn’t need to be. Existing vaccines target several of the high-risk types of HPV. In just the two decades since they were approved, they have shown astounding efficacy in preventing high-risk infections and reducing incidence of HPV-related cancers in both sexes – in addition to reducing male infertility.10,11 And while there are certainly other options to help overcome HPV-attributed infertility, compared to the HPV vaccine (which is free with most insurance plans), they are typically expensive and drawn-out – and perhaps less likely to succeed. So let’s take stock. Like females, males face the potential for significant health and wellness concerns caused by high-risk HPV. Like females, males can largely prevent those negative consequences with HPV vaccination. Like females, males can usually receive the vaccine free of charge. So why do males continue to lag behind females in HPV awareness and prevention? For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama References 1. Okunade KS.

      "title": "Metformin as a potential longevity medication: where do we stand?",
      "content": "Humans have sought interventions for lifespan extension for millennia, though over the last century, this quest has taken on a more formal, scientific approach. Since the early 20th century, such research has led to the identification of several potential “longevity molecules,”1 and in recent years, metformin has emerged as one of the most discussed candidates for this role, generating both excitement and skepticism within the scientific community. While many are familiar with metformin as a common medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the narrative around potential anti-aging properties of this drug began to take shape in the early 2000s with the discovery of life-extension effects in certain animal models. Subsequent observational data from humans fueled further excitement, but as conflicting evidence emerged in more recent years, interest in the possible role of metformin in human life extension began to lose steam. Yet in the late summer of 2024, a new study showing positive effects on aging markers in monkeys caught the attention of scientists and the popular press alike, and suddenly, metformin appeared to be back at the forefront of optimism over longevity drugs. So where does this leave us? How does the strength of evidence in favor of metformin as a longevity drug compare to the strength of evidence against it? What are the implications for the use of this drug in promoting healthspan versus lifespan? And what questions remain to be answered?",

Show Notes Metabolic disease as a foundational driver of chronic illness [4:00] People who listen to Peter are familiar with him talking about these 4 horsemen: Cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease Cancer Neurodegenerative and dementing diseases Metabolic disease This one is the squishiest because it’s not the one that shows up on the most death certificates, but in many ways, it’s the foundational one that is amplifying the risk of all of those other causes of death Spanning the spectrum from hyperinsulinemia to insulin resistance to fatty liver disease, all the way out to type 2 diabetes It seems very important that we should have a really thorough discussion of that foundational metabolic disease, and there’s no one better than Ralph to have that discussion Briefly tell folks what you’re doing at UT San Antonio and why you’ve spent the last 50 years working on this problem Ralph has been in this field of metabolic disease for a long time He may be the longest consecutively funded NIDDK investigator (53 years) He actually started even long before that when he was a medical student at Harvard He had this fantastic teacher, Professor Cahill, who gave the lectures on intermediary metabolism, and Ralph decided this is what he wanted to do He worked each summer with Professor Cahill “Sometimes in life you meet the right person, the right opportunity and it changes everything you do.”‒ Ralph DeFronzo What Ralph does now, he attributes directly to George When he gave the Banting Lecture in 2008 People usually put a picture of their mother, and father, and children Ralph loves his mother, and father, and children, but he only showed one picture and that was Professor Cahill because he’s really the person who’s ended up directing him to where he is today People who are listening, who are particularly astute, might recall that Peter has referenced a number of Cahill’s papers One of the more interesting studies he did, was the 40-day starvation study in the mid-60s A group of students at Harvard did a water-only fast for 40 days, and he followed all the metabolites One of the things that was interesting to Peter was that even under a period of extreme starvation, the brain never gave up its dependency on glucose Even though ketone bodies began to service the brain by about day 7-10 as the majority of the fuel, glucose was still providing about ⅓ of the brain’s energy The brain did switch over to ketone metabolism Ralph was not one of the people who did the 40-day fast, but he did fast for 5-7 days If you fasted for 3 days you could get paid $50, and Ralph thought he was the richest guy in the world from this study He can assure you that the physical specimens in this study were phenomenal The interesting thing you realize is that we have so much energy stored into human body Who would’ve thought that a lean type person can fast for 40 days? ⇒ The real problem is at some point you start to break down muscle And then if you start to break down cardiac muscle, prolonged fasting at that point becomes a problem But you have a lot of energy stored in fat and you can starve for a long time And obese people easily can go for 3, 4 months with all of the reserves that are in the body Defining insulin resistance: effects on glucose, fat, and protein metabolism, and how it varies between healthy, obese, and diabetic individuals [8:15] Insulin resistance is a term that gets thrown around constantly, explain what it is from a technical standpoint Every time you eat a meal and your blood sugar level goes up, you’re going to release insulin ⇒ Insulin is a master regulator for all biochemical processes in the body 1 – One of the things insulin is going to do, it’s going to talk to your muscles and say, “Take up glucose and burn that glucose.” What we need to know is, when you infuse insulin, how much of the glucose is taken up by the muscle We can compare a normal person, someone who is overweight, and someone who is diabetic “I actually developed the gold standard technique which is the insulin clamp technique to look at this.”‒ Ralph DeFronzo Comparing an overweight person to a lean person ‒ obese people are very insulin resistant in terms of muscle glucose uptake In a diabetic, they’re even more insulin resistant There are many processes that insulin controls 2 – Insulin regulates how much fat is released from your fat cells Unfortunately, insulin keeps the fat in your fat cell But in obese people insulin doesn’t work so well So instead of keeping the fat in the fat cell, even though your insulin is high, you’re breaking down the fat You have to look at each individual process that insulin is controlling ‒ insulin resistance is a general term because insulin controls many things For that process, we know how a normal person should respond and how a diabetic responds And the diabetic is much more insulin resistant 3 – Insulin controls protein metabolism ‒ it’s important in helping you build protein Ralph did a study infusing insulin and carbon-labeled leucine to define how insulin promotes protein metabolism in a normal healthy person He could do the same study in an obese person, and we know they don’t respond to insulin as well in terms of aggregating protein metabolism Peter asks, “Does that translate not just to structural proteins such as enzymes or cellular structural proteins but also macrostructural proteins such as muscle?” Absolutely You can look at specific enzymes within the cell or muscle in terms of muscle as a bulk There are many ways you could define insulin resistance, but whatever the particular process you’re looking at, you’re comparing what would be the normal response in a normal healthy person compared to what might happen in a diabetic person or an obese individual Peter’s takeaway on insulin resistance It’s a vague term and it’s non-specific because the actions of insulin are so many It has an action in the liver It has an action in the muscles It has an action with response to glucose It has an action with response to amino acids It has an action with response to fat, both in the liberation of fat, lipolysis, and presumably in response to oxidation The historical significance of the development of the euglycemic clamp technique for measuring insulin resistance [11:45] Explain how the euglycemic clamp test is done What would happen in a healthy individual? When Ralph was a fellow, at that time there was not a good measure of insulin sensitivity You do an oral glucose tolerance test and the insulin level would go up Some people would look at how much insulin comes out compared to the rise in glucose, and that’s a measure of ꞵ-cell function Then someone would just turn it around and look at how much the rise in glucose was per insulin, and that’s a measure of insulin resistance It was very clear to Ralph that this was insane You can’t take 2 variables and then, just depending upon how you want to look at them, switch denominator and numerator Ralph wanted to develop something more specific Unfortunately, clinicians are not able to do euglycemic clamps They are still looking at oral glycemic tolerance tests: giving people oral glucose, and sampling glucose and insulin every 30 minutes, and trying to impute what we can [we will come back to what you can learn from an OGTT at the end of the episode] Ralph developed a technique where you could take 100 people and infuse insulin (initially as a priming dose) and then just clamp the insulin level [and infuse enough glucose to keep it at 80; discussed further shortly] Give a prime continuous insulin infusion: raise their insulin level by 100 micro units per ml, and do that for 2 hours Figure 1. The euglycemic insulin clamp technique and examples of data obtained. Image credit: Obesity 2022 Now you know that the insulin stimulus, whether you’re lean, whether you’re obese, or whether you’re diabetic, whatever particular process that you want to look at Maybe you wanted to look at how insulin shut down a part of glucose production Ralph’s group was the first to ever use radioisotopes to trace this, and show that in normal people insulin shut down glucose production by the liver very quickly But obese people and diabetics were very, very resistant to the insulin {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "A common nasal decongestant appears to be ineffective, so what alternatives exist?",
      "content": "We’ve all been there, battling a cold with congestion so relentless that breathing through your nose is impossible. You reach for your decongestant of choice, but the much-desired relief for your stuffy nose never comes. You wonder if you took enough of the medication, or if it’s past its expiration date, or perhaps if you’re just cursed. But the truth is simple: the medicine was never effective in the first place. Oral phenylephrine is a common “active” ingredient in many popular cold, flu, and allergy medications, yet last November, the FDA proposed removing this decongestant from the market due to a lack of efficacy. Is this true? And if so, how did phenylephrine become so popular in the first place, and what alternatives might be more effective in bringing relief to those stubborn stuffy sinuses? Phenylephrine 101 Phenylephrine is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it narrows blood vessels. When applied to the nasal passages, its targeted action can reduce swelling and open up your airways, a mechanism that has made phenylephrine appealing for decades. In fact, the drug’s history stretches back to the 1930s, with a patent filed in 1933. In 1976, it was recognized as generally safe and effective by the FDA and approved for over-the-counter (OTC) use. The real boost in phenylephrine’s popularity, however, came in 2006. In light of concerns over the use of a different decongestant — pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) — for illicit methamphetamine production, Congress passed restrictions that moved pseudoephedrine behind pharmacy counters. Major cold and flu brands needed an alternative decongestant that could remain out in front for easy purchase, and thus, phenylephrine became the go-to substitute in products like Sudafed PE, Dayquil, and many others. Until now. In a 2023 decision, the FDA moved to re-evaluate oral phenylephrine, and in November 2024, they proposed removing it from the market altogether.1 Is this decision warranted? A closer look The FDA’s proposal came after a number of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials called into question the efficacy of phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant.2 For instance, a 2009 trial in 379 participants with seasonal allergies compared the standard dose of phenylephrine (10 mg) to placebo and to an alternative decongestant, loratadine-montelukast.3 While loratadine-montelukast was found to be effective in improving nasal congestion scores, participants treated with phenylephrine were indistinguishable from those given placebo in post-treatment symptoms. Yet an abundance of evidence also clearly shows that phenylephrine is an effective vasoconstrictor, which indeed ought to reduce swelling. So why does this seemingly logical mechanism fail to generate congestion relief in practice? The ineffectiveness has little to do with phenylephrine per se but rather with its route of administration. Phenylephrine taken orally, as you would in a cold medicine, is subject to first-pass metabolism in the liver. This removes the drug from the system before it reaches the site at which it is needed (i.e., the nose). Indeed, the oral bioavailability of phenylephrine is quite low (38%) compared to pseudoephedrine (90%).4 A common way to overcome low bioavailability is to administer higher doses. But in a 2015 trial testing a range of phenylephrine doses up to four times the standard dose (10, 20, 30, and 40 mg), none of the doses tested differed from placebo in their ability to improve subjective nasal congestion scores in participants with seasonal allergies.5 Though future studies may evaluate even higher doses, it is worth noting that risks associated with vasoconstriction (e.g., decreased heart rate and increased blood pressure) become more likely as doses climb upward. (Importantly, at the doses currently found on the market, phenylephrine is considered safe. If you have a bottle of Dayquil in your medicine cabinet, it is safe to use – it just isn’t effective for nasal decongestion.) How did phenylephrine slip through the system? As discussed in detail in last week’s newsletter, the FDA requires any new drugs to be proven safe and effective through a rigorous clinical trial process before receiving market approval, so how did phenylephrine slip through despite a lack of efficacy? Unfortunately, at the time that it was first commercialized, the high standards we have at present simply did not exist.6 While the first step in US history toward regulatory oversight of foods and drugs occurred in 1906 with the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act (which ensured products were accurately labelled with their ingredients) and the creation of the FDA, it wasn’t until 1938 that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulated the safety of drugs on the market. Even then, it would be another 24 years before the Kefauver-Harris Amendments introduced the requirement that drugs had to be deemed both safe and effective. Because phenylephrine reached the market in the 1930s, it was available to consumers before the new requirements came about. When the new regulations were passed, the FDA did review all current drugs on the market, but the standards simply were not as rigorous as they are now. For example, as modern critics of phenylephrine have pointed out, the FDA panel cited unpublished, manufacturer-sponsored studies and relied on only four studies demonstrating efficacy despite seven showing no difference between the FDA-approved dose (10 mg) and placebo.4 To make matters worse, the capacity of the FDA was overwhelmed with the sheer number of already-marketed OTC medications to review. In an effort to handle the volume, the FDA developed a monograph system — essentially a rulebook specifying which active ingredients were “generally recognized as safe and effective” for certain uses. Because phenylephrine made it onto the monograph (based on the lower standards of the time) as a nasal decongestant, companies in the 2000s were able to make the swap from pseudoephedrine to phenylephrine in cold medicines and continue to market them for congestion relief, despite a lack of evidence backing up the claim. Alternative options Although phenylephrine may be ineffective, we fortunately aren’t doomed to suffer nasal congestion every allergy season or with every cold. As discussed above, one effective alternative to phenylephrine is pseudoephedrine (e.g., Sudafed), often regarded as the gold standard oral decongestant. Studies have consistently shown that pseudoephedrine significantly improves nasal airflow and congestion scores. In one head-to-head trial involving 38 participants with seasonal allergies, a 60-mg dose of pseudoephedrine led to a 21.7% average decrease in congestion scores over six hours — far exceeding the 7.1% reduction with phenylephrine (which was statistically indistinguishable from placebo).7 Because pseudoephedrine travels through the bloodstream, it can address congestion across all nasal regions, giving relief for more widespread congestion. However, its mild stimulant properties (elevated heart rate, jitteriness) mean that those with high blood pressure should be cautious about using this drug. And due to concerns about illicit methamphetamine production, pseudoephedrine is kept behind the pharmacy counter in many places, requiring you to show ID and abide by purchase limits. Another strong contender for clearing a stuffy nose is oxymetazoline (e.g., Afrin, Vick’s Sinex), a topical nasal spray that can offer quick, potent relief. Working directly on nasal tissues, it starts reducing swelling within minutes and may last up to 12 hours, as confirmed by MRI-based trials showing a marked drop in turbinate volume (the structures that swell and block air flow).8 In this trial, run by Proctor & Gamble for their own product, the difference between sham and treatment ranged from ~20-50% depending on specific nasal area. Because only a small amount is absorbed into the bloodstream, oxymetazoline spares you from the jitteriness sometimes linked to oral decongestants. The main drawback is a risk of rebound congestion if you use it for more than 3–5 days in a row — an effect known as rhinitis medicamentosa. Most people handle oxymetazoline well for short-term use, but it’s crucial to heed the 3-day limit to avoid a cycle of worsening stuffiness once you stop. If congestion is driven by inflammation — such as with allergies — prescription steroid sprays like fluticasone or budesonide can gradually reduce swelling without causing rebound effects, though they take days or weeks to reach their full potential. Montelukast (brand name Singulair, mentioned briefly above) is also effective for relieving nasal congestion caused by inflammation and doesn’t require such a build-up period. However, some observational data suggest that the use of montelukast may be associated with increased risk of psychiatric concerns such as depression and anxiety in adolescents and young adults,9 so young patients and those at high risk of psychiatric conditions should consider other treatments. For adjunct options, you might explore saline nasal irrigation, menthol rubs, or other supportive measures; though in many cases, these may offer perceived — but not clinically significant — benefits. Most studies in a Cochrane review on nasal irrigation, for instance, found little effect of saline treatment, despite at least one trial in children reporting moderate relief in nasal obstruction.10 Simple interventions such as menthol rubs, humidifiers, or nasal strips may also foster a subjective feeling of clearer breathing, likely due to sensations like cooling or physically lifting the nasal passages, rather than delivering a quantifiable improvement in airflow. Adhesive nasal strips are a safe approach to physically pull open the nasal passages to increase air flow. Any of these supportive measures can be safely combined with pharmacological approaches. The bottom line Although the FDA maintains rigorous standards for new drug approvals, phenylephrine slipped through under older, less stringent regulations that never required comprehensive proof of effectiveness. This loophole allowed phenylephrine to dominate over-the-counter decongestant shelves for years, even as evidence accumulated that it offered little relief. However, although oral phenylephrine may soon disappear from store shelves, various effective alternatives are available. Tailor strategies to your symptoms and comfort level. If you want fast and powerful short-term relief, consider a brief course of oxymetazoline spray. When you need an oral solution that reliably reduces stuffiness over multiple days, pseudoephedrine is an excellent choice, provided you can handle its mild stimulant properties and follow pharmacy regulations. Importantly, you should not combine multiple pharmaceutical decongestants, as doing so increases the potential side effect risk while providing no additional benefit for congestion. Meanwhile, non-drug interventions like saline rinses or nasal strips can be a safer long-term component of your congestion toolkit. Each approach has its pros and cons, but together they offer a wide spectrum of alternatives to phenylephrine, helping you breathe easier.

How to accurately assess your cardiovascular health [3:00] The Importance of Cardiovascular Health Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Many people are curious about their current cardiovascular risk and how to properly assess it. Key Tools for Assessing Cardiovascular Risk Family History as a Primary Indicator One of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of risk assessment. It’s not enough to just know how long relatives lived; it’s important to understand: What conditions they had (e.g., high cholesterol, high blood pressure). Whether they took medications for cholesterol or hypertension. If they required cardiovascular procedures (e.g., stents, bypass surgery, revascularization). Early cardiovascular events in family members suggest potential heritable causes, such as: Elevated Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] Podcast: #07 – Deep Dive: Lp(a) — what every doctor, and the 10-20% of the population at risk, needs to know Podcast: #210 – Lp(a) and its impact on heart disease | Benoît Arsenault, Ph.D. Podcast: #238 – AMA #43: Understanding apoB, LDL-C, Lp(a), and insulin as risk factors for cardiovascular disease Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) Podcast: #255 ‒ Latest therapeutics in CVD, APOE’s role in Alzheimer’s disease and CVD, familial hypercholesterolemia, and more | John Kastelein, M.D., Ph.D. More resources Calcium Scan (CAC) for Assessing Arterial Damage A CAC scan helps determine the extent of arterial calcification, which indicates advanced disease. Article: Coronary artery calcium scan Podcast: #247 ‒ Preventing cardiovascular disease: the latest in diagnostic imaging, blood pressure, metabolic health, and more | Ethan Weiss, M.D. Podcast: #203 – AMA #34: What Causes Heart Disease? Key points about CAC: An ideal score is zero, meaning no calcification. However, a score of zero is not always definitive, as 15% of cases can have soft plaque not detected by CAC. In these cases, a CT angiogram (CTA) can provide a clearer picture but exposes the patient to radiation and contrast dye risks. Calcification itself is a protective mechanism, but its presence suggests an underlying cardiovascular process that could indicate broader risks. Lipid Profile and Blood Markers ApoB and Lp(a) are the two most critical markers. More on apoB: Podcast: #229 ‒ Understanding cardiovascular disease risk, cholesterol, and apoB Article on apoB: Measuring cardiovascular disease risk and the importance of apoB Podcast: #238 – AMA #43: Understanding apoB, LDL-C, Lp(a), and insulin as risk factors for cardiovascular disease LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol are less relevant once ApoB and Lp(a) are known. Triglycerides are important only when extremely elevated (>400 mg/dL), which can indicate metabolic issues requiring intervention. Blood Pressure as a Major Risk Factor Hypertension is a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease and is often under-monitored. Key blood pressure considerations: Ideal blood pressure is below 120/80 mmHg. 130/85 mmHg, previously considered normal, is now known to increase risk. Doctors often measure blood pressure incorrectly—proper technique includes: Sitting still for five minutes before measurement. Ensuring the arm is positioned at heart level. Using a properly fitting cuff and avoiding crossed legs. Checking multiple readings (duplicate or triplicate measurements). Monitoring at home twice daily for two weeks once a year provides a better assessment. Resources: Article: All things blood pressure: from measurement to management Podcast: #258 – AMA #48: Blood pressure—how to measure, manage, and treat high blood pressure Lifestyle and Metabolic Factors Smoking significantly increases CVD risk. Metabolic health plays a critical role, including: Hyperinsulinemia Insulin resistance Type 2 diabetes Addressing metabolic dysfunction is crucial for long-term cardiovascular health. Tests and Metrics Not Considered as Useful Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT) Peter does not find CIMTs particularly useful for assessing cardiovascular risk. The data does not support CIMT as a superior tool compared to the aforementioned tests.

      "title": "How can the process of drug development be improved?",
      "content": "Pharmaceuticals are one of modern medicine’s tools to prevent and treat acute and chronic diseases – everything from treating cancer to lowering plasma lipids for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Yet the process of drug discovery and development is long and expensive, and the vast majority of drugs that enter this pipeline will ultimately fail to reach the point of FDA approval. The expense and high failure rate can contribute to the high price tags on many medications that do end up on the market (as discussed in depth by Saum Sutaria on a recent episode of The Drive). But why do so many drug candidates fail? And how might the drug development process be improved in order to better allocate resources toward the most viable options? Stages of drug development Before we can evaluate potential areas for improvement, we first need to understand some basics of the current process of drug development. In the earliest stages, candidate drugs undergo years of testing and development to evaluate efficacy and potential toxicity through in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal studies. Preclinical animal studies are also used to determine initial human dosing, scaled by relative differences in weight. Before testing can proceed from animals to humans, the drug’s sponsor (often the manufacturer) must then submit an investigational new drug (IND) application. This application includes the preclinical efficacy and toxicology data, detailed protocols for the initial clinical trial phases, and manufacturing information meeting the requirements for “Good Manufacturing Practices” (GMP) – criteria that establish, for instance, a manufacturer’s ability to consistently supply a drug for clinical trials with the necessary quality controls. The FDA reviews IND applications to gauge the risks to research study participants and rejects the application if risk is deemed too high or if there are study design flaws. Once an IND application is approved, the clinical trial process can begin. The table below delineates the four or five clinical research study phases, each of which builds upon the last – if the drug moves on to the next phase. Table: Phases of Clinical Research The most recently introduced phase 0 is not mandatory but is intended to expedite the clinical evaluation of new drugs, for instance by demonstrating that a given drug reaches its intended target tissue. (If a new cancer therapy does not reach a tumor, there is little point in proceeding to studies in a larger population.) The four subsequent phases test drug safety and efficacy, determine dosage, and compare the new drug to placebo or other standard treatments. Early in the process, the focus is primarily on safety, with efficacy and comparison to alternatives taking on greater importance in later phases. Thus, when I occasionally highlight new drugs that are showing promise in early stages (I or II), any results are just that – promising, but not guaranteed to hold up in a more stringent randomized controlled trial (RCT) in phase III. Phase III is the first phase of clinical drug testing that requires comparison to a placebo group – or in cases where it would be unethical to give no intervention, a comparison to the existing standard of care. Some more recent drug trials use placebo comparisons in phase I, Ib, and II testing (for instance, this was the case with the triple receptor agonist retatrutide), though this practice is not required at these stages.1–4 Just as phase 0 is intended to expedite the clinical evaluation of a drug, it may become more commonplace to have a placebo or other comparator groups in earlier phases to preview the drug’s expected performance in the most important phase III trial. Earlier trial phases take years and cost tens of millions of dollars to conduct, but phase III is the one that really matters. Successful phase III trials provide the safety and efficacy data necessary for a drug to then receive approval by regulatory agencies for subsequent commercial sale. After a drug hits the market, data on efficacy and safety continue to be monitored (known as “phase IV” testing) across the populations of individuals using the medication. Where do drugs typically fail? Most drug candidates – roughly 90% – fail at some point between preclinical studies and the conclusion of a phase III trial. The figure below is a broad-stroke visual representation of the estimated success at each phase of drug development, as well as the relative cost as of 2003,5 though more recent estimates indicate that the success rate may be even lower.6 Additionally, note that costs are much higher today than the numbers reported 22 years ago. (To bring a new drug to market costs on average about a billion dollars, so each of these trial phases likely costs about 8-10x more than in 2003.) This figure also does not include failures that occur after a drug receives regulatory approval, as post-market surveillance occasionally reveals previously undetected safety concerns which can lead to a drug’s withdrawal. Though noteworthy, these occurrences are fairly rare – on average, approximately one drug has been withdrawn each year in the US over the last four decades due to post-market safety issues (compared to roughly 30-60 drugs which are typically approved by the FDA each year).6,7 Figure: Stages of drug development in terms of time, money, and rate of success in moving to the next stage. Although the success rate may seem high, this rate is a percentage of drugs that reach clinical testing (Phase 0-1). Thousands of drugs never gain traction beyond preclinical studies. The overall probability of a drug passing all stages was approximately 11% as of 2014.5 In all, drugs failing to show an expected therapeutic effect account for the largest percentage of failures in drug development – between 40-50%.8 Biological discrepancies between cultured cell lines, animal models, and humans make it difficult to validate if a drug is successfully reaching and affecting its intended molecular target. Further, in order for a drug to receive approval, the FDA must deem efficacy to be not only statistically significant, but clinically significant as well. Study outcomes are usually set before the initiation of a phase III trial by the drug company, not the FDA or a third party, and a “successful” study outcome doesn’t automatically mean an outcome with true clinical value. This is also why approved uses are limited to the studied population. An antidiabetic drug that improves glycemic control and induces significant weight loss, isn’t approved for on-label use in treating obesity until an obesity-specific trial is run. Another 30% of failures are attributed to toxicity, either due to off-target effects or the accumulation of the drug in human tissues. Potential risks are weighed against benefits, taking into account the severity and likelihood of a given adverse event occurring, as well as the intended use of the medication, which can shift the balance point of risk to reward. For instance, the level of risk that might be considered acceptable would likely be much higher for a new drug to treat pancreatic cancer than it would be for new drugs to treat headaches or blood pressure. How might we improve? Failures are bound to be a common occurrence in any rigorous system for drug development. But various strategies offer realistic opportunities for improvement in rates of success, as well as in the speed with which we might identify likely failures. By abandoning doomed drugs earlier in the process, vast amounts of time and money might be saved and redirected toward more promising candidates. One proposed improvement involves using a two-parallel-arm approach in the preclinical phase. The most common preclinical studies evaluate drugs’ efficacy and toxicity by their “structure-activity relationship” (SAR), which helps to determine which portion of the drug is responsible for the effect. But the addition of an evaluation of the “structure‒tissue exposure/selectivity relationship” (STR)9 allows further assessment of the accumulation of a drug in its target tissue and in normal, healthy tissues. A drug’s plasma exposure is not necessarily correlated with efficacy, so if a drug is optimized for its molecular target but does not reach the desired tissue, this STR analysis would signal a need to modify the drug structure in order to have the desired therapeutic effects. When testing multiple drug structures, the results of these two study arms create a hierarchy of efficacy and toxicity that potentially improves clinical translation. In later stages of drug development, more widespread use of adaptive trial designs may also help to maintain rigor of the testing process while cutting costs. In such designs, the study protocol is permitted to change as new information – such as preliminary study results – come to light. However, the most impactful advancements will likely arise from the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, which are already substantially accelerating all stages of the drug development process. AI algorithms can sift through large datasets (e.g., “omics” data) to identify novel drug targets or genes and even aid in drug design by predicting the three-dimensional structure of the target molecule. Once a target is identified, AI can screen large libraries of molecules for potential drug candidates as well as generate de novo drug designs. Such an approach might also identify new potential indications for existing drugs, which, as discussed in a recent newsletter, can drastically accelerate the path from concept to approval. Further, AI simulations can be used to predict drug activity and safety, reducing the number of necessary animal studies. The widespread use of AI in drug development has the potential to both lower the cost of bringing a drug to market and reduce the development time. The lower costs of development and AI-enabled drug discovery will potentially incentivize companies to devote more time and resources to developing therapeutics for rare diseases since currently, the high cost of development outweighs any return on investment from a limited market. The bottom line The drug development process has advanced considerably over the last century to enhance rigor. Yet the process is also extraordinarily costly and time-consuming, with plenty of room for improvement with better study designs and the integration of AI. These efforts, in conjunction with changes in business practices on the part of drug companies (as detailed by Dr. Sutaria), may help to curb rising drug prices as well as to incentivize greater attention toward the development of therapies for otherwise ignored rare diseases. Some percentage of failures, even relatively late in the clinical trial pipeline, are unavoidable. Translatability between animals and humans – and even variability in drug metabolism and efficacy across individual humans due to factors such as age, genetics, or body composition – are difficult to predict. This may change with further advancements in AI and computing, but until AI can reliably predict the risks and benefits right down to the level of the individual, phase III (and IV) clinical testing in large, diverse populations are still bound to uncover flaws that may frequently lead to the abandonment of a given drug prior to approval. But even as we seek to reduce the percentage of such failures, we must keep in mind that their very existence is proof that the process is doing exactly what it is meant to do – ensuring a high degree of reliability in the efficacy and safety of approved medications.

Show Notes Mike’s academic journey, and early experiences in powerlifting, personal training, and sports physiology [3:30] There’s going to be some folks listening and watching us who are probably very familiar with Mike’s work and they’ve probably come to learn about him as Peter has through endless years of being both amused and educated by his content on YouTube But there’s probably a group of people here just in my audience that aren’t overlapping with yours Give folks a chance to get to know you, and talk a little bit about your background Mike came to the US from Russia when he was 7 Before that, he grew up in Moscow, Russia In the US, he grew up in the metropolitan Detroit area in a place called Oak Park, Michigan What did you study in undergrad? Movement science, kinesiology at the University of Michigan What sports were you playing then? He wrestled in high school, but he wasn’t very good at it, wasn’t dedicated He got into lifting hardcore towards the middle and end of high school By the time he was in college, he was gearing up to start competing in powerlifting He actually started the Michigan Powerlifting Club A team that went to meets and all that stuff He was a competitive powerlifter in his undergraduate years Peter adds, “For folks who might be confused about all the different disciplines, powerlifting is the sport where there are 3 and only 3 lifts. There’s a deadlift, a bench press, a squat, and you win by having the highest total weights across the three.” So squat plus bench plus deadlift equals total, and the person with the biggest total for the weight class Or absolute or by formula wins the whole thing Mike was not into bodybuilding yet Did you go off and do your PhD right away after undergrad? No, he got a master’s In the exercise science field, going straight from undergraduate to a PhD is very rare Usually you need a lot more preparatory work because the undergraduate curriculum typically just doesn’t teach you a whole lot of applied super specialized exercise science He learned anatomy and physiology very well, but much more general curriculum Especially at an RO1 school like Michigan, they didn’t super hyper specialize He learned almost nothing about sports whatsoever Resistance training wasn’t a big focus there; he must have had 2 bullet points of how to resistance train in any one of his classes It was chronic disease management, health, clinical application Right after undergrad, he went to Appalachian State University to get a Master’s degree under Dr. Travis Triplett and Dr. Jeff McBride That was a subspecialty of exercise science: strength and conditioning So much closer to what he was super passionate about Mike then worked for 1 year as a personal trainer It’s like jail He did a year in Manhattan with his colleague Mr. Nick Shaw, who’s now the co-founder and CEO of their company, RP They trained folks at a private personal training studio in Manhattan (like CTOs of major companies) Mike had never met a truly rich person until he met someone who was worth like $50 million Turns out they’re just really nice cool people that are really chill and have the same problems everyone else does, trying to get in shape In that year, Mike realized he didn’t know enough, and then he enrolled in the PhD program for sport physiology at East Tennessee State University under Dr. Mike Stone That was an amazing time He probably learned more in that 3 years than he ever learned at school Totally immersive Got to work with teams, got to work with athletes, strength and conditioning coach Truly sports science work “We integrate all of the variables, sport coaching, strength and conditioning, sports medicine, nutrition, the whole gamut. Incredible experience.”‒ Mike Israetel Mike got a PhD there and then taught at the University of Central Missouri for a while Taught at Temple University in Philadelphia for a while Then he went full depth into private industry founding RP This happened during the time he was in the PhD program Sometime during the years at Temple, it became apparent that he was more productive not teaching because there was so much to do with the company So he took some time away from teaching Then he came back to teach under his friend Dr. Brad Schoenfeld Who’s the world expert scientifically in muscle hypertrophy Mike taught at his master’s program for a while He left that recently to do private industry full time When did you start putting out these videos on YouTube? Peter only discovered them a couple years ago, but thinks he’s been doing this much longer Mike started posting videos on YouTube in 2020 during peak COVID He records most of his YouTube videos at his home studio If he drops the “C word”, the video guy’s like, “Different take.” They one-take almost everything and that they will roll back The algorithm will flag it and put a COVID warning Mike’s transition from powerlifting to bodybuilding, and his scientific and artistic approach to sculpting muscle and optimizing aesthetics [9:15] Going back to your personal evolution as you’re going through this journey of master’s, PhD, industry, are you still focusing on powerlifting personally? Mike was focused on powerlifting up until he got into the Master’s program Towards the end of undergrad he picked up a muscle magazine at the grocery store Flex Magazine had an issue that summarized the prior 2002 Mr. Olympia contest with all the pictures of the bodybuilders Ronnie won again; that was his 4th or 5th time winning Mr. Olympia and he didn’t look his best Everyone suspected Jay Cutler could have beat him if he showed up that year (He almost beat him in 2001) Figure 1. Jay Cutler and Ronnie Coleman. Image credit: M&F Mike remembers reading the magazine and looking at the pictures ‒ it was enlightening because Mike realized he had an eye for aesthetics Some people will see muscular physiques and they kind of all look the same, like giant veiny, overcooked hot dogs (which is not wrong) Mike looked at the physiques and he was really taken aback, especially by some of them [It was a feeling akin to what] normal people get when they look at very good art: that whoa, I’m looking at something very special, something that’s emotive That’s when Mike started to pursue his own hypertrophy training (muscle growth training) What were you looking like at the time? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Compounding effects of multiple metabolic conditions on cardiovascular risk",
      "content": "The rising tide of metabolic disease represents one of the greatest health challenges of our time. Metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), are each independently associated with elevated risk of numerous other deadly conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. But metabolic disorders are also highly interconnected, with 50-70% of patients with NAFLD also presenting with T2D.1 Given the health implications of these conditions and the frequency with which they co-occur, interest is growing in whether various metabolic derangements might interact in their effects on promoting other diseases. Indeed, a study by Kim et al. recently explored the effects of concurrent T2D and NAFLD on cardiovascular risk relative to each of these conditions in isolation, offering timely insights on a critical question for health in the developed world. What they did The investigators analyzed data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, a single-payer system covering more than 97% of the Korean population.2 This comprehensive dataset allowed investigators to examine nearly 7.8 million participants (mean age: 45.9±13.7) over a median follow-up of 8.13 years to assess associations between T2D, NAFLD, and the incidence of heart attacks, ischemic strokes, and all-cause mortality. Participants were grouped based on T2D status (defined as fasting glucose >126 mg/dL or use of antidiabetic medication) and NAFLD severity, which was calculated using a fatty liver index incorporating triglycerides, γ-glutamyl transferase, BMI, and waist circumference. NAFLD was categorized as grade 1 (fatty liver index between 30 and 60) or grade 2 (index >60). Individuals with existing cardiovascular disease at baseline or a history of cardiac events within one year of follow-up were excluded from the analysis. Cardiovascular risk with metabolic disease Among patients with T2D, the majority also had some degree of fatty liver disease (60.79% vs. 31.22% in non-diabetics), confirming a high co-occurrence of T2D and NAFLD as expected. Also as expected, healthy control participants (those with neither T2D nor NAFLD) demonstrated a lower five-year absolute risk of a cardiovascular event than participants with either T2D or NAFLD, with healthy controls showing a five-year absolute risk of 1.03% (95% CI: 1.02-1.04%) compared to a 3.34% (95% CI: 3.27-3.41%) risk for T2D alone and 1.42% (95% CI: 1.40-1.45%) risk for grade 2 (severe) NAFLD alone. But among participants with both T2D and severe NAFLD, the five-year risk of a cardiovascular event was 4.66% (95% CI: 4.54-4.78%), meaning that someone with both conditions has about a 1-in-20 chance of developing CVD in the next five years. These results thus demonstrate that the risk of a cardiac event with both conditions was higher than with either condition alone. Data on all-cause mortality risk were even more dramatic, as diabetic patients with severe fatty liver disease showed a 5.91% (95% CI: 5.78-6.05%) five-year mortality rate. This risk level was nearly five times higher than healthy controls, who showed a risk of 1.25% (95% CI: 1.24-1.26%). A multiplicative effect These findings might seem obvious — having two risk factors is associated with greater risk than having only one. But upon closer examination, we see that the increased risk associated with both conditions is not merely additive, but rather multiplicative. That is, while severe NAFLD alone increased absolute risk of cardiovascular events by 0.42% and T2D alone by 2.34%, the combination increased risk by 3.63% — roughly 36% higher than the 2.66% expected from simple addition of the risks associated with each condition in isolation. This indicates that T2D and NAFLD have synergistic effects on raising risk of cardiovascular events, a pattern that was also observed even in the context of mild fatty liver disease (grade 1 NAFLD). Grade 1 NAFLD increased cardiac risk to the tune of 1.23% (95% CI: 1.22-1.25%) for non-diabetics but 3.94% (95% CI: 3.87-4.02%) for those with T2D — again, a multiplicative, rather than additive, relationship. Of note, five-year absolute risk also increased exponentially with age. The synergistic effect held true for mortality as well. T2D alone held a 3.68% risk (95% CI: 3.61-3.74%; a 2.43% increase over controls), while severe fatty liver disease alone held a 2.09% risk (95% CI: 2.06-2.12%; a 0.84% increase from controls). If you were to simply add the individual increases in risk from each disease together, this would leave us with a total increase in risk of 3.27%, but recall that the actual risk among participants with both conditions was 5.91% – a 4.66% higher risk than controls. These findings align with our understanding of metabolic disease as a systemic condition with complex interconnections. While this was an observational study limited to the Korean population, it certainly wouldn’t be surprising, given our current understanding of the underlying biology, if these patterns were found to translate to other demographics. The multiplicative effect observed here supports the concept that metabolic dysfunction represents a foundation for several major chronic diseases, with each condition potentially worsening others through various feedback mechanisms. This study adds quantitative evidence to further support what we’ve long suspected: the whole of metabolic health is greater than the sum of its parts. Why this matters for you If you’re living with or at risk for type 2 diabetes or fatty liver disease, this study reinforces the importance of addressing these conditions early and comprehensively. They aren’t isolated problems but systemic issues that are deeply connected, sharing root causes like insulin resistance and inflammation. Further, this study underscores that even mild fatty liver disease can substantially raise cardiovascular risk, especially when paired with T2D. For those without these conditions, the findings serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of prevention. Lifestyle interventions — such as weight management, regular exercise, proper sleep, and blood glucose control (see more in AMA #51 on metabolic health) — can target the underlying drivers of metabolic disease and significantly reduce risk of developing these conditions. By taking action now, you can not only improve your overall metabolic health, but also prevent the onslaught of other health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. In metabolic disease, the adverse health effects of one metabolic condition appear to amplify those of another, creating a compounding risk that exceeds the sum of their individual impacts. But here’s the good news: the same strategies that help to avoid one condition usually help to avoid others as well. By addressing these conditions early with lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, we have the potential to prevent not just one disease, but a cascade of multiplicative health risks.

      "content": "Tom Dayspring is a world-renowned expert in clinical lipidology and a previous guest on The Drive. In this episode, Tom explores the foundations of atherosclerosis and why atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide for both men and women. He examines how the disease develops from a pathological perspective and discusses key risk factors, including often-overlooked contributors such as insulin resistance and chronic kidney disease. He breaks down the complexities of cholesterol and lipoproteins—including LDL, VLDL, IDL, and HDL—with an in-depth discussion on the critical role of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in the development of atherosclerosis. Additionally, he covers the importance of testing various biomarkers, the impact of nutrition on lipid levels, and the vital role of cholesterol in brain health, including how cholesterol is synthesized and managed in the brain, how it differs from cholesterol regulation in the rest of the body, and how pharmacological interventions can influence brain cholesterol metabolism.

Show Notes Defining atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD): development, risks, and physiological impact [2:45] We’re here to talk about ASCVD, cardiovascular disease There aren’t many people who heard our first podcast series together [the 5-part series is listed in the see the “selected links” section at the end of these notes] Peter still gets many notes from people who are just discovering that or who listened to it way back That discussion is a little bit intimidating for someone who’s trying to understand this topic Today, Peter wants to bring a little bit of brevity to what they discussed then and also update people on all the things that have changed in the past 6 years Define what is meant by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) ⇒ That’s a very specific type of a vascular disease, and that means arteries throughout your body acquire a pathology: deposition of cholesterol in the artery wall If you don’t have cholesterol in your artery wall, you don’t have atherosclerotic heart disease We have many arteries in our body and some are much more afflicted than others The arteries of most concern are the smaller ones supplying our heart and brain Because those are essential organs that need a profuse blood flow with all the nutrients and oxygen in the blood The lumen of the cerebral arteries is so small: it’s like the dot of a pencil, so it doesn’t take much to affect the blood flow that’s going through it Over time, with this deposition of cholesterol, 2 things that can happen 1 – It can build up, and the artery lumen starts to narrow-narrow, which would interrupt the blood flow 2 – Probably more often is the deposition of cholesterol in the artery wall, and those collections are called plaque That plaque can become very inflamed and rupture or erode, and that sets off the coagulation system in the arteries, which rapidly cause narrowing or obstruction of that coronary artery Atherosclerosis is the deposition of cholesterol in the artery wall How did this happen? The artery is not over-synthesizing cholesterol Tom’s joke is, “It’s a dump job,” somebody brought cholesterol into that artery wall Peter’s summary Arteries come in all shapes and sizes The largest is the aorta coming off the heart, running up in an arch to supply the vessels of the head and then down into the abdomen where every artery of the body arises It’s not that the arteries of the heart are uniquely susceptible to this process you just described as atherosclerosis, it’s 2 things that are conspiring against us 1 – Very small arteries: it doesn’t take a significant amount of obstruction to create ischemia (a technical term for when oxygen is no longer able to perfuse the tissue) 2 – It happens to afflict an artery that is specifically sensitive to the demands of oxygen Peter remembers explaining this to his daughter’s 7th-grade class He came in to do a dissection, and explained part of the reason we don’t have “butt attacks” and we have heart attacks is that the glute muscles are not quite as sensitive to oxygen, and there were many forms of collateralization Of course, what everyone remembered was “butt attacks” Brain and heart have this issue where tiny blood vessels are very susceptible to collateralization And catastrophic things happen 1 – The gradual occlusion of the arteries is probably what more often leads people to complain of chest pain when under demand Such as climbing the stairs or when at the gym Under normal circumstances, they don’t feel it If they take a nitroglycerine, everything goes away (we’ll talk about why all of that’s happening in a moment) 2 – A plaque ruptures causing complete occlusion of a coronary artery That’s really a frightening scenario The clotting system of the body responds in the way that it should respond when damage occurs For example, if you cut your skin But this turns out to be the worst thing the body could have done This clotting response is what creates a sudden occlusion, and in an ironic way, the body kills itself If that occurs in the wrong part of the anatomy of the heart, that person will be dead within a matter of minutes if an intervention is not performed The brain and heart can’t go very long without nutrients The bigger arteries that are bringing in blood to the brain are pretty asymptomatic until they are 75, 80% occluded At which point those organs are deprived of the nutrients they need This can build up for a long time without you knowing it At least if you report chest pain, you will get diagnosed in time to do something about it ⇒ This is different from a plaque rupture where you’ve got 4 minutes for somebody to dial 911 and hopefully somebody can give you CPR until you can get and take a clot buster The pathogenesis of ASCVD: the silent development over decades, and the importance of early detection for prevention of adverse outcomes [10:45] The timeline of events Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in the US and globally, of both men and women This is largely viewed as a disease of the elderly Does that give us any insight into the time horizon of this disease or the pathophysiology? It clearly does If the deposition of cholesterol is the problem, and you got your cholesterol checked and it’s very high, you don’t have to rush out to see a cardiologist to check your arteries that day, because it takes a long, long time for this cholesterol deposition to occur These are very small molecules The way it’s being deposited in your artery wall: they’re very, very tiny dump trucks carrying cholesterol “It takes decades for this plaque to finally get to a point where it’s noticeable on some diagnostic image. Certainly, it would take even longer for symptoms to occur, and everything. So, it’s a slow-slow process.”‒ Tom Dayspring But we know this is occurring, basically, from childhood on There are pediatric studies (PDAY, Bogalusa Heart Study) where young children have died of this or that, and they get autopsied and they have fatty streaks in their aorta at ages 4, 5, 7, and 8 We know from autopsy studies of military personnel who, unfortunately, get killed in their job, that these young men, many of them robust, in great shape, have subclinical atherosclerosis But none of them are dropping dead of heart attacks while they are serving in the military, with rare exception The point is, it takes a long, long time Most of the heart attacks occur after age 40 (in men and women) Tom explains, “We are recognizing now, the real opportunity is to diagnose who might be having cholesterol deposition at a much younger age when we can just arrest it with various modalities.” Peter’s story from medical school (almost 30 years ago) In the 1st year of medical school, the pathology professor asked, “What’s the most common presenting sign of myocardial infarction?” Of course, every medical student put up their hand and went through the litany of symptoms that you might have; chest pain, shortness of breath, left shoulder pain, nausea, etc. He said, “No, it’s actually sudden death.” That was true at the time It’s not still true today, but it’s close ⇒ The last thing Peter read suggested <50% of people’s first MI will be a fatal one Do you happen to know the most recent stats on that? No, but it’s still quite high The majority do survive, but it’s got to be close to 40% that just don’t have that opportunity To think that only 25, 30 years ago, that number was north of 50% The other statistic Peter has shared before, but it always bears repeating ⇒ If you take all of the men who are going to suffer a major adverse cardiac event [MACE], 50% of them will experience their first event before the age of 65 MACE includes heart attack, stroke, cardiac death, etc. That’s a pretty big number And 33% of women in the same boat will experience their first event before the age of 65 Peter adds, “The older I get, the younger 65 feels… I don’t think of 65-year-olds as old people anymore.” 50% of men and a third of women who are ultimately suffer a cardiac event will suffer their first one (potentially fatal) before age 65 This puts in perspective the temporality of this condition Peter’s summary This is a disease that begins at birth This is largely established through autopsy studies where children, teenagers, people in their 20s die for other reasons; car accidents, homicides, war; and in the process of doing an autopsy, we see the early stages of atherosclerosis The evidence is quite conclusive that this is a disease process that might be inevitable to our species, if we live long enough What might separate the people who never get it (or the people who die from something else at old age versus the people who do), simply has to do with the rate of the accelerator and the rate of the brake application, vis-à-vis, these modifiable and non-modifiable risks Tom’s addendum on how early this can start There are fetal autopsy studies in mothers who have familial hypercholesterolemia, and when they look at the little fetus’ heart, they actually see the beginning of plaque development Figure 1. Lipid accumulation in fetal aortas. It occurs early, and this is why pediatric guidelines have now at least encouraged lipid testing in the pediatric age group, probably age 8 or 9 You don’t wait until you are 40 or 50 Even though we can still help that patient We are moving into what’s called “primordial prevention” ‒ discover the risk factors early, and whatever ones you can modify earlier rather than later is the time to do it {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Unlocking the potential of migraine medications for endometriosis treatment",
      "content": "For the estimated 10% of women of reproductive age suffering from endometriosis – a condition characterized by painful inflammatory lesions outside the uterus – current treatments, primarily hormonal therapies and surgery, are not completely effective.1 In fact, an estimated one-quarter to one-third of endometriosis patients do not find adequate relief from hormonal treatment.2 The search for effective treatments can be frustratingly slow, as the path from drug discovery to FDA approval is notoriously long and expensive – often taking 12-15 years from the initial idea to an on-the-market product and potentially costing over $1 billion.3 However, a recent study by Fattori et al. offers hope that drugs which are already FDA-approved for treating migraines may also prove to be an effective treatment for endometriosis.4 A mechanistic look into endometriosis Fattori et al. performed experiments in mice to investigate the signaling pathways involved in endometriosis, focusing their efforts on a pathway involving calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide released by pain-sensing nerve fibers, and its receptor, RAMP1. CGRP and RAMP1 have long been recognized as having key roles in migraines, and because migraines are a common comorbidity of endometriosis, the authors hypothesized that this signaling pathway might mediate the pain associated with both conditions. Therefore, they sought to characterize CGRP’s involvement in endometriosis in the hope that existing anti-CGRP migraine drugs might perhaps prove useful in treating endometriosis as well.4 After first confirming that CGRP-positive nerve fibers were present in both human endometriosis lesions and lesions from a mouse model of endometriosis, the investigators found that selectively killing these pain-sensing CGRP fibers in mice significantly reduced pain. Specifically, they showed that animals in which CGRP fibers had been destroyed demonstrated reduced sensitivity to painful stimuli relative to control animals with intact nerve fibers, with controls responding to forces nearly four times lower (0.1 grams vs. 0.4 grams) than the experimental group. This suggests that the CGRP-containing nerve fibers are responsible for the pain in this mouse model of endometriosis. Indeed, killing these nerve fibers not only lessened painful symptoms in the mice, it also reduced the size of the endometriosis lesions, a key indicator of disease progression. While the total number of lesions was not affected, ablation reduced lesion size by about one-third (from ~0.6 mm to ~0.2 mm). As such, targeting the CGRP-containing nerves may help not only with pain management but also with stemming progression of the disease itself. Of course, killing an entire class of nerve fibers is a much more dramatic intervention than existing medications targeting CGRP signaling, so to better assess whether results might translate to therapies for human use, Fattori et al. also evaluated the effects of approved anti-CGRP migraine drugs on pain in mice. Specifically, they tested two antibody-based drugs targeting the CGRP receptor (fremanezumab and galcanezumab) and two drugs that act as receptor antagonists (rimegepant, and ubrogepant), and they found that the medications yielded similar benefits as nerve ablation. For instance, rimegepant showed dose-dependent reductions in both spontaneous pain (watching the animal to see if they displayed pain-related behaviors) and evoked pain (applying calibrated forces to determine how sensitive the animals are), along with decreased lesion size. Taken together, this study tells us that CGRP nerve fibers are present in endometriosis lesions and mediate pain associated with the disease as well as disease progression. Further, these experiments show that pharmaceuticals targeting this mechanism offer a promising strategy for treatment. Why this matters The idea that CGRP may play a role in endometriosis is not completely new, but the work by Fattori et al. provides the first clear evidence that CGRP-targeting migraine drugs may help in disease treatment. This would offer a non-hormonal, non-opioid treatment option for patients who cannot tolerate or don’t respond to current therapies. Additionally, these drugs appear to provide dual benefits – addressing both pain relief and disease progression. Still, these tests were all conducted in mouse models of endometriosis, so is optimism for humans premature? We know that animal studies are useful for understanding the mechanism behind disease and serve an important role in assessing safety early in the drug development process. However, when most drugs undergo these preliminary animal tests, clinical utility of the results for humans is still years or even decades away. The vast majority of drugs showing success in animals never make it to market at all and die in early phases of clinical trials. So why are we bothering to report on Fattori et al.’s results if the road ahead is so long and carries such a high risk of disappointment? The answer lies in a handy shortcut known as drug repurposing. Drug repurposing, or using existing approved medications for new conditions, can dramatically accelerate the path to treatment for patients. Since these medications have already passed safety trials, have already received FDA approval for migraine indications, and are already on the market, they could move much more quickly through clinical trials for the new indication of endometriosis than a completely novel drug. As one example, rimegepant has a well-known safety profile, with the most commonly reported side effect being nausea (2.7% vs. 0.8% with placebo), according to the manufacturer site.5 Yet although prior FDA approval for migraine treatment sidesteps the need for trials demonstrating safety, it’s important to note that it does not diminish the need for evidence demonstrating efficacy for endometriosis (at least in order to receive FDA approval for this indication, though any drug that has approval for one condition might technically be prescribed off-label for others). Fattori et al.’s results are promising, but mouse models don’t always translate perfectly to human disease. Still, with the safety of these medications already known, the amount of preclinical and early-stage clinical evidence needed to move forward with larger human efficacy studies is lower than if the drugs were newly developed. This suggests that a viable human treatment for those suffering from endometriosis may be relatively close, rather than a decade away with marginal chance of success. The road ahead This study highlights the value of mechanistic research in identifying new applications for existing drugs – potentially offering shorter paths to relief for patients with difficult-to-treat conditions. For the millions suffering from endometriosis, particularly those who have exhausted current treatment options, this research offers hope for faster access to a potentially effective new(ish) therapy. While we await clinical trials, physicians might consider these medications for off-label use in patients who have failed conventional treatments. But Fattori et al.’s data have caught a substantial amount of attention in the scientific and medical community, so with any luck, human data won’t be far behind.

Show Notes The recent rise in public interest in longevity, misconceptions, and the link between healthspan and lifespan [3:45] The rising interest in longevity, misconceptions, and the link between healthspan and lifespan The term longevity is clearly at a peak in terms of public interest The number of times “longevity” is searched on Google is similar to “Bitcoin” All of today’s guests have devoted decades to studying longevity Why are people so interested in longevity? Is there a bubble going on? Steve Austad It’s a surprise that longevity has become so big, because for a long time we tried to move away from that in the aging field because we were worried that people were thinking of longevity as we’re going to keep frail, feeble old people alive longer When really what we were trying to do is extend health He thinks it’s because there are certain people of a certain age who’ve started to think about their own longevity There’s also a whole new generation of tech entrepreneurs that really feel like this is a problem that will allow them to live healthily for several decades (at least) longer than they are now He hasn’t seen this level of interest before 30 years ago, he would’ve said, “Let’s not even say the word longevity, let’s say healthspan.” That has changed as more and more people have been peeking in at the field from the outside The field hasn’t changed they way they talk, it’s the people eaves dropping on the field that have changed Rich Miller People have always been fascinated for millennia on things they could do to stay alive and healthy as long as possible But there were actually scientific discoveries in the ’90s that showed that it could be done Then in the last 20 years there’s evidence (in mice) that it can be done with pills So that naturally should lead to speculation that there could be pills you could give to people that would postpone poor health for a substantial amount of time ⇒ 20-30% [extension of healthspan] is what we’re seeing in mice, and 20-30% would be very important for people That is one part of it The other part is that there are now people who are making a lot of money by selling stuff that is untested (or useless) to gullible customers People who want to make a lot of money have finally found that there’s an impetus that will allow them to sell stuff, even if there’s no evidence that it works And they control an enormous amount of advertising dollars, both formal and informal That’s a big part of the difference With regard to something Steve said about the balance between healthspan and lifespan It’s become fashionable, for the last 20 or 30 years, to imagine that you get one or the other, that you have to make a choice That it’s a decision, and that if you give up on lifespan that allows you to extend healthspan Rich thinks that’s ridiculous and controverted by all the available evidence ⇒ All of the drugs at least that extend lifespan in mice (and could potentially do so in people) do so by postponing diseases Both the diseases that will kill you (that’s why they extend lifespan) and the diseases that won’t kill you, but which will annoy you and make you very unhappy to be old Peter points out ‒ that’s also true of exercise and not being insulin resistant Healthspan and lifespan are linked together, they go up and down together ⇒ Getting people disabused of that false seesaw metaphor [that for healthspan to go up, lifespan goes down, and visa versa] is an important goal for the public interface between longevity scientists, aging scientists 15 years ago the first ITP was published showing the overwhelmingly surprising and positive results of rapamycin After a decade-long lag, those results were repeated Cynthia Kenyon’s work was published in ‘93, and this may have been the thin edge of the wedge into the idea that lifespan was malleable Albeit through a genetic manipulation in a less relevant model Thinking about this lag, do you buy Steve’s argument that it’s a confluence of technology, tech entrepreneurs? Rich answers the first question: why the lag? There’s a whole batch of important reasons 1 – The prevailing attitude about aging is there’s nothing you can do about it I’m not going to outwit aging, though maybe I can be healthier in my older years “The notion that aging is not malleable, though wrong and provably wrong, is still the overwhelming opinion even of reasonably educated scientists and certainly of the lay public.” ‒ Richard Miller 2 – Commercially, there are companies that make a ton of money selling stuff that doesn’t work by pretending, with a wink and a nod and a lawyer, that it might slow the aging process down And since they can make a lot of money, they don’t actually have to spend valuable marketing dollars on doing research and stuff to prove that it works The long road to developing a longevity drug In the hands of the ITP (Interventions Testing Program), for some of the drugs, the patent is owned by another company Or they’re out of patent Or it’s a natural product None of that says take me to whoever owns a big pharmaceutical firm Even if you want to do it right and you’ve got a very large budget, it’s not an overnight kind of thing For the half a dozen drugs that have been shown to work in the ITP (in mice), finding something in the same family that works really well for people (and is safe) is not trivial Of which rapamycin is the leading agent That takes a long time and it takes a commitment of money and time and effort and intellectual resources, and so far it has not been enormously successful (unfortunately) Steve Austad, “Can I push back a little on what Rich said about healthspan versus lifespan?” Several papers have come out recently showing that the gap between healthspan and lifespan in people is actually increasing It’s increasing the fastest in the United States It’s increasing faster among women than men In humans this is a very real gap and it’s a growing gap In the area of geroscience (the stuff that we do), Rich is right We don’t see this in our experimental systems To Steve, this emphasizes the fact that we need to change the focus One of the reasons that the gap exists is we’re getting better and better and better at treating heart disease and cancer and all these things Keeping people alive when they wouldn’t have been alive 10 years ago This is a really important factor when thinking of public health globally Matt Kaeberlein Thinks both Rich and Steve are right, but looking at it from different angles Steve pointed out that you can make people live longer when they’re sick What Rich is saying (and Matt agrees with) is that if we target the biology of aging, he hasn’t seen anything to make him believe that you can separate healthspan and lifespan Meaning he hasn’t seen things that slow aging/increase lifespan that don’t also increase healthspan Steve Austad That’s an important point: if we target aging, we’re doing something different than the way medicine is operating now, which is targeting individual diseases after they occur Redefining healthspan, the US healthcare paradox, and separating longevity science from commercial hype [12:30] Peter makes the connection to healthcare spending This came up in a recent podcast with Saum Sutaria [episode #327] talking about healthcare costs One thing that emerged is the sad statistic that among the OECD nations, the US has the lowest life expectancy Which is ironic given that we are spending, on average, about 80% more, and in some cases double what most other developed nations spend on healthcare So how do you reconcile this? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Sleepless nights? Try boosting your physical activity level",
      "content": "Surveys indicate that up to 12% of Americans suffer from chronic insomnia. While effective treatment in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a solution for some, CBT-I can be time- and cost-intensive and doesn’t work for everyone as a standalone treatment. Others opt for prescription-based or over-the-counter sleep aids, but as explained on The Drive by sleep expert Dr. Matthew Walker, these options generally fail in reproducing key aspects of natural sleep patterns, such as deep sleep and REM sleep, and many come with risks to other aspects of health. Recently, however, researchers conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate another intervention for its ability to promote quality sleep – an intervention that offers countless benefits to other areas of health and yet is accessible to virtually everyone and comes with a low price tag: exercise.1 What they did The study sought to determine the effects of exercise interventions on both objective and subjective sleep metrics among participants with insomnia. The investigators pooled data from 19 studies that used exercise alone (i.e., not in conjunction with other sleep interventions) in a total of 1,233 participants who did not have other sleep-related disorders. Included studies varied in duration between four weeks and 12 months. The effect of exercise was compared to inactive controls for four objective sleep metrics measured via polysomnography and actigraphy: total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL, the amount of time it takes to fall asleep), wake after sleep onset (WASO, the total time awake during the night after falling asleep), and sleep efficiency (SEI, the ratio of TST to total time in bed). Additionally, the researchers used data from sleep questionnaires to assess three subjective sleep metrics: subjective TST (i.e., the participant’s perception of their total sleep time), subjective SOL (the participant’s perception of their sleep onset latency), and sleep quality (SQ, how rested participants felt upon waking and their overall satisfaction with sleep). What they found Despite the significant heterogeneity across study interventions, exercise interventions had a small but significant positive effect on objective sleep parameters, as indicated by a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.57). (For a detailed explanation of SMD, see this newsletter, but in brief, this is a summary statistic to assess the magnitude of a given effect in pooled data, with values between 0.2–0.5 indicating a small effect, values between 0.5–0.8 indicating a moderate effect, and values over 0.8 indicating a large effect.) The impact of exercise on objective sleep parameters collectively was driven by improvements in WASO (SMD=0.50; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.86) and SEI (SMD=0.66; 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.06). However, exercise did not improve TST or SOL, meaning that subjects did not fall asleep faster and did not get more total sleep, though they were awake less throughout the night and spent more of their total time in bed asleep. Exercise interventions also had a significant, large effect on subjective sleep parameters collectively (SMD=0.90; 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.19), though these metrics are more susceptible to bias than objective measures. The strongest effect was observed with subjective sleep quality (SMD=1.16; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.61), though subjective TST (SMD=0.69; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.05), and subjective SOL (SMD=0.48; 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.75) also exhibited significant improvements. This indicates that participants felt like they fell asleep faster, slept longer, and were more rested and satisfied with their sleep, even if these sentiments did not align in all cases with objective measurements. Of note, the magnitude of improvement in sleep parameters from exercise interventions was greater with higher exercise intensity (though intensities for all included studies were considered light to low-moderate) and in studies with higher average participant age or a higher proportion of females. Insomnia can be due to age-related decreases in physical fitness, at least partially explaining why exercise intervention may be greater for older individuals. The greater effect in women could likewise be explained by lower average physical fitness in females due to historically lower rates of exercising, and potentially to worse sleep at baseline from hormone-related (i.e., menopausal) deficits in sleep quality. Study limitations It’s not a stretch to conclude that exercise is good for sleep, but efforts to derive more nuanced insights from this analysis are limited by the studies included within it. Criteria for chronic insomnia varied across studies, indicating different levels of severity for insomnia diagnoses, which could affect the magnitude of the effect from an exercise intervention. Similarly, nine of the included studies did not include information about the use of sleep aids, which also could impact the effects of an exercise intervention (either positively or negatively). However, the biggest limitation of this study is the intensity range of the exercise interventions. The controls (no exercise intervention) were assigned an intensity of 0 metabolic equivalents (METs), and the exercise interventions had intensities of 1-4 METs (most studies used 3 METs). This is not how METs are typically represented. Usually, one MET is the amount of oxygen consumed while at rest, so this analysis included exercise interventions of 2-5 METs, oversampling the light end of the intensity spectrum. It’s difficult to call an intensity of 2 METs exercising, as this is the energy required to put away laundry or eat while standing. An intensity of 3 METs would be achieved by walking on a treadmill at 2.0 to 2.4 mph at a 0% grade, while 4 METs corresponds to leisurely cycling at a speed of <10 mph, and 5 METs is the intensity from shooting baskets or kayaking at a moderate pace. Since the majority of included studies were at an intensity of 4 METs, there is limited ability to determine the dose-response effect of exercise intensity on sleep parameters, since sleep parameters very likely improve when the exercise intervention ramps up to an intensity higher than what was tested in the included studies. The limited intensity range also means that we don’t know whether an individual who is very active at baseline might see improvements in sleep by adding more exercise to their routine, though it certainly seems likely that ceasing all exercise would make insomnia worse. The significant heterogeneity between interventions (type of exercise, frequency, duration) makes it impossible to give a specific exercise “prescription” for insomnia. Although exercise may be the last thing on your mind if it’s been a while since your last good night of sleep, the significant improvements in sleep quality at the low range of exercise intensity tell us that if you are not exercising, adding any form of physical activity is likely to improve your sleep. And even if you start at very low intensity, increasing exercise intensity over time may lead to further sleep improvements. The bottom line After a night (or week, or month) of poor sleep, exercise is often the last thing we want to do. Yet although daytime grogginess and fatigue from inadequate or low-quality sleep might seem like reasonable reasons to deprioritize your fitness routine, remaining sedentary can feed the vicious cycle of fatigue and poor sleep. Exercise, by contrast, has been shown to significantly improve sleep quality in people with insomnia. Although more research is needed to determine how exercise and other interventions (particularly CBT-I) might complement each other, exercise on its own is a cost-effective, accessible intervention to improve both objective and subjective measures of sleep.

Growing public interest and numerous listener questions have driven the need for this deep dive. The discussion aims to address: Whether people should be worried about these chemicals. Which chemicals pose real risks. Practical steps to reduce exposure. Challenges of researching this topic This AMA required the most research and effort compared to any previous episode. Peter and his team of analysts dedicated about a month to researching this topic. Preparation involved sorting through an overwhelming amount of incomplete and complex information. It was hard to organize the topic due to: The sheer volume of conflicting data. A lack of clear, definitive answers. Finding Clarity: A night of rest provided Peter with a clearer perspective on how to “land the plane” and present the information effectively. No Simple Answers: Peter emphasized that this is a nuanced and complex topic. Listeners should not expect a straightforward or one-word solution. The discussion is built on 75 pages of research notes, indicating the depth and breadth of the issue. Purpose of the Episode: To help listeners navigate the uncertainty and asymmetry in available research. To define the boundary conditions necessary for making informed decisions. To provide a framework for personal risk assessment and exposure reduction strategies. Peter intends to: Acknowledge the gaps in current research. Highlight areas where more information is needed. Provide guidance without pretending to have all the answers. Goal for Listeners: Equip listeners with the tools to make risk-based decisions for themselves and their families. Offer practical strategies for minimizing exposure while understanding where real risks lie. “The further from the shore, the deeper the water.” Definitions: microplastics, BPA, PM2.5, phthalates, and more [6:30] Microplastics and Nanoplastics (MNPs) Definitions: Microplastics: Plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters. Nanoplastics: Particles smaller than 1 micrometer (µm). NOTE: 1 micrometer is 1/1,000 of a millimeter (Peter misspoke and said meter instead of millimeter) Common Study Classifications: Current research focuses on plastics smaller than 1 millimeter. Abbreviation: Referred to as MNPs (Micro/Nano Particles). Prevalence: Ubiquitous in the environment: Found in water, food (fruits, vegetables, meat), and air. Present on surfaces of produce and within animal products. Bisphenol A (BPA) and Bisphenols Definition: BPA is part of a family of chemicals called bisphenols. Used to produce polycarbonate plastic (rigid plastics). Common Uses: Found in products like Nalgene water bottles, epoxies, and resins. Current Trends: BPA use has declined over the past 15 years. Often replaced by other bisphenols: BPS and BPF. Uncertainty remains about whether these substitutes are safer. Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) Definition: Airborne particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Health Relevance: Particles this small can enter the bloodstream when inhaled. They cross the alveolar air sacs in the lungs into systemic circulation. Sources of PM2.5: Mostly from air pollution (not microplastics). Burning wood and fossil fuels (especially coal) are major sources. Natural gas combustion produces less PM2.5. Microplastics contribute only a small percentage to PM2.5 levels.

      "title": "A nuanced and multifaceted approach to longevity research",
      "content": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have revolutionized modern medicine, offering a means for determining causation – rather than mere associations – in medical therapies and other interventions. When well-designed, they minimize bias and confounding variables and provide robust evidence as to whether a treatment is or isn’t effective in its intended purpose. However, as we move into a more personalized and preventative form of medicine (what I call “Medicine 3.0”), we need to recognize that RCTs, while powerful, aren’t always the right tool for every question. Anatomy of an RCT A properly executed RCT requires several key elements that, while crucial for scientific rigor, can limit their applicability in longevity-related research. By definition, these studies must involve an appropriate control intervention for comparison to the treatment under investigation, and participants must be randomized as to which intervention they receive. But strategies for meeting these two requirements are often constrained by practical considerations. One such practical consideration is ethics. Ethics prohibits randomization or optimal control design for certain research questions, as participants cannot be randomly assigned to an intervention which we have good reason to believe may be harmful. For instance, clinical trials have never been performed to solidify the causal link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer because the body of evidence from epidemiological studies and preclinical data is already so overwhelming that it would be unethical to randomly assign a participant to a smoking intervention. Likewise, knowing the benefits of exercise on health and well-being, we cannot ethically test those benefits by allocating individuals into a control group that is required to completely refrain from exercise for years. In some cases, control interventions can be modulated in such a way that would avoid active harm (e.g., by comparing a high-exercise group to a moderate-exercise group), but as we’ve discussed at length in a past newsletter on the Generation 100 study (which adopted just such an approach), doing so can easily undermine the results of the study. Proper blinding is also essential for creating a valid control group, but not all interventions make blinding possible. To continue with the exercise example, someone will know whether they are exercising or not; you cannot blind them to this treatment. Thus, the treatment and control groups differ not only in the treatment itself but also in their awareness of being treated, potentially introducing placebo effects or performance bias (if participants know the group they are in, they may change other behaviors as a result, influencing the outcome). In other words, any differences in results between groups could arise from the knowledge of the intervention rather than the intervention itself. The same challenge applies to dietary interventions, sleep studies, and many other lifestyle modifications that are crucial to longevity research. RCTs are ideally suited to test the effects of simple, binary interventions, as is the case with most drug studies – a participant is either given the active drug or they are not. But how would we design a control intervention to compare to, say, the Mediterranean diet? There is no “opposite” of olive oil and whole grains. How would we even standardize the Mediterranean diet itself across thousands of participants for years? Even when the intervention is simple and binary, humans are not simple, binary creatures. Human aging is a complex system with multiple interacting variables, and when we study interventions in isolation, we might fail to account for the way different interventions interact with each other. Compromises for saving time and money Due to the logistics and cost of running these trials, they must have reasonable duration, usually no more than four to five years – beyond which the study may become cost-prohibitive. (For example, the Women’s Health Initiative was initially funded for 15 years at a whopping $625 million.) But for many interventions, meaningful impacts on human lifespan or incidence of chronic disease may take decades to manifest in a general population. Thus, researchers must often make compromises with respect to the readouts they choose to monitor and the population they choose to study to keep costs in check. In order to get an “answer” to a given research question in a manageable period of time, investigators frequently forgo direct measurement of the outcomes we care about most – like chronic disease incidence or mortality – and instead opt for metrics that are related to these outcomes but are likely to show the effects of an intervention on shorter timescales. For instance, as I discussed recently with Eric Ravussin, the intention of the CALERIE trial was to evaluate the effect of calorie restriction on lifespan, but rather than continuing the study for decades to determine the average age at which participants died, the researchers monitored numerous metrics that might impact or correlate with lifespan, such as oxidative stress and immune function. The same logic is in play when we encounter trials that track apoB levels or coronary artery calcium (CAC) to make conclusions about how a drug might affect risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE, such as heart attacks or strokes) – the outcomes that are most clinically meaningful. Another strategy investigators employ for limiting the duration of an RCT is to restrict the study population to individuals who are already at high risk for the outcome of interest. Trials on interventions to prevent MACE, for example, are often restricted to patients who have already experienced at least one such an event in the past. Relative to studying a general population, this approach drastically reduces the length of time needed to see a separation in risk between the treatment and control groups, but it potentially limits the generalizability of findings. Moving beyond RCTs for Medicine 3.0 Let’s be clear: RCTs are still the most powerful tool we currently have for determining how an intervention may be causally related to an outcome. We certainly are not trying to diminish their importance, but the limitations we’ve addressed above point to a need for other forms of evidence to supplement RCT-derived insights when appropriate. Evidence-informed medicine must complement evidence-based medicine by intelligently extrapolating from multiple sources, allowing us to fill gaps in knowledge generated from RCTs. For example, epidemiology and observational studies may help us identify interesting questions to ask, while animal and cell studies could help answer questions about mechanisms. Where ethical randomization is not possible, Mendelian randomization studies can be used to reduce the influence of confounders to improve our understanding of observational data. (Mendelian randomization uses gene variants associated with an exposure, like alcohol consumption, as proxies for that exposure. Since gene variants are randomly distributed in the population, it mimics a “natural” randomized trial, minimizing the influence of lifestyle or environmental factors.) To answer the difficult questions that longevity research seeks to address will take a combination of interesting questions, the appropriate study design to answer those questions, and intelligent interpretation and synthesis of these data. Beyond combining evidence from RCTs with that from different study designs, emerging technologies and resources are expanding the capabilities of RCTs themselves to address more complex and challenging research questions. For example, long-term exercise trials have historically been hampered by the difficulty of ensuring adherence to the intervention, yet the use of wearable activity trackers can mitigate these concerns, and likewise, wearables for tracking sleep, blood glucose, temperature, and other metrics can provide rich, longitudinal data about individual responses to interventions in those arenas as well. Machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence, network analysis, and other analytical and statistical techniques can help us identify patterns and interactions that might not be apparent in traditional statistical analyses. Adaptive trial designs that adjust study protocols based on new information can help cut down on the costs and durations of clinical trials without compromising their ability to reach reliable conclusions. These improvements will allow us to answer questions that have previously been difficult or impossible to address. The bottom line RCTs remain our mightiest tool for establishing causation in medical science. However, the future of longevity research requires a more nuanced approach that matches the right study design to the right question. Sometimes that will be an RCT, but often it will require synthesizing evidence from multiple sources and study types. The absence of RCT evidence doesn’t necessarily mean an intervention is ineffective – it may simply be impractical to study in that format. As we move forward in longevity science, we need to become more sophisticated in how we evaluate evidence, using RCTs where appropriate while developing and validating other methodologies where they aren’t. This doesn’t mean lowering our standards for evidence – if anything, it means raising them by requiring multiple lines of evidence converging on the same conclusion. The future of longevity research lies not in replacing RCTs, but in supplementing them with other forms of evidence to build a more complete understanding of how we can extend both lifespan and healthspan.

      "content": "Blood pressure is one of the most significant factors influencing both our healthspan and lifespan. Often referred to as the “silent killer,” high blood pressure (hypertension) can cause extensive organ damage, often without any noticeable symptoms. It is a widespread issue, affecting a staggering one in three people in the world (more than a billion individuals),1 many of whom are unaware of their condition. The consequences of untreated hypertension are severe, contributing to cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, cognitive decline, and even sexual dysfunction. However, the good news is that blood pressure is a manageable condition. Through accurate monitoring and proactive steps, individuals can lower their blood pressure and significantly reduce their risk of life-threatening complications. In this piece, we will explore how to measure blood pressure, the consequences of hypertension, and the interventions available to manage it effectively. Would you like to read the full article?

Show Notes Olav’s unique, engineering-driven approach to endurance coaching [2:45] Last time we spoke really about the most nuanced ins-and-outs of cardiorespiratory fitness [episode #294] For the person who didn’t catch that episode, can you give the one-minute version of what you do and why you’re certainly one of the few people that would be poised to talk about what we’re going to talk about today? Olav’s background is in engineering, and that principle has guided him through his journey in endurance sports (or sports in general) He embarked on a journey 15 years ago of extreme in-depth longitudinal studies on 2 of the arguably fittest athletes in the whole world [Kristian Blummenfelt and Gustav Iden] A large part of that involves technology development simply because he is working at the edge of available information In some cases they have to develop technology to allow them to gain a more granular understanding of why things are the way they are In many ways, he’s an applied scientist Is your laboratory both a CPET lab and a racing environment where you work with triathletes? Yes and no Olav works with a mixture of athletes, between triathletes, cyclists, runners, track and field, to even sailors (which is on the explosive end of the domain and not endurance) Definitions and applications of key performance metrics: FTP, power, anaerobic threshold, and lactate threshold [4:45] We’re going to use a lot of terms today (anaerobic threshold, lactate threshold, VO2 max, FTP). Can you define FTP (functional threshold power)? There are a couple definitions, the original definition of FTP (by Andy Coggan) was to do a 5-minutes all-out effort, have a short pause, then do a 20-minute all-out effort, and then subtract 5% from that to find your FTP Typically that would be your 20-minutes all-out effort minus 5% The reason for that is to try to get a ballpark idea of your sustainable power output over an hour Over the years we have learned that this is not accurate and there have become different ways of doing it Some people do a warmup, then do 20-minutes all-out and subtract 5% (that’s different) Peter used to do a gentle warmup for a hour, do 20 minutes, and then subtract 10% Peter wants people to understand the spirit of FTP and not get mired in the details FTP approximates an energy zone that is more than just an all-out, but clearly less than what you could hold indefinitely ‒ it’s directionally about the highest output you could have for an hour There are different ways to approximate it Olav adds that it’s more important to determine this consistently using the same protocol for comparisons How does FTP differ from another term that is used interchangeably (erroneously), which is critical power? Critical power is determined from doing multiple all-out efforts You apply a reverse extrapolation to figure out the critical power “I like the critical power approach a little bit better.”‒ Olav Aleksander Bu What is that trying to approximate? Critical power is where you try to divide something into 2 zones (that’s an oversimplification) To distinguish between non-severe and a severe state In the same way as FTP is trying to figure out what power you are capable of staying at for a prolonged period Where you get into a territory where small changes have a huge consequence on the duration that you’re capable of holding it Where does critical power typically lie in relation to FTP? This depends a little on how you test FTP How FTP has been used recently had deviated from how the authors originally devised it Normally, FTP would be slightly lower in power output than critical power But this depends on how critical power is defined From a metabolic perspective, critical power sits somewhere between your maximum lactate steady state (anaerobic threshold) and VO2 max Typically, it’s more close to VO2 steady state (we’ll define that soon) Many of these metrics (FTP, critical power) are easiest to think about in terms of cycling because we use power meters. Do the same concepts still apply in swimming and running? Yes For simplicity, it helps to use 1 condensed number such as critical pace Testing this in running and swimming is not too different from what you would do in cycling However, you have access to more granular information that you lose when you call it FTP or critical power If you present only that number, you have taken 2-dimensional information and made it 1-dimensional (meaning that you only look at the Y-axis and you take away the how long you are able to sustain something) When you first do critical power testing, it’s more interesting to know how how far you are able to get over 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 50 minutes And then see what happens the next time you do it for 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 50 minutes It’s quite crucial to understand what’s happening with the different balances in the body Most people think of FTP as a 20-minute power, so it’s even simpler (more condensed) information 2 things can normally happen with training 1 – You increase your general capacity (power and/or capacity are increased) 2 – At some point we are all time limited, and this is where we need to prioritize what’s more important for us: explosive speed or endurance This becomes interesting for how you guide training, understanding what’s happening between different power or pace and durations How do we define anaerobic threshold (AT)? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "A link between antihypertensive medications and fall risk reminds us to take precautions",
      "content": "High blood pressure (hypertension) affects nearly half of all U.S. adults, and we’ve all heard that it poses an enormous threat to many aspects of health. I’ve often emphasized that blood pressure management – with lifestyle modifications and, in some cases, antihypertensive medications – is one of the most impactful moves you can make toward a longer, healthier life. Yet few (if any) medical interventions come without their share of downsides, and as a recent study suggests, antihypertensive drugs are no exception.1 In helping to ward off risks to cardiovascular, kidney, and neurological health, these medications may increase risk of another concern for longevity and healthspan – falls and fall-related injuries. How should we interpret these data, and what can you do to offset this risk? What they did For this retrospective cohort study, investigators Dave et al. examined the association between pharmaceutical antihypertensive therapy initiation and fractures among long-term care nursing home residents (mean age 78; 97.7% male) in the Veteran’s Administration (VA) system. Using the VA’s extensive medical database, the authors looked at data from 29,648 different individuals over a period of almost 14 years. For the treatment group, they used data on patients who initiated new antihypertensive therapy, which was defined as increasing the number of antihypertensive medications taken compared to the previous four weeks. Only patients who then remained on the same number of antihypertensive medications throughout the four-week follow-up were included in the treatment analysis. Thus, the study included patients who started their first antihypertensive medication at the beginning of the data collection point, as well as those who started an additional antihypertensive drug. The authors looked at data from the same pool of patients to find controls, using subjects who met the study eligibility criteria (at least 65 years old, no signs of end-stage kidney disease in the past year, and at least one blood pressure reading within the past two weeks) but did not add a new antihypertensive drug to their regimen during the time period. The authors matched these potential control subjects with subjects in the treatment group who had the same baseline characteristics, attempting to reduce the effect of confounding variables by comparing patients who were similar to each other. As long as they continued to meet the study eligibility criteria, individual subjects could be counted for multiple treatment or control group episodes depending on their patterns of antihypertensive treatment over the almost 14 years of study data. The authors ultimately collected data on 12,942 treatment episodes and 51,768 control episodes (about 4 matched control episodes per treatment episode). The end point of the study was having a fracture (defined as arm fractures requiring medical intervention or any fractures of the pelvis/hip) within 30 days of initiating therapy. What they found Among treatment episodes (i.e., the four weeks following initiation of a new antihypertensive medication), the rate of fractures per 100 person-years was 5.4, while among control episodes (i.e., a four-week period after medication had been stable for at least four weeks), it was 2.2. This translates to an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.42 (95% CI:1.43-4.08) for the antihypertensive group, which means that their fracture risk was almost 2.5 times higher than controls. The patients initiating an antihypertensive medication also had an 80% higher risk of falls requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization (HR=1.80, 95% CI: 1.53-2.13) and 69% higher risk of syncope (HR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.30-2.19). The authors also found an increased number of fractures in subgroups of residents. For example, those with no baseline antihypertensive use had more fractures after therapy initiation (HR=4.77, 95% CI: 1.49-15.32). What do these findings mean? The fact that the same patients could provide data for both the experimental and control episodes is a strength of the study, decreasing the chances that the effects seen were due to unknown differences between a separate experimental and a control group. Of course, this was a retrospective cohort study, so randomization was not possible. In addition, the subjects were 98% male despite the fact that women tend to have a higher incidence of hip fractures, so it’s unclear whether the added fracture risk associated with antihypertensives would be even higher among women than among men. Further, this study looked only at the number of antihypertensive drugs, not specific drug classes or different doses within a class, so its conclusions are very broad and can’t provide guidance about specific medications. Still, these findings are of interest given the importance of mitigating risks of falls, which can be particularly devastating in the elderly. Fall precautions are already the norm in a tightly controlled environment like a nursing home (the population under study in this investigation), so if there is an increased risk in that setting, the risk is likely even higher in a home setting without watchful staff and a carefully designed physical environment. (Indeed, the true elevation in risk even among nursing home residents is likely higher than what the authors reported. Data from patients who increased their number of antihypertensive medications but didn’t tolerate the increase for a full four-week period – for instance, by demonstrating a greater tendency to fall – would have been excluded from the treatment analysis.) But why might antihypertensives lead to increased falls (and therefore fractures) in the first place? It is likely related to orthostatic hypotension,2 a condition that many of us have experienced at one time or another. When you stand up quickly after lying or sitting, your blood pressure can suddenly drop, making you feel weak or lightheaded. In more extreme cases, you may actually faint. Orthostatic hypotension can be caused by numerous factors, such as an aging nervous system (this is one of the reasons that the elderly are at high risk for falls), specific diseases, and alcohol consumption.2 As this study implies, medications are a common cause, too. When antihypertensives do their job of lowering blood pressure, they can contribute to it falling too low when the body undergoes postural changes. Another cause of orthostatic hypotension is dehydration. When a person is dehydrated, blood volume is reduced and blood flow to the brain may become inadequate, especially with changes in body position. Using blood pressure medication safely Do these results mean you should avoid antihypertensives? Absolutely not. More than 75% of adults over age 65 and substantial numbers of adults in younger age groups have high blood pressure.3 While diet and exercise can go a long way in keeping blood pressure in check, antihypertensive medications eventually become necessary for most individuals, and forgoing them simply isn’t an option. As I’ve said many times before, controlling your blood pressure is one of the most important things you can do to improve your healthspan and lifespan. It’s critical to prevent cardiovascular events and mortality, kidney disease, and possibly even dementia and other problems related to the nervous system. (See my blood pressure AMA and upcoming blood pressure premium article for more about the importance of blood pressure and tips on how to lower it.) However, we can (and should) exercise caution when using these medications, particularly just after starting a new antihypertensive therapy. This study indicates that the risk of falls and related injuries is significantly increased particularly during the first month after adding any antihypertensive to your regimen. Though the magnitude of risk elevation was greatest for those starting their first blood pressure medication, even those who had already been on antihypertensives saw an uptick in falls with the addition of a new drug. Thus, anyone starting a new blood pressure therapy – whether it’s the first or fourth drug you’re taking – should be cautious and take measures to mitigate fall risk. Preventing falls Fall risk increases with age for several reasons, including lower limb weakness, vestibular changes, and lower reactive speed – in addition to more prevalent use of antihypertensives. Bone density also decreases, so falls are more likely to result in fractures. As I’ve discussed in a past AMA on bone health, the consequences of bone fractures (particularly in the hip or femur) can become increasingly severe with advancing age. At least a quarter of adults age 65 and older fall each year, and falls are the leading cause of injury in this age group.4 About 100 elderly Americans died each day as the result of an unintentional fall in 2021 (78 per 100,000 population of the elderly).5 Hip fractures can be particularly deadly for older adults, who are more than 2.5 times as likely to die within a year (HR= 2.78, 95% CI: 2.12-3.64)6 and 5-8 times more like to die in the first 3 months following the injury (HR=5.75, 95% CI: 4.94- 6.67 in women, and HR=7.95, CI: 6.13-10.30 in men).7 The greatest thing you can do to prevent falls – starting at any age – is to engage in resistance training to improve bone mineral density and build strength, especially in your feet and lower legs, as well as maintaining ankle mobility and balance. (See my podcast on this topic for suggestions of specific exercises and resources on how to do this.) Additionally, you can adapt your physical environment to reduce fall risk by keeping stairs and floor spaces free of clutter and ensuring adequate lighting in occupied spaces. Pay attention when going up or down stairs, and don’t carry anything that’s large enough to block your view unless you have someone to help. Avoiding dehydration Even for those who are relatively young and devote plenty of time to strength and stability training, an oft-overlooked variable can drastically increase risk of falls and fall-related injuries: hydration status. Longtime readers may recall my own dramatic fall a few years back, when I rose from bed too quickly while in a dehydrated state (following blood donation and a long flight), briefly lost consciousness, and face-planted onto a table. I escaped with a few nasty facial lacerations instead of a fracture, but this incident opened my eyes to the importance of hydration for people of all ages and fitness levels. Symptoms of dehydration can include dizziness, headaches, and feeling lightheaded, progressing to more serious effects such as confusion in severe cases. Back in AMA #33, I discussed in depth the variables that impact hydration status and fluid requirements as well as the best options for staying hydrated under different conditions, such as during exercise versus at rest. But as a first approximation, urine output (rather than urine color) is a good indicator of hydration status and is an easy means of assessing whether you aren’t sufficiently replacing fluid losses on any given day. The bottom line The implications of this study reinforce the link between drops in blood pressure and risk of falls, and thus, they apply broadly to anyone at risk of hypotension or light-headedness – whether from blood pressure medications, dehydration, or other causes. Be extra cautious the first month after beginning an antihypertensive drug, but don’t let that discourage you from using these medications if you cannot control your blood pressure with diet and exercise alone. No matter what age you are, focus on building up muscle strength and bone density, pay attention to your physical surroundings, and stay hydrated. While falls have worse consequences for the elderly, we can take steps at any age to reduce both our current and future risk of falls and fall-related injuries.

      "content": "Trenna Sutcliffe is a developmental behavioral pediatrician and the founder and medical director of the Sutcliffe Clinic in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she partners with families to provide care for children facing behavioral challenges, developmental differences, and school struggles. In this episode, Trenna shares her journey into developmental and behavioral pediatrics, including her pioneering work at Stanford and her expertise in autism, ADHD, and anxiety—the “three As.” She explores the diagnostic processes, the overlap and comorbidities of these conditions, and the importance of personalized treatment plans that address both medical and environmental factors. Trenna offers valuable insights into the changing prevalence of autism, the impact of evolving diagnostic criteria, and the range of therapies and medications available to support children and their families. She also discusses the challenges in accessing care and the critical need for a holistic approach that bridges healthcare and education.

Show Notes Trenna’s passion for developmental-behavioral pediatrics (DBP), and the process of diagnosing anxiety, ADHD, and autism [3:15] Trenna did her undergrad and master’s degree in genetics, then went on to medical school After medical school, she did a residency in pediatrics but ultimately wanted to do developmental-behavioral pediatrics It was a good fit with her interested and passions She did a year in pediatric neurology and then a fellowship in developmental-behavioral pediatrics before moving to California Her interests today primarily revolve around behavioral therapy for 3 things that we’re going talk about: autism, ADHD, and anxiety We’re coming at this through the lens of what Trenna does today Which is running a really large, successful multidisciplinary clinic for children up to 18 years old How are the diagnostic criteria defined, and how does a practicing clinician use the DSM-5 or maybe modify that in the way that they try to come up with a diagnosis? ⇒ Anxiety, ADHD, and autism are all behavioral clinical diagnoses based on checklists of a number of traits and characteristics You need to be working with a physician trained in these conditions who has enough experience diagnosing these conditions Essentially, that person needs to be an expert on what the clinical picture looks like because there’s no biomarkers for any of these conditions That’s the key thing: there are no blood tests, no brain scans to say who has anxiety, who has ADHD, who has autism Trenna explains to families all the time, “I have these clinical boxes and labels and diagnoses in my clinic, and these boxes and are manmade. We create these lists of criteria, but neurobiology in the brain is much more complex than these boxes.” The key thing is to have a clinician who collects lots of data on the child Their traits at home, at school, in multiple environments Talking to parents, getting the history Getting information from people other than parents: using rating forms or talking to teachers and therapists Ideally, we get to see the child in their real-life environments Maybe even observing them in a real-life place like school And then doing assessment in the clinic to collect information about them With that, the clinician decides whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria A list of traits or characteristics described in a book called the DSM ⇒ One of the key things is about whether or not those traits are creating impairment, and that’s a key criteria for any of these diagnoses For example, anxiety We all have feelings of anxiety Anxiety is actually a very appropriate normal feeling that we should all have, but it’s all about how much impairment is it creating, how does it impact function, and impact someone doing their job For a child, their job is to learn and go to school, make friends, practice communicating and interacting with other peers, and be a positive contributor in their community (which is school) So it’s about how these traits impact their function in that job What would you say is the youngest age that each of those could be diagnosed? For autism, we can confidently make that diagnosis as young as 18 months of age Although the typical age for diagnosis is 3 or 4 [years old] In the last 20 years, there’s been 1 or 2 cases where Trenna has made it at 15 months of age because it was very significant and obvious Most often, at that young age, we do wait a few more months to watch how the child develops because kids are moving target With autism, it can be 18 months, 2 years of age Although half of the cases of autism are diagnosed over 6 With ADHD, you can make a diagnosis as young as 4 years of age But from Trenna’s clinical experience, she rarely jumps into the diagnosis with 4- or 5-year-olds because they’re still a moving target She may start behavioral interventions and parenting support but generally waits closer to school age Peter asks, “When you say school, you don’t mean preschool. You mean actual kindergarten, 5 to 6?” Yes, a lot of people will wait till 5 or 6 to really see how that child is evolving, although technically you could make it younger With anxiety, there’s many different types of anxiety There’s separation anxiety There’s something called selective mutism in young kids in preschoolers There’s definitely anxiety conditions in preschoolers Understanding anxiety and ADHD: assessing impairment and self-esteem and identifying anxiety and emotional well-being in young patients [9:45] You said separation anxiety is an example, and anyone who’s been a parent can appreciate moments of that What are some of the other types of anxiety, and how do you look to spot those in kids? “Anxiety is actually a normal emotion that we should all have. So it’s all about whether it’s creating enough impairment.”‒ Trenna Sutcliffe Someone may have generalized anxiety: it’s seen in multiple places as pretty pervasive People can have specific phobias towards dogs or spiders or other things There’s separation anxiety Many toddlers have separation anxiety and that’s very normal It’s about how severe and significant the anxiety is, how pervasive it is, and whether it is impacting function When it’s impacting the ability for a child to go to childcare or preschool, then it’s something we need to help There’s something called selective mutism Children who are able to speak very well and speak well at home or with familiar adults but do not speak and are mute outside of that familiar environment There’s also obsessive-compulsive disorder, where people have obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors Peter notices, “You’ve reiterated it twice now, which tells me how important it is. It really has to come down to this impairment thing.” He points out that all of us could probably read through the DSM-5 and place ourselves in each of these diagnostic buckets The truth of it is to ask, “Which is maladaptive, which is mostly giving me the negative response that is impacting relationships or work or these other things?” Peter likes that framework for kids because you may think that your kid has ADHD but they’re doing well in school, enjoy playing sports, and have friends How would you help a parent navigate that if they think their son, daughter has ADHD What are the impairment-style questions you would be asking to paint the contours of this condition, even if you acknowledge that that kid’s got a lot of energy? Those are great questions because it is definitely a spectrum (there’s a bell curve) We’re all on a bell curve When does it become leaving the average range (the typical profile) and over into what we call a disorder? Trenna adds the caveat, “I don’t like to use the word disorder for these conditions either because I think they’re just learning differences and thinking differences as well.” Questions around impairment, the #1 thing she talks about with families is self-esteem How is it impacting that child’s self-concept, how they see themselves? How is it impacting their relationships with peers? That’s another key one Does it impact social interactions? Does it impact how they connect with peers? Does it impact the feedback they’re getting from peers? How does it impact their ability to learn and access learning opportunities at school or on the playground? Are these traits impacting their ability to fully engage in learning, be successful, show their potential? Trenna emphasizes, “The self-esteem thing is very important to me.” These are all biologic conditions: there’s neurochemicals, there’s genetics involved And for a child to have a biologic condition and be in class and then feel bad because they are worried they’re not doing well enough, and they’re getting a lot of negative feedback from teachers and peers, not because those people are trying to be mean or negative, but they have to constantly remind that child because that child is forgetting things, losing things, forgot to put their name on the piece of paper, completely off task It’s not sustaining attention in a conversation It’s actually avoiding tasks that require a lot of sustained attention There’s a lot of these traits where it’s impacting the child’s ability to be successful day to day at school How do you assess self-esteem? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "The endless possibilities of living well in your marginal decade",
      "content": "Much of the content on The Drive is related to living longer through healthy habits, disease prevention, and cutting-edge geroscience. However, the whole point of living longer becomes inconsequential if you are not physically and mentally fit enough to enjoy the final decade of your life – what I refer to as your “marginal decade.” What constitutes enjoyment in these years will be unique to each one of us; it could mean being healthy enough to continue world travel, or simply being able to get up and down from the floor to play with the young children in your life. This week, we’re spotlighting several exceptional people in their 80s, 90s, and beyond who inspire us by showing what is possible in these later decades of life. The late-in-life marathoner In December 2022, Mathea Allansmith became the oldest woman to complete a marathon at the age of 92 years and 194 days. She finished the Honolulu Marathon in 11 hours, 19 minutes, and 49 seconds. While that feat alone is impressive, it is all the more so when we learn that running was not a lifelong passion for Allansmith. The now-retired ophthalmologist began running at the age of 46, building up from running two miles daily to running in the Boston Marathon six years later in 1982. Allansmith credits her longevity in the sport to a few universal principles: find the physical activity you enjoy and be consistent in doing it, eat nutritious foods, and take life one day (or sometimes one step) at a time. The adventurer Not unlike running a marathon, climbing the tallest mountains in the world requires both physical and mental stamina. In 2003, Yuichiro Miura became the oldest person to climb Mount Everest at age 70, but he hardly rested on his laurels. Miura proceeded to break his own record for the feat twice – first in 2008 at age 75, and finally on May 23, 2013 at 80 years and 223 days old, the world record that stands today. At the time of his 2013 summit, Miura expressed the goal of climbing Everest again at age 90, which would have been in 2023, though subsequent illness and development of a lingering numbness in his limbs has prevented him from doing so. Even still, these concerns did not keep him grounded altogether. At 90 years of age, he reached the summit of Mt Fuji, the tallest peak in Japan, facilitated by a support team and a special wheelchair meant for mountain climbing. Even though Miura has made it to the mountaintop many times, he still expresses awe at the experience and the beauty of the view. The legend The longest-standing active rider of the Motor Maids, a North American women’s motorcycle club, is a legend in the world of motorcycling. Gloria Tramontin Struck’s family was in the business of selling motorcycles, but it was only by her brother’s insistence that she learned to ride at the age of 16, a skill that she found could facilitate her love of travel. As you can imagine, in 1941 there was quite a stigma for female motorcyclists, but she persevered and has now ridden more than 700,000 miles in her 83 years of riding, including riding in the Alps at age 75. Tramontin turned 99 this past July and isn’t slowing down just yet. She’s hoping to do another cross-country ride from New Jersey to California next year for her 100th birthday. The 90-year-old astronaut On May 19, 2024, Ed Dwight became the oldest person to fly in space at the age of 90 years, 8 months, and 10 days. Dwight, a US Air Force captain who had been the first African American in the Aerospace Research Pilot School for astronaut training, had never been selected for a space flight in the 1960s. After retiring from the Air Force, Ed became a well-known artist and sculptor, and it seemed as though the dream of going to space would remain just that – a dream. However, the aerospace manufacturer Blue Origin offered Dwight the chance to make that dream come true in the form of a short, sub-orbital flight to the edge of space before returning to Earth. When reflecting on the experience, Ed said, “I thought I didn’t need this in my life, but I lied. I really did need it.” This just goes to show that opportunities can come along at any age – we just have to be ready for them when they arrive. The surf Betty Several months ago, I came across this video of Nancy Meherne from New Zealand, a surfer who sums up her approach to life as “You gotta have fun!” – and her joie de vivre is infectious. Nancy may not be setting world records, but she is nevertheless a very impressive lady who proves that living your best marginal decade is all about maintaining the capacity to engage in the activities that bring you happiness. For Meherne, that meant growing “just about every kind of vegetable that she can eat,” teaching music, riding her bike, dancing to the radio, and getting out to surf at age 91. How many people do you know in their 90s who could independently carry a surfboard, walk on a sandy beach, and get in the water (not to mention getting into and out of a wetsuit, which on its own requires a fair amount of mobility)? Sadly, Nancy passed at age 93 in the summer of 2022, but she remains an inspiration as someone who lived exceptionally well up until the last days of her life, remaining active and delighting in the joys of daily life. The bottom line Hopefully, it is abundantly clear that traveling to space or running a marathon is in no way required to have your best marginal decade. All of these inspiring individuals are living extraordinary lives in older age by staying active, having goals, connecting with nature, eating healthfully, and continuing to challenge themselves – concepts that everyone can implement. While it is impossible to know exactly when your marginal decade will begin, imagining what your ideal life might look like at any age can be motivating to start building the foundation for that life today.

      "title": "Using “atomic habits” to reach your health goals",
      "content": "In 2021, I interviewed James Clear on The Drive to talk about his book “Atomic Habits.” The podcast was so popular that we have re-released it around New Year’s Day every year since. This year, we’ve also decided to do a special end-of-year newsletter in which we use specific examples from the past year’s worth of podcast episodes to illustrate how to apply James’s insights across a variety of health and wellness areas. The four steps to developing a habit Your health goals are probably easy to articulate, but your “system” – the collection of habits that you regularly follow — is what will ultimately determine whether you reach them. As James explained on the podcast, a large amount of our behavior (40-50%) is automatic and habitual, and we are building habits all the time whether we are consciously aware of it or not. Forming good habits is an essential part of both my clinical practice and my approach to my own health and life. While our ultimate goal is to change behaviors, we have to start with forming habits. A series of small and easy changes can collectively make a very big difference. The key to James’s advice is to follow four “laws” to incorporate an action into your routine so that it becomes a habit: 1) Make it obvious; 2) Make it attractive; 3) Make it easy; and 4) Make it satisfying. Figure 1. Four Laws of Behavior Change for Developing Good Habits. Credit: radreads.co In this newsletter, we’re going to go through each of these elements and apply them to some of the actionable health advice we received from guests on The Drive over the past year. 1. Make it obvious Cues promoting a good habit should be easy to spot and grab one’s attention. For example, if you want to run each morning, put your running shoes by the door as a visual reminder. Of course, this step requires you to first identify such potential cues. Ask yourself what visual reminders would help you and where in your home, office, car, or anywhere else they should be. As an example, consider our episode on foot health with Courtney Conley, who emphasized that we lose strength in our feet as we age, which can lead to instability and injury. As we discussed in that episode, toe spacers can help to enhance foot proprioception and toe strength, so for those who want to develop the habit of wearing toe spacers, a great first step would be to keep them in obvious places. Put a pair by your bed so that they are the first thing you see in the morning, have a pair right outside the bathroom so you’ll put them on after showering, and/or keep some upstairs and some downstairs. Similarly, we can apply this “law” to weight training. Belinda Beck and I discussed how starting a weight training program can be highly beneficial for older women to stave off age-related bone loss, and for those who haven’t been in the habit of engaging in this type of exercise, an obvious cue would be very helpful in forming such a habit. Do you want to lift first thing in the morning? Put a small weight outside your bedroom door or near the coffee maker. If you prefer to do it in the evening, place a weight near where you keep your pajamas or next to the couch where you relax after work. Cues like this will help you begin to connect the habit with a specific time of day and allow you to incorporate it into your daily routine. 2. Make it attractive We all intuitively know that making something appealing or exciting will increase our motivation to do it. Your social environment is very important in determining how attractive something is, especially in the long term. If your goal is to stop drinking, going to bars with your martini-loving friends is going to make you miserable and undermine your goal. Having an alcohol-free game night at your house, though, can help you to break the association between drinking and fun and offers the added bonus of the anticipation of having friends over. The physical environment is important in developing habits too. If your goal is to eat more vegetables, make sure your pantry isn’t full of tempting junk food and that your fridge is stocked with your favorite vegetable-based snacks. One of the most effective ways of making a new habit attractive is to involve a friend. A woman trying to follow Belinda Beck’s suggestion to do resistance training might find it much more enjoyable to begin the program with a group of friends or by finding a weightlifting club for seniors. As another example, in my discussion with Eric Ravussin, we talked about the advantages of intermittent fasting. Breaking your fast with a friend who is also practicing IF, or texting each other in support as you adjust to fasting hours, can change the feeling of the experience from a limitation to a cooperative endeavor. This can also work with children and pets: a walk can be an opportunity to talk to your child away from screens, and going for a run might be a great time to enjoy the fresh air with your dog. 3. Make it easy Convenience and simplicity make it more likely that you will perform a behavior regularly. James gave an example of a man who went to the gym for six weeks but only stayed for five minutes; he made going to the gym much easier by focusing first on the habit of getting there, without concerning himself with the more intimidating task of working out for an hour. The “two-minute rule” can also be useful when you are getting started: condense the habit you want to start into something that takes two minutes or fewer to do. This feels much more manageable and allows you to gradually build up as each step feels easier to do. In my conversation with Luc van Loon, he stressed how multiple periods of inactivity can result in drops in muscle mass. Consistency of training is important, but it’s hard to keep up when your routine changes, such as when you’re on a business trip. These circumstances might necessitate finding a way to reintroduce convenience and simplicity. If your hotel doesn’t have a gym, bring travel weights you can fill with water so you have them available when you need them. Before you leave home, locate a park near your hotel where you could run or walk so you don’t have to make any effort to figure out where to go once you arrive. Making it as easy as possible to keep up your fitness routine increases the chances that you will avoid gaps in your exercise program. 4. Make it satisfying Tracking your progress and seeing the improvements that come with your new habit will provide a strong motivation to keep progressing towards your goal. After my interview with Olav Bu about VO2 max, I purchased a portable VO2 device and had a lot of fun tracking this metric during various activities. While not everyone may want to shell out the high cost of these devices, it’s a great example of measurement being a good motivator – it interested me and had the added benefit of encouraging exercise so I could monitor my levels. This can be applied to a number of health habits: watching your weight decrease, your muscle mass go up, or your blood glucose levels stabilize is deeply satisfying. Not all progress is easily measurable, though, so short-term rewards can also be an effective way of making change feel satisfying. Imagine buying yourself a new outfit after a month of successful weight training or splurging on a new sound system after redesigning your environment to support healthy eating and keeping it that way for six weeks. However, we must be careful to ensure the rewards are consistent with the overall goals: don’t buy yourself ice cream as a reward for losing weight or a more comfortable couch for becoming physically active. Breaking bad habits Just as it’s important to develop good habits, it’s often necessary to break bad ones. Unsurprisingly, the steps for breaking a bad habit are the reverse of the four laws for developing good ones. Figure 2. Four Laws of Behavior Change for Breaking Bad Habits. Credit: radreads.co On The Drive, Julia Wattacheril emphasized that maintaining liver health is a particularly high priority because we have no way of repairing the liver or replicating its function beyond a certain point. Reducing or quitting alcohol consumption is key to preventing liver damage, including alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). This is a perfect example of how to apply the anti-rules to break a bad habit. We can “make it invisible” by removing alcohol from anywhere that’s easy to see, such as by placing it in the rear of a cupboard rather than on a countertop. We can “make it unattractive” by avoiding bars and parties where everyone around will be drinking and engaging in more alcohol-free social time to sever the association between alcohol and fun in your mind. Perhaps you can even recall a time you got sick from overdrinking or carry a photo of a diseased liver in your wallet. To “make it difficult,” one might lock alcohol in a difficult-to-reach place, or better yet, avoid keeping alcohol in the house at all. It takes much more effort to run to the store than to walk to the next room. And finally, we can “make it unsatisfying” by imposing small punishments for exceeding your desired drinking amount. Perhaps for each drink you have, you have to pay an accountability partner or forgo watching your favorite show. If there is a food that upsets your digestive system, try pairing it with drinking until you associate the bad feeling with the taste of alcohol. Bottom line Setting up good health habits now can enhance your healthspan and likely your lifespan, too. The “laws” we learned from James Clear can help us apply the lessons we learned from the other podcast guests. In our podcasts, we aim to provide you with actionable steps to put the science of longevity into practice. As we enter a new year, think about the health goals you’d like to reach and the “atomic habits” that will help you get there. Happy New Year!

      "title": "Research Worth Sharing, December 2024 Edition",
      "content": "Welcome to another edition of “Research Worth Sharing” – a roundup of recent research that we’ve found interesting and which we hope might provide worthwhile insights to others as well. Rising rates of youth-onset type 2 diabetes Why we are interested: Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), in addition to their substantial negative impacts on quality of life, increase risk of all of the most deadly and debilitating chronic diseases. These effects are alarming enough in light of the relatively high prevalence (~11%) of T2D among US adults,1 but as diabetes expert Dr. Ralph DeFronzo explained in a soon-to-be-released episode of The Drive, rates of insulin resistance and T2D are also on the rise among adolescents – who, to make matters worse, often don’t respond to existing diabetes medications as well as adults do. Thus, this 2023 review – which details more precisely the trends in T2D prevalence among adolescents – caught my attention as a follow-up to my discussion with Dr. DeFronzo, and I share it so that parents like myself might understand that T2D and its associated health complications are no longer exclusively the concerns of adults. What they showed: This review focused on the burden of T2D among individuals under the age of 20, primarily within the US. The authors report that T2D has grown steadily more common in young people in the US since at least 2002 (the baseline for their analysis), with most recent data indicating a prevalence of approximately 0.67% among individuals between the ages of 10 and 19 and 1.04% specifically among those at the upper end of that age group (ages 15-19). These numbers might seem small when compared to prevalence in US adults, yet they represent hundreds of thousands of individuals suffering from a debilitating chronic disease formerly associated exclusively with adults. Indeed, the authors report an annual percent change in incidence of 4.8% since 2002, and note that by some estimates, prevalence will increase four-fold from 2017 to 2050. doi: 10.2337/dci22-0046 Extending donor organ lifetime with subzero storage systems Why we are interested: In the United States alone, over 100,000 patients are currently on waitlists for life-saving organ transplants, yet many (5-6%) die waiting.2 One of the major problems underlying the deficit in supply is the fact that organs only remain viable for a matter of hours under standard storage conditions (ranging from approximately 4 hours for hearts to <24 hours for kidneys). Extending this window would thus potentially save or improve many thousands of lives worldwide. What they showed: A surgical and research team led by Dr. Gerald Brandacher at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine preserved pig kidneys for up to 72 hours at subzero temperatures before successfully transplanting them into recipient pigs and confirming that they retained normal functionality. The kidney was stored at -5°C in XT-ViVo (a non-toxic preservation solution) in a TimeSeal device – both products of X-Therma, a biotechnology company that specializes in preservation of biological tissue. (X-Therma also covered Dr. Brandacher’s achievement in a recent press release.3) In their proof-of-principle report, the investigators note that all four kidneys preserved with the novel system for 72 hours exhibited normal long-term function, in contrast to two control kidneys preserved by standard procedures. Further, the team demonstrated that the system could be used for long-distance organ transport, as a kidney remained viable after multiple transatlantic trips over the course of 48 hours. Together, these developments offer hope that more widespread use of this storage system may help overcome some of the current barriers to meeting the high demand for donor organs. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0001066636.10142.f4 Mortality risk after ovary removal among women at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer Why we are interested: Certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 significantly increase risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Some of these mutations are quite common, and thus, any data that might inform efforts to counteract this added risk are worthy of attention. Yet I’ve also chosen to highlight this study for another reason – it serves as an excellent illustration of the power of two key tenets of “Medicine 3.0”: the importance of proactive preventative measures and the need for personalization. What they showed: In this longitudinal cohort study, investigators evaluated data from 4,332 women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations but no prior history of cancer (mean age: 46.2 years). Approximately two-thirds of these women elected to undergo preventative bilateral oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries). After a mean follow-up of 9.0 years, women who had undergone this procedure were reportedly 68% less likely to have died from any cause than their counterparts who had not had oophorectomies (age-adjusted HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.24-0.42; P<0.001). The risk reduction was stronger among those with BRCA1 mutations (age-adjusted HR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.20-0.38; P<0.001) than those with BRCA2 mutations (age-adjusted HR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22-0.90; P=0.03). Removal of the ovaries results in early menopause, which typically increases risk for other conditions such as sarcopenia and heart disease. Thus, the reduction in all-cause mortality with oophorectomy observed in this study is noteworthy because it indicates that for women at high genetic risk for breast and ovarian cancer, the benefits of preventative bilateral oophorectomy outweigh the risks incurred by the procedure, which likely would not be the case for women at normal risk. In other words, this study exemplifies the importance of individualized risk assessments and preventative measures as a means of extending lifespan and healthspan. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2023.6937 Exploring the “dark genome” as a target for therapeutics Why we are interested: Genes – the sections of DNA that code for proteins – make up only a tiny percentage of our genome. The rest, which is referred to as the “dark genome,” is poorly understood and typically ignored with respect to potential clinical applications. Yet the dark genome is known to include dormant virus-like genetic elements that can, as mounting evidence suggests, reactivate and promote inflammation and genomic instability – which in turn can drive development of metabolic dysfunction, cancer, and other chronic diseases. What they showed: In this Nature Biotechnology editorial, author Michael Eisenstein shines light on a shift in the biotech industry toward greater interest in the dark genome and virus-like genetic elements as possible therapeutic targets. For instance, a subset of these genetic viruses known as human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) appear to be reactivated with aging, infections, and certain tumors. The viral proteins encoded by these normally silent HERVs mark cells as abnormal, which can lead to a potent immune response. In the context of cancer, this may aid the immune system in identifying and destroying cancer cells, and biotech companies are therefore investigating how HERVs might be leveraged in enhancing cancer immunotherapy. On the other hand, when reactivation of virus-like elements occurs in normal cells, it can lead to inflammatory conditions and tissue damage (e.g., reactivation in neurons may lead to the immune system attacking neural tissue). Thus, companies are also devoting resources toward understanding how these genetic elements might contribute to neurological and neuromuscular disorders, and clinical trials are currently underway to test whether therapeutics intended to target HERVs and other genetic viruses might slow the course of diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). doi: 10.1038/s41587-024-02215-1 Vascular dysfunction and age-related losses in exercise tolerance Why we are interested: We’ve all heard (or experienced) how advancing age is accompanied by declines in physical function. Eventually, this decline can impede everyday activities and negatively impact both quality and duration of life. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which we lose our physical abilities is vital for determining how to slow or prevent such a downward trend. Part of the problem stems from the fact that, as we age, we lose muscle mass and strength. But is there more to the story? What they showed: The researchers involved in this study sought to determine whether losses in exercise tolerance (as assessed by critical power, or the maximum effort one can sustain without reaching a point of fatigue) were entirely attributable to losses in muscle mass or if other factors were at play. Twenty healthy, active adults (50% female), split between a young group (age: 24.4±4 years) and older group (age: 63.1±3 years), underwent five consecutive days of exercise testing to assess various metrics of fitness, body composition, and other physiological parameters. As expected, the older group demonstrated 32% lower absolute critical power than the young group, but more surprisingly, the disparity persisted after normalizing results for lean mass, with the older group exhibiting 30% lower critical power than the younger group. These findings indicate that losses in muscle mass do not account for most of the difference in critical power between age groups. By examining additional metrics, the investigators concluded that the decline in power was instead related primarily to impaired blood flow and vascular conductance to the working muscles during exercise. Though these data do not establish clear causal links on their own between vascular dysfunction and critical power, the authors propose that reduced blood flow would limit oxygen delivery and waste removal from muscles and might additionally relate to impairments in muscle quality with age. doi: 10.1113/EP091571 For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama References Statistics about diabetes.

AMA Format Overview: Today’s episode is a more conversational style of the AMA, mixing specific and broad questions. Topics to be covered include exercise, labs, cancer, action prioritization, longevity, books, and other miscellaneous subjects. The importance of grip strength and the best methods for training it effectively [3:45] Grip strength is important probably for a little bit of the reasons that we understand “the drunk under the streetlight problem” Which means the old adage of the drunk guy standing under the streetlight and someone asks him what he’s doing and he says he’s looking for his keys and they ask him if this is where he dropped him and he says, “No, but this is where the light is.” ⇒ So sometimes where it’s brightest is where you end up looking Not to minimize grip strength, but to point out that in the literature, when you are interested in studying the relationship between strength and outcomes, you need an objective measurement of strength to test Outcomes being everything from onset of dementia, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, etc. If your hypothesis is strength is positively associated with, correlates with or even causal towards these things, you have to be able to test it The question becomes, how do you test strength Should we have people deadlift things? If you go through that exercise, you pretty quickly realize that’s probably not a good idea because most people don’t deadlift and technique is pretty important in deadlifting It’s pretty easy for somebody to hurt themselves What scientists have done instead over the years is they’ve tended to study things that anybody can do, even if they don’t do the particular exercise that’s being tested You shouldn’t be testing squat strength or deadlift strength if a person doesn’t deadlift or squat The things that have typically emerged as strength tests are grip strength, wall sits, bench press, leg extension, and sometimes leg press Wall sits are a test of at least isometric quad strength If you don’t bench press, that’s a bit of a stretch Peter adds a caveat, “I don’t think there’s something super, super magical about grip strength. We just have such an abundance of data on it because it’s such an easy thing to test.” The next question: is there something magical about having a strong grip? Partly yes A strong grip in isolation doesn’t really exist There’s really no example where a person has a very strong grip in their hand, but their forearm, deltoids, scapula, triceps, all of these other things are weak A strong grip is a way to test very strong, very stable control through the upper extremity all the way down to the outside world, and that’s a very practical thing Just talk to any person who’s reached an age where they can’t open a new jar of pickles or they struggle to unlock a door or they struggle to carry a heavy plate When your grip strength goes, your quality of life absolutely goes ⇒ Again, grip strength is just a proxy for people who are strong How should you train it? What’s undeniable is the strength of the association Peter is not even going to go into that because the data on the association between grip strength and any and everything, positive warrants, no further discussion ⇒ The more important question: is it causal? If grip strength is just a proxy for health and increasing grip strength does nothing to increase health, then we really shouldn’t be talking about this ‒ Peter doesn’t believe that that’s the case Peter makes an argument for that in Outlive, going through the Bradford Hill criteria and explaining why he thinks there is causality in the association In other words, why is it that increasing metrics of strength and endurance also improves lifespan and healthspan? Not that they are just markers of healthy people who go on to have a better lifespan and healthspan What you really want to do is all of the other things that rely on strong grip Squeezing a little grip squeezer bought on Amazon is not the optimal way to train grip strength Examples of what you want to do are exercises that involve carrying and pulling and hanging Doing a seated cable pull, if you’re doing a pull down Doing a pull-up Doing a farmer’s carry Doing a deadlift Peter doesn’t do very many things that are “deliberate grip strength exercises”, but when he does farmer’s carries, he’s almost exclusively doing that to push the limits of his grip ⇒ 2 of these things that are the easiest for people to test on themselves at the gym with the least amount of equipment are the farmer’s carry and dead hang Peter mentioned earlier, that if you haven’t deadlift before, you probably shouldn’t just start deadlift without understanding the form Goals depend on how extreme you want to go There’s a standard out there that basically says the definition of exceptional strength is being able to walk with twice your body weight for 30 seconds So if you weigh 175 pounds, you should be able to do a trap bar deadlift with 350 pounds and then carry it, walk with it for 30 seconds Obviously that’s a very high standard A more reasonable standard for maybe sub-elite athletes, for a male in his 40s: to be able to carry his body weight for 1 minute is good and for 2 minutes is very good So again, if you weighed 175 pounds, you’d put 175 pounds on a trap bar, you’d pick it up and march with that for one to two minutes For a woman, carrying 75% of her body weight would be an excellent achievement You might discount that by 10% per decade [after age 40] Peter adds, “I don’t think a person should be discouraged if the first time they try to do that they can’t do it. In fact, if you haven’t been doing that thing and if you’re not used to deadlifting and doing a lot of pull-ups and hangs, I would not expect anybody to be able to do that.” You want to work up to that goal without going to maximal effort (build resilience slowly) For example, if a 175 lb. person tried that test They want to carry 175 pounds on a hex bar for at least a minute and 30 seconds Peter wants you to drop the weight on that bar to 150 pounds (25 pounds below that 175) and do 30 seconds sets Do 10 sets at 30 seconds Then, advance weight and or time accordingly, But you to be able to get through those 10 sets such that at the end of the 10 you’re really completely gassed That’s the way Peter likes to see people build strength The dead hang … {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to this entire podcast episode, its extensive show notes, and more premium content?

      "title": "When caution becomes concerning: the relationship between health anxiety and mortality",
      "content": "Concern for our health exists on a spectrum. At one end, those who lack health awareness may disregard advice to lose weight or avoid smoking and may miss opportunities for prevention and treatment of diseases by skipping recommended check-ups and avoiding the healthcare system altogether. It’s easy to see how this lack of awareness can result in poor health outcomes and shorter lifespan. Anyone reading this newsletter is likely on the more health-conscious side of the spectrum, paying closer attention to your body and following health recommendations as best you can in an effort to support early detection and prompt treatment of issues. However, when health awareness crosses into health anxiety, it can lead to excessive worry and hypervigilance that, as shown in a study by Mataix-Cols et al., may actually undermine health and quality of life by fostering increased stress.1 When health-consciousness reaches extremes At the extreme end of the health-consciousness spectrum, health awareness can turn detrimental, evolving into hypochondriasis – a chronic psychiatric condition marked by a persistent and intense fear of having a serious illness. Unlike the proactive use of screenings and appropriate follow-ups, individuals with hypochondriasis frequently pursue medical tests, imaging, and procedures in an effort to alleviate their worry, often with little lasting relief. This anxiety-driven overuse of medical resources does not stem from a balanced pursuit of health but rather from a deep-seated belief that something must be wrong, regardless of test results. For those affected, any reassurance is temporary, and the cycle of fear and medical intervention continues, often placing strain on both the individual and the healthcare system. About the study The retrospective analysis by authors Mataix-Cols et al. sought to identify whether any relationship existed between diagnosed hypochondriasis and both all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality. In other words – was being diagnosed with hypochondriasis associated with higher rates of death in this population? And if so, were they more likely to die of a particular cause? To accomplish this, the authors pulled data on diagnosed cases and controls (ages 6 and above) within the Swedish population from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2020. For each hypochondriasis case included (n=4,129), ten demographically matched controls were added to the analysis (n=41,290). In their analysis, the researchers adjusted for confounding factors like age, country of birth, highest level of education, marriage status, family income, and presence of other psychiatric disorders. Results using this adjusted model demonstrated that hypochondriasis was associated with a 69% higher risk of all-cause mortality than controls (HR=1.69; 95% CI: 1.47–1.93). When broken down into natural and unnatural causes of death, both had increased risk (natural HR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.38-1.85; unnatural HR=2.43; 95% CI: 1.61-3.68). To dig deeper into the particular diseases ailing these individuals, the authors ran the analysis for specific causes (i.e., diseases of the circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, cancer, etc.). For cause-specific mortality related to natural deaths, those diagnosed with hypochondriasis had a 52% increased risk of circulatory diseases (HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.21–1.92) and a 133% increased risk of respiratory diseases (HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.50–3.61). Suicide was the largest contributer to unnatural deaths (HR=4.14; 95% CI: 2.44-7.03). Collectively, these results indicate that higher health anxiety correlates with higher mortality risk, but what might explain such a link? Interpreting these data Health anxiety, like generalized anxiety or chronic stress, may be linked to various detrimental physiological changes. For example, higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol can suppress immune function and lead to metabolic issues such as insulin resistance. In the cardiovascular system, anxiety can increase heart rate and blood pressure via sympathetic nervous system activation (the “fight or flight” response), elevating risks for hypertension and heart disease. These are just a couple of possible ways that prolonged anxiety can impact physical health. Despite the plausibility of the mechanisms, this study has inherent limitations – like all observational research, it can identify associations but cannot prove causation. The findings show a link between hypochondriasis and increased mortality risk, but it remains unclear whether health anxiety directly influences mortality rates or if other underlying factors contribute to this association. Another consideration is the potential for reverse causality, as those who are at higher risk for certain diseases might therefore become more anxious about their health. Individuals with a family history of early mortality may be more prone to health anxiety due to heightened awareness or fear of genetic predispositions, which could amplify their health-seeking behaviors. The study may also suffer from biases in its participant pool. The cohort was limited to a Swedish population, which may not reflect the prevalence or characteristics of hypochondriasis in more diverse global settings. Furthermore, hypochondriasis is likely underdiagnosed, meaning only the most severely affected individuals were included in the hypochondriasis group. This leaves many mild or moderate cases of health anxiety undetected in the general population, and they may even be in the control group. As a result, we don’t know the mortality risks for individuals with less severe health anxiety, which might not impact their health as intensely. Grounded health practices that deliver Let’s take a deep breath and ground ourselves in reality. It’s obviously important to pay attention to your health, but it’s also easy to feel overwhelmed by health concerns or to get caught up in the latest wellness trends. Where do we find a balance? The truth is that there are simple, effective practices that yield great returns for your health and well-being. These practices don’t require extreme measures or a biohacker’s mindset – they’re approachable, sustainable, and often free or low-cost. (See my thoughts on “biohacking” in a newsletter from earlier this year.) Importantly, key habits like regular cardiovascular, strength, and mobility exercise offer immense benefits. Being mindful of eating habits and not being overnourished is another sustainable habit with great returns on investment. Regular health screenings and recommended tests are foundational, as they allow us to catch potential issues early and address them proactively. Being curious, observant, and proactive with your health can lead to substantial positive outcomes without needing to obsess over every small detail. This approach encourages a sense of balance, allowing you to engage in health-promoting behaviors without tipping into excessive worry. But it’s also important to recognize that managing health anxiety or hypochondriasis is not a matter of fault; these conditions are often deeply ingrained and require thoughtful, compassionate approaches. For those with health anxiety, working with a mental health professional can make a significant difference, helping to reshape thought patterns and reduce the need for constant health-checking behaviors. Recognizing when health vigilance becomes problematic can be challenging, as each person has a unique tolerance for how much focus on health feels right. A potential red flag is when health concerns lead to physical symptoms like fatigue or compulsive behaviors or when they disrupt daily activities. Mental health is not only tied to our healthspan but also our lifespan, making it essential to seek support if health anxiety or other mental health issues are interfering with life. Approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for health anxiety are highly effective, offering tools to manage and reduce anxiety over time. Find your sweet spot A balanced approach to health is key. While vigilance can certainly play a role in preventing and detecting health issues early, an overly anxious focus on health can actually be counterproductive. Despite limitations in the study by Matraix-Cols et al., the idea that chronic stress and anxiety affects your physical health is well-established, and the notion that this link extends also to health-related anxiety is entirely probable. Engaging in foundational health practices like regular exercise, mindful eating, and routine screenings offers the best returns for overall well-being without tipping into hypervigilance. For those who find health anxiety to be a persistent struggle, seeking professional support, such as CBT, can be invaluable. Ultimately, taking care of both physical and mental health enables us to live healthy, balanced lives, in which health is a priority but not an all-consuming concern.

      "title": "Evaluating NAD and NAD precursors for health and longevity",
      "content": "When it comes to potential “longevity drugs,” separating legitimate promise from unfounded claims can be a challenging and frustrating task, and the greater the hype, the more difficult it can be to filter out the noise in search of a signal. For one particular therapy, hype (and commercial popularity) has surged over the last several years: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD. Indeed, we would be hard-pressed to overestimate the importance of this molecule for many cellular processes necessary for survival, and declining levels of NAD have been implicated in age-related diseases and cellular senescence. Thus, NAD-boosting therapies – i.e., NAD itself or NAD precursors, mainly NR (nicotinamide riboside) and NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) – have garnered attention for numerous purported benefits, including lifespan extension, improvements in metabolic health, exercise performance enhancement, and others. But do we have evidence that supplementing NAD levels with exogenous NAD or NAD precursors can improve health and longevity? Why did NAD become such a focal point in the conversation about lifespan extension in the first place?

Challenges in Nutrition Research Food research lacks the rigor of medicine, which studies consistent single molecules. See article “Food Can’t Be Medicine Until We Can Research it Like Medicine.“ Variability in food composition makes controlled studies nearly impossible compared to drug studies. High Certainty vs. Low Data Quality Nutrition discussions often show high confidence despite poor-quality evidence. Nutrition stands out as a field where confidence vastly outweighs data reliability. “There is no discipline of science or engineering for which our magnitude of certainty is so high relative to such poor quality data.” —Peter Attia Cult-Like Behavior in Dietary Advocacy Extreme advocates of diets (e.g., vegan, carnivore) speak with unwarranted certainty. Peter finds the dogmatic zealotry in diet discussions off-putting. Peter’s Gradual Shift in Perspective on Nutrition Clinical Experience and Variability In his clinic, Peter observed wide differences in individual responses to the same diet. This highlighted the complexity and heterogeneity of human metabolism. The Body’s Dampening Effects Peter explains that the body attenuates dietary inputs, reducing their impact. If you think of an engineering system, there are some systems where when you put a signal into the box, the box amplifies the signal But then you have the opposite is true where you put something in and it dampens the signal—And in many ways the body is that way with nutrition. A lot of the things that people pontificate about on the margins end up being really not that important Nutrition effects are often minor once minimum energy and nutrient needs are met. Foundational Principles vs. Marginal Adjustments Core factors like energy balance, protein, and essential nutrients matter most. Once you get beyond total energy consumption, our total energy content of the food, total calories, protein content and the essentials within minerals and nutrients, most of the rest doesn’t matter that much—the body’s pretty resilient. You have to hit certain minimums on fat to avoid severe malnutrition and problems that occur there Carbohydrate tolerance is staggeringly variable—You can get away without eating any carbs and still function and you can get away with eating a ton of carbs and still function But beyond those big principles, there’s very little that can be said with high certainty Key Takeaway: Most dietary details beyond the basics fall into low-priority concerns (“fourth and fifth-order terms”) and have little effect on health outcomes compared to the foundational elements. Key health metrics to monitor to evaluate the effects of nutrition [9:30] What measures of health that relate to nutrition can an individual monitor on their own to kind of understand where they’re at, health-wise? Body composition Nutrition plays a huge role in anthropometric data/body composition. Tools like DEXA scans can measure: Lean mass. Body fat percentage. Visceral fat (if the scan is calibrated correctly). These metrics provide a comprehensive nutritional readout. {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to this entire podcast episode, its extensive show notes, and more premium content?

      "title": "A rational look at a sensationalized sugar study",
      "content": "The relationship between early-life nutrition and long-term health outcomes has long fascinated researchers and the public alike, particularly given the alarming rise in childhood obesity rates worldwide. With nearly one in five children and adolescents considered overweight or obese (as of 2022, from the World Health Organization1), understanding the early-life factors that might influence metabolic health has become increasingly crucial. One potential factor may be a sort of “programming” in early life that predisposes a person to having a sweet tooth, leading them to seek out sugary and calorically dense foods throughout life. This could contribute to obesity and the slew of health issues that come along with excess weight. A recent study has garnered significant attention for its suggestion that sugar restriction during pregnancy and early childhood might protect against diabetes and hypertension later in life.2 But before we jump to conclusions about sugar being the dietary villain, let’s examine what this study actually tells us – and more importantly, what it doesn’t. The sweet opportunity for a natural experiment The study leverages a unique historical circumstance: the end of sugar rationing in post-World War II Britain. The abrupt change between wartime rationing and post-war abundance essentially created a natural experiment in which researchers could compare the long-term effects of different levels of sugar exposure in infancy. Indeed, with the end of the ration, sugar consumption nearly doubled from 41 g/day to approximately 80 g/day. Thus, using a subset of data from the UK Biobank (n=60,183), authors Gracner et al. compared health outcomes between individuals who experienced sugar rationing during gestation and early life with those who didn’t. The findings appear striking at first glance. Those exposed to sugar rationing (i.e., less sugar) during gestation and up to the first year of life showed a 25% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) (HR: 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.84) and 15% lower risk of hypertension (HR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.89) compared to those who never experienced sugar rationing. The association strengthened with increased exposure to rationing: individuals who experienced rationing both in utero and for up to two years after birth showed even greater risk reductions relative to those who did not experience rationing (T2D HR: 0.64, 95% CI 0.60-0.69; hypertension HR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.84). Interestingly, exposure to less sugar exclusively during gestation (children conceived during sugar rationing, but born after rationing ended) was also associated with decreased risk of disease later in life. More specifically, they showed a 13% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.94) and 8% lower risk of hypertension (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88-0.97) compared to those who were never exposed to rationing. This group also experienced a decreased risk of being diagnosed with obesity (HR 0.69, %95 CI 0.60–0.80 for those exposed to rationing in utero plus up to 1 year of life). From this, it was concluded that early exposure to sugar rationing protected from T2D and hypertension later in life. To strengthen their conclusion, the authors examined other diseases, such as type I diabetes, to gain insight into whether this was due to differences in time trends generally (i.e., more accessible healthcare or improved diagnostics), and saw no effect. Thus, it would seem the culprit must be sugar (or so they say). A spoonful of skepticism While these findings might seem compelling, we need to approach them with appropriate skepticism. As I’ve discussed extensively (refer to my studying studies series), observational epidemiology can be useful, but we must be careful not to stretch the conclusions beyond the study’s limitations. I probably sound like a broken record here, but correlation does not imply causation! Let’s start with what the data do show clearly – (1) there was a spike in average sugar consumption per person when it was de-rationed, and (2) children conceived and born before the de-rationing had a decreased lifetime risk of being diagnosed with obesity, T2D, or hypertension compared to those never exposed to rationing. This is a useful insight, but this is about all that we can take away with any level of confidence. To conclude from these data that increased exposure to sugar in early life per se causes children to develop T2D and hypertension (as the mainstream media has done) is to ignore the numerous limitations of observational data. First and foremost, when sugar consumption increased, overall caloric intake rose as well – there wasn’t a trade-off in which sugar replaced other calorie sources. The authors explored whether similar effects occurred when butter was de-rationed, finding no differences between children born after sugar was de-rationed but before butter was de-rationed compared to those born after de-rationing of both. However, sugar consumption accounted for 77% of the increase in caloric intake, making it the primary driver of the excess calories (~150 total kcal/day total increase from rationed period). In other words, increased fat consumption did not provide a great enough change in total caloric intake for the natural experiment to exist in the way it did for sugar. Even the animal studies cited as “ample causal evidence” of sugar’s harm in early life primarily examine high-sugar, high-fat, high-calorie, “obesogenic” diets rather than sugar specifically, or they test non-nutritive sweeteners and not sugar at all. This leaves an important question unanswered: is the issue with sugar itself, or with excess calories overall? An additional concern is that the conclusions are all based on averages across entire populations rather than data on each individual. We can assume that not everyone increased sugar intake after de-rationing to the same extent, but we do not know if the children who increased sugar intake the most were the same individuals that developed hypertension or diabetes later in life. We only know that people in general tended to eat more sugar (and more calories), and then 50-60 years later people in general tended to have higher rates of T2D and hypertension. Furthermore, the study can’t establish whether early sugar exposure led to sustained higher sugar intake throughout life – a key assumption in the authors’ hypothesis. We likewise have no data on other crucial lifestyle factors (or lack-thereof) that influence diabetes and hypertension risk beyond sugar intake, such as physical activity levels or overall dietary patterns. In short, while the study highlights a correlation between early sugar intake and later disease risk, it fails to establish causality or account for other important lifestyle factors that could influence these outcomes. Spun out of control Despite me harping on the limitations of this study, this doesn’t mean the question isn’t worth investigating. In fact, numerous animal studies have examined how maternal and early-life diet composition affects later metabolic outcomes using rigorous experimental designs. However, the leap from these controlled animal studies to human population-level recommendations requires careful consideration and stronger evidence than what this current study provides. The bigger issue I have in this case is with the sensationalization of limited data. This is a common problem in science communication: the tendency to oversimplify complex findings into attention-grabbing headlines with no consideration of the study limitations. Many outlets have interpreted these results as evidence that sugar exposure in early life programs individuals for chronic disease. This interpretation goes far beyond what the data actually show. The bottom line Rather than viewing this study as definitive evidence for restricting sugar during pregnancy and early childhood, we should see it as an interesting historical analysis that raises questions worthy of further investigation through more rigorous research designs. The present study’s limitations don’t diminish the importance of maintaining a healthy diet during pregnancy and early childhood. However, we should not be making specific recommendations about sugar restriction based on these findings alone. While the relationship between early-life nutrition and long-term health outcomes remains an important area of research, this particular study doesn’t provide the smoking gun against sugar that many headlines suggest. Instead of getting caught up in fears about specific nutrients, the focus should remain on established principles of healthy eating and lifestyle habits during pregnancy and early childhood, such as keeping overall calorie intake within recommended ranges. The key message here isn’t about sugar being uniquely harmful or beneficial during early life – it’s about the importance of maintaining perspective when interpreting observational studies and not letting provocative headlines drive health decisions. As we continue to investigate these important questions, we need to rely on more rigorous evidence before making sweeping dietary recommendations that might unnecessarily alarm parents and pregnant women.

Show Notes The US healthcare system: financial scale, integration with economy, and unique challenges [5:00] Peter hopes this conversation serves as the masterclass on the United States Healthcare System He thinks of himself as someone who tends to get deep into things and then quickly come to an understanding of them But he has been rather unsuccessful in understanding healthcare, and he’s looking forward to how much he’s going to learn in the next few hours We are going to talk about things that people care about Why is it so expensive? Why isn’t everybody covered? Why do we not have the best life expectancy? On average, why do we have horrible life expectancy despite spending twice as much as anybody else? We can’t have that discussion if people don’t understand the system, and it’s a really complicated system Saum is one of the most structured thinkers Peter knows Saum’s framework for understanding healthcare in the US and why we are different than every other country on the planet From a finance perspective Healthcare comprises close to 20% of the US economy The US economy gross domestic product that’s probably $28 trillion That’s 25% of the world’s economy Another way to think about it, that’s almost $90,000 per person in the US We spend $11 to $12,000 per person in the US on total healthcare expenditure $4 trillion of expenditure in the healthcare sector If you added up all of the exports that the United States sends out across all industries, you’re talking about $3 trillion We import more than we export A consumer culture, that’s close to but not quite $4 trillion today Put that in context in terms of how much we spend in healthcare in the US, it’s a huge number “Any discussion about the economy, about inflation, about jobs, you’re really talking about healthcare in many ways… given that it’s almost 20% of the economy.”‒ Saum Sutaria qtk Peter asks, “Do we know that it represents roughly 20% of the workforce as well?” In terms of wages, it probably represents a little bit more than that because the average wage in healthcare is higher than in other areas As healthcare as a percentage of the US economy grows, you can’t have that happen without considering what it does to the rest of the economy That’s going to be an important discussion around US competitiveness, US affordability, US coverage, etc. given the nature of healthcare and healthcare issues today Does it make sense to go back to the 1950s to start with Hill-Burton to start with, and then progress into Medicare and Medicaid? Does historical context give people a sense of what happened after World War II? Overview of how the US healthcare system currently works and how we got here [9:45] Let’s start with painting the picture of where we are today, and then let’s back up and say how did we get here? $4 trillion (just to keep this simple) About $1 trillion of that (1/4th) comes from consumers Some of that is spent on what people contribute to the insurance they procure Some of that we’re spending directly on consuming healthcare, out of our pockets {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?

      "title": "Oldies-But-Goodies, December 2024 Edition",
      "content": "This week, I’m sharing another collection of oldies-but-goodies – pieces from our newsletter archive that address a variety of topics of continued interest to our audience. Some provide additional context for recent or upcoming content; some address frequently asked questions; and some are simply worth repeating for anyone who might have missed them. The world of biomedical science is constantly evolving, but in evaluating what has changed, we like to pause now and then to acknowledge information and ideas that have remained relevant despite the passage of time – a celebration of “aging well,” if you will. Protecting against hearing loss In the few years since this piece was originally published, I’ve increasingly emphasized the importance of preserving hearing. This emphasis certainly reflects the fact that hearing plays a significant role in maintaining independence and quality of life with age, but it has also arisen in light of mounting evidence of a direct link between hearing loss and cognitive decline. Having devoted some attention to this connection in other newsletters and an AMA over the past couple of years, it only seems appropriate to follow up with a reminder of practical recommendations for safe noise limits and strategies for minimizing exposure and consequent hearing damage. Does exercise affect lifespan? I’ve often described exercise as the closest thing we have to a panacea, as the improvements in stability, strength, and cardiorespiratory fitness that come with regular exercise are strongly associated with reductions in risk of all the most deadly and debilitating chronic diseases, as well as in all-cause mortality. Nearly all of the evidence in favor of the many health benefits of physical activity comes from observational data, which, as we’ve seen many times, generally cannot establish causality. This newsletter highlights a first-of-its-kind randomized trial (the Generation 100 study),1 which reported no improvement in mortality risk with moderate- or high-intensity training over standard physical activity recommendations, but despite these apparent findings, the study in fact exemplifies one key reason why we might never gain clear interventional evidence for the benefits of exercise despite widespread recognition of their existence and magnitude. Namely, with such overwhelming observational and preclinical evidence that exercise is necessary for health, it would be unethical to design a trial in which control participants are required not to exercise. In other words, the scientific world is already so convinced of the benefits of exercise that preventing individuals from engaging in it would constitute willful harm. Thus, this newsletter serves as a reminder of both the importance of exercise and that a lack of interventional data doesn’t always mean that causality is still in question. Hyperbolic discounting: friend and foe of goal achievement The human brain is a remarkable product of evolution, but in some cases, certain adaptations that served our early ancestors well have become more problematic for life in the modern world. One such adaptation is a cognitive bias known as hyperbolic discounting, which refers to a hard-wired pattern of bias toward immediate rewards over delayed rewards, even if the delayed rewards are significantly larger. This tendency can easily derail plans for long-term goal achievement (e.g., eat the cake now, or stick to a healthy diet and wait for the bigger reward of seeing a reduction in body fat down the road?), but we can also leverage it to our advantage. This newsletter offers some practical tips for using hyperbolic discounting to help us (rather than hurt us) in achieving our long-term goals – for instance, by breaking them into short-term goals or pre-committing ourselves to the healthier choice in advance – a timely reminder as we navigate the holiday season and new year. Are “safe” levels of air pollution really safe? In light of the increasing size and frequency of wildfires in the US and across the world,2 concerns have grown over air quality and the potential health impacts of airborne particulate matter that arises from these fires and other sources. Thus, we return to this piece from early 2022, in which we consider current EPA recommended limits for particulate exposure and evaluate evidence as to whether exposures below this limit might still increase risk of morbidity and mortality. Finally, though it may be impossible to completely avoid airborne particulates, we provide relatively simple strategies for reducing exposure. New insights on maximizing protein utilization for muscle protein synthesis The vital importance of maintaining muscle mass with age is a common refrain on The Drive and our other content, as is the necessity of sufficient dietary protein consumption in order to stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and avoid muscle breakdown. But researchers had long believed that dietary protein only drove these anabolic responses up to a maximum of approximately 3 hours after ingestion – meaning that an individual would need to consume protein several times throughout the day to maximize MPS. Such distribution is challenging for many (and virtually impossible on most time-restricted feeding protocols). However, a study published last year challenged this limit to protein-stimulated MPS. In this article, we discuss the implications of the discovery that anabolic responses can indeed last as long as 12 hours post-ingestion, noting that the type of protein and the matrix in which it is consumed may be critical variables that allow us to take full advantage of this extended window. This piece is worth returning to as a companion to my subsequent podcast interview with the senior author, Dr. Luc van Loon, and to our recent premium article on recommendations for protein intake and distribution.

      "title": "Shingles and brain health: an emerging link or healthy user bias?",
      "content": "Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is an affliction caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV, the same virus responsible for chickenpox) and is marked by painful skin rashes and, frequently, postherpetic neuralgia, a form of prolonged nerve pain that may last months and even years in the worst cases. These effects alone are distressing and in many cases debilitating, and they alone provide plenty of justification to vaccinate against VZV. But recent evidence suggests that older adults may have an additional motivation for vaccination: the shingles vaccine may reduce risk for Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. Shingles arises from the reactivation of VZV, which can remain dormant in nerve tissue for decades following an initial chickenpox infection. Since the virus impacts peripheral nerves, it can trigger neuroinflammation by stimulating immune responses in the nerve tissue. Neuroinflammation is widely recognized as an important factor in the development of dementia, leading to the hypothesis that viruses such as VZV could raise dementia risk – and thus, that vaccination against shingles might help to counteract this added risk. The association between shingles and dementia Researchers have attempted to establish a relationship between shingles and dementia through several observational studies, with varying success. For example, a 2023 meta-analysis including nine controlled trials and approximately 3 million patients found no association between shingles and dementia risk.1 The pooled data indicate no statistically significant association between general shingles infection and dementia or Alzheimer’s disease risk (RR=0.99; 95% CI: 0.92–1.08 for dementia; RR=3.74; 95% CI: 0.22–62.70 for Alzheimer’s disease). However, herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO), a specific manifestation of shingles involving the area around the eyes, was significantly associated with increased dementia risk (RR=6.26; 95% CI: 1.30–30.19; P=0.02), suggesting that HZO could pose a higher risk than shingles without ophthalmic involvement. (HZO affects 4-20% of people with shingles.2) This may be due to the unique ability of VZV to cause vasculopathies combined with the anatomical proximity to the cerebral arteries. In other words, the reactivated virus can travel to and infect the nearby arteries supplying the brain. Indeed, when controlling for many common risk factors for dementia (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, stroke, and coronary heart disease, etc.), one study found an association between HZO and dementia (HR = 2.97; 95% CI: 1.90–4.67).3 While it seems HZO specifically may impact cognitive function, the current evidence is not sufficient to define a causal relationship between a majority of shingles cases and dementia risk. What about the shingles vaccine? Despite the lack of clear added risk of dementia among those with shingles, it nevertheless seems that shingles vaccines may confer some cognitive protection. In fact, a 2024 meta-analysis of four studies concluded that shingles vaccination indeed was associated with a modestly reduced risk of cognitive decline (pooled OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60-0.96, P=0.02).4 Two new articles support this conclusion. In a paper from this past July, authors Taquet et al. show that receiving the recombinant shingles vaccine (compared to the less potent the live-virus version) correlated with a 17% longer dementia-free period over a six-year follow-up.5 The following month, investigators Xie et al. reported a 3.1% reduction in mild cognitive impairment over nine years among live-virus vaccine recipients compared to unvaccinated controls, which further points to a modest reduction in dementia incidence.6 The astute reader might currently be screaming, “but what about healthy user bias?!” The “healthy user bias” refers to the fact that those who are proactive about their health in one respect (for instance, by getting vaccinations) are more likely to engage in other healthy behaviors, as well, including others that might reduce dementia risk (such as exercising or getting enough sleep), creating a potential confounding effect. Some observational studies have attempted to subvert the healthy user bias with opportunistic study designs. For example, Taquet et al. take advantage of the fact that the live-virus vaccine had previously been the standard but was rapidly replaced by the more effective recombinant vaccine. This allowed them to compare apples to apples (or rather, vaccinated to vaccinated individuals) by comparing those who were vaccinated before versus after the transition. The authors also compare the outcomes in those vaccinated against shingles to those who received vaccinations for other viruses – specifically, influenza and tetanus & diphtheria & pertussis (Tdap) – and found that both shingles vaccines were associated with lower risk of dementia than the other vaccines, suggesting the effect is specific to shingles vaccination. More to the story So it’s settled – right? Maybe shingles doesn’t cause dementia, but the shingles vaccine will protect us from it – right? Not so fast. While the newer studies utilize clever strategies to get around healthy user bias, they are still observational, so we must be cautious in interpreting causation. While it is true that Taquet et al. show modestly reduced risk with shingles vaccination compared to influenza and Tdap, this is just one study. A meta-analysis examining 17 studies including nearly 2 million participants shows a 35% lower dementia risk (HR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.60-0.71, P<0.001), regardless of vaccination type. Considering just the vaccines examined across multiple studies in this meta-analysis, shingles (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.67-0.72, P<0.001), Tdap (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.58-0.82, P<0.001), and influenza (HR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.63-0.87, P<0.001) were all significantly associated with decreased risk of dementia.7 This broad effect lends some support to the idea of nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines. In other words, perhaps being vaccinated (regardless of the type of vaccine), confers an immunological benefit beyond the disease it prevents. Double clicking on that idea, note that vaccines are designed to protect against specific infections, but some research suggests they may have unexpected nonspecific effects that enhance the immune system’s ability to fight other diseases. For example, the BCG vaccine (for tuberculosis) has been shown to reduce overall mortality rates more than would be expected based on their protection against the targeted infections alone. This broader effect is thought to occur through two primary mechanisms: trained immunity and cross-reactive immunity. Trained immunity strengthens the innate immune system – the body’s first line of defense – by triggering cellular changes that enhance the ability to combat a wide array of pathogens. Cross-reactive immunity, on the other hand, primes adaptive immune cells, like T cells, to recognize and respond to pathogens that are unrelated to the original target. These combined effects help explain why vaccinated individuals may experience greater resistance to infections beyond those the vaccine was initially designed to protect against. A more robust immune system may prevent cognitive decline by reducing inflammation (a trained immune system can neutralize a threat more quickly, reducing the amount of time the inflammatory process is occurring). The hypothesis that this could prevent cognitive decline becomes more plausible when we consider diseases with neural tropism (i.e., a propensity to target the nervous system), like shingles. Notice I used qualifiers like “may” and “perhaps” in this explanation. It is of critical importance to point out that this is just a hypothesis and that much of the support for it comes from observational epidemiological studies. While there seems to be a reproducible trend of vaccines associating with reduced risk of dementia, we do not yet have sufficient data to support a specific mechanism of nonspecific immunity. In the end, it may indeed be healthy user bias. Should you get the shingles vaccine? For those over 50, shingles vaccination is already recommended and highly advisable for its proven benefits in shingles prevention, yet as of 2018, only 35% of individuals over age 60 get this vaccine.8 The recombinant shingles vaccine (Shingrix) is about 97% effective in preventing shingles for individuals aged 50–69 and 91% effective for those over 70. Given shingles’ high incidence and severe health implications in older adults, the primary reason to get vaccinated remains preventing this painful condition and its complications, particularly postherpetic neuralgia. While early epidemiological findings on dementia risk reduction are encouraging, it’s best to consider them as secondary perks rather than a primary motivation for shingles vaccination. The research on vaccination and cognitive outcomes remains preliminary and requires further investigation to confirm these potential effects definitively. The shingles vaccine is recommended for individuals who have had chickenpox, as they carry latent VZV and therefore face a risk of shingles. If we are to believe that reactivation of VZV (especially in the case of HZO) is causing neuroinflammation or vasculopathies that lead to possible risk of dementia, people who have never contracted chickenpox would not have dormant VZV and thus would not face a similar shingles (or cognitive) risk. For these individuals, the dementia prevention potential observed in vaccinated individuals may not apply, as their risk of VZV reactivation – and its associated inflammation – is effectively zero. If we are to believe, however, that the vaccine is imparting some nonspecific immunity, those who have not had chickenpox may still benefit from the vaccine. The current form of the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, is a recombinant vaccine, meaning it contains only a portion of the virus. More specifically, Shingrix contains a protein from the varicella zoster virus. This is in contrast to an older version of a shingles vaccine, Zostavax, a live attenuated vaccine (i.e., a weakened version of VZV). By including only a protein from VZV, Shingrix is not infectious. Because the vaccine will inherently prompt a strong immune response, there are several likely side effects (injection site reaction, fever, nausea, muscle pain, fatigue) that resolve within days of receiving the vaccine. The recombinant vaccine, which more effectively prevents shingles, is associated with more injection site reactions than its live vaccine counterpart; however, serious adverse events are rare, showing no difference to placebo.9 The bottom line While the shingles vaccine’s potential to reduce dementia risk remains an exciting prospect, I have yet to be convinced that it is not mostly attributable to healthy user bias or possibly nonspecific effects of vaccination. If shingles does increase dementia risk (and therefore the vaccine against shingles decreases dementia risk), it seems more likely it is related specifically to shingles with ophthalmic involvement. The vaccine’s well-documented effectiveness at preventing shingles should remain the top priority for older adults considering it (as anyone who has had, or known someone who has had, shingles will agree!). The possible added benefit of delaying dementia onset, while promising, will require more rigorous research to verify and fully understand. (For more on shingles and the shingles vaccine, see also my podcast interview with Dr. Michael Gershon.) In the meantime, consider the vaccine as a valuable tool to prevent the immediate, tangible effects of shingles, with the potential for a welcome bonus in cognitive health as research continues.

The basic science of red light therapy [3:15] Introduction to Light and Wavelengths Light as waves: Light exists as waves, which are generally very short compared to other waves, like sound. Sound waves are relatively long, while light waves are much shorter. Shorter wavelengths mean higher energy: As wavelength decreases, the energy of the wave increases. For example: UV light has shorter wavelengths and thus more energy than visible light. X-rays and gamma rays are even shorter and carry even more energy. Figure 1. Source: Apni Physics Visible Light Spectrum Range of visible light: Visible light spans wavelengths from approximately 380 to 780 nanometers. Different colors correspond to different wavelengths within this range: 380 nm: Violet (shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum) 780 nm: Red (longest wavelength in the visible spectrum) Red light in context: Red light is found at the longer end of the visible light spectrum, around 620-780 nanometers. Red light therapy utilizes this specific narrow range of red light. Red Light Therapy and Phototherapy Definition of Red Light Therapy: Red light therapy specifically refers to light in the 620-780 nm range. This red wavelength is more narrowly focused than white light, which includes a mixture of all visible wavelengths. Phototherapy: Phototherapy broadly includes treatments across the full range of visible light. It may also use near-infrared (NIR) light, which falls just outside the visible spectrum. Near-Infrared (NIR) Light Characteristics of NIR: Near-infrared light has wavelengths between approximately 790 and 1400 nanometers. Unlike red light, NIR is invisible to the human eye. Role in red light therapy: Near-infrared light is often used in conjunction with red light for therapeutic purposes. NIR wavelengths are slightly longer than red light, providing different penetration and effects. Safety Considerations and Visibility Visibility and potential risks: The fact that NIR light is invisible can present safety challenges. Invisible light might carry risks that are less obvious, as users cannot see its intensity or presence. The unique penetration properties of red light [6:00] Penetration Depth and Wavelength Comparison to UV Light: Like with UVA and UVB in ultraviolet light, red light therapy’s effectiveness depends on its penetration depth. See AMA #61 for more Longer wavelengths, like red light, can penetrate more deeply than shorter wavelengths, though with less energy. {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to this entire podcast episode, its extensive show notes, and more premium content?

      "title": "Calming the concern over exercise duration and coronary artery calcification",
      "content": "Whether from grade school health class, decades of television PSAs, or my own oft-repeated refrains on the topic, anyone reading this will be well aware of the conventional wisdom that exercise reduces risk of heart disease. So when a study this year reported that longer durations of physical activity were associated with increased coronary artery calcification (CAC, a marker of atherosclerotic plaques),1 you can imagine the flurry of questions and concerns that followed. But as is so often the case, these findings are less than they might initially seem, so let’s set the record straight. What they did To investigate how the intensity and duration of physical activity (PA) impact the relationship between activity levels and CAC, authors Pavlovic et al. evaluated data from 23,383 generally healthy men (mean age: 51.7±8.3 years) from the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study cohort. Participants had undergone a CAC scan and completed a thorough questionnaire on PA between 1998 to 2019. The questionnaire was designed to assess exercise habits over the previous three months, and using these results, the investigators categorized participants based on their average PA intensity (calculated as total volume divided by total duration and binned as follows: 1 MET; 3 to 5.9 METs; 6 to 8.9 METs; or 9 to 12 METs) as well as their weekly duration of activity (0 hours/week; >0 to <2 hours/week; 2 to 5 hours/week; or ≥5 hours/week). They then analyzed these data to characterize their association with CAC after adjustment for age, smoking status, BMI, circulating glucose and cholesterol levels, and resting systolic blood pressure. What they found As one might expect, results on PA intensity demonstrated that CAC levels (as measured in Agatston units, or AU) was inversely correlated with average PA intensity, meaning that higher exercise intensity was associated with less artery calcification. Specifically, for every one-MET increase in average PA intensity, mean CAC decreased by 3.1% (95% CI: -4.6% to -1.6%). More surprisingly, however, the researchers observed a direct correlation between PA duration and CAC. For each additional hour of weekly exercise duration, mean CAC score increased by 2.4% (95% CI: 1.1% to 3.7%). Further, in comparing higher (≥5 hours/week) versus lower (<5 hours/week) durations as a categorical variable, the authors report that average CAC in the higher duration group were 19.9% (95% CI: 10.1% to 29.7%) greater than averages among the lower duration group. Figure: Mean coronary artery calcium in men as a function of average intensity of physical activity (blue) and total weekly duration (red). Created using data from Pavlovic et al. Pavlovic et al. note that their findings with respect to exercise intensity and duration were independent of each other(Pinteraction=0.246). In all, they conclude that both low intensity and long duration of physical activity are independently associated with elevated CAC, leading to public concerns that exercising too much might in fact be detrimental to cardiovascular health. Another case of misleading correlations So do these results mean that everyone should cut down on their exercise time and only focus on short bursts of high intensity training? Absolutely not. Concerns over “too much” exercise as a result of this study are yet another example of inappropriate causal inference based on strictly correlational data, and once again, closer inspection reveals plenty of alternative explanations for the apparent association. A correlation between weekly PA duration and CAC score does not tell us anything about whether increased PA duration in any way might cause increased artery calcification, and conclusions about causality are even less valid when relying exclusively on a cross-sectional snapshot, as was the case with this investigation. Indeed, a recent longitudinal study by the same research group suggests that such a causal link does not exist, as no differences in CAC progression were observed across different volumes of PA over a mean follow-up period of 7.8 years.2 In that paper, the authors themselves admit that various biases or confounding factors could lead to a discordance between cross-sectional and longitudinal data. It’s even conceivable that a reverse causality relationship might be at play, as those who learn they have a high CAC score might be more inclined to engage in more exercise in an attempt to mitigate their risk of cardiovascular events. Additionally, Pavlovic et al. report the association between exercise duration and CAC as a dose-dependent relationship (i.e., CAC increases incrementally with every incremental increase in PA duration), but this dose-dependency falls apart when we look at the group of participants recording zero hours of PA per week. Mean CAC score in this group (226.9±625.9) was much higher than it was for any other category of weekly PA duration (the next highest being 199.7±566.6, among the ≥5 hours/week group), and the 0 hours/week group also included a higher percentage of individuals with CAC ≥100 than any other group. All of this isn’t even to mention the limited representation of the study cohort (mostly white and entirely male) or the fact that the analyses relied on self-reported PA data, a notoriously unreliable means of collecting information. Biases in reporting, particularly with respect to health-related behaviors like exercise, can significantly influence results from participant questionnaires – and thus, influence the results of the studies relying on these questionnaires. A question of risk and benefit? Still, Pavlovic et al. are not the first to report a seemingly paradoxical relationship between exercise volume and CAC. Some who are reading this may recall an interview I had with Dr. Ethan Weiss, in which we discussed evidence that endurance athletes with high cardiorespiratory fitness often tend to have an unexpectedly high degree of coronary artery calcification. As he explained, such a link might be plausible given the increased shear stress on vasculature associated with extreme exercise, but even at this upper end of activity levels, evidence to date suggests that increased CAC in these individuals is not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality (again, work done in part by the research group behind the Pavlovic et al. study).3 Ultimately, CAC is only valuable as far as it is an indicator of one’s risk of cardiovascular events or mortality – a low CAC score is not an end in itself, but rather a means of ensuring low CV risk. Thus, even if large volumes of exercise do promote CAC progression (again, not clearly established), if this effect doesn’t correspond to an increase in CV risk, it’s possible that the CAC is particularly stable – in which case, the reduction in CV risk associated with more exercise (for instance, by reducing blood pressure and maintaining metabolic health) almost certainly outweigh any increase in risk associated with a higher CAC score. Exercise is still good bet for heart health In all, the results of the present study provide very little meaningful information with regard to exercise intensity or duration and their relationship to CAC, let alone to cardiovascular mortality. While we have focused our critiques on the aspect of the study that has received the most attention and concern – i.e., the results regarding exercise duration – it’s worth noting that they similarly apply to results regarding exercise intensity. (Faulty methodology is faulty methodology, whether results happen to align with existing knowledge or not.) Meanwhile, exercise has many well-established benefits that reduce risk of cardiovascular disease, such as by improving metabolic health, helping to maintain a healthy body weight and body composition, and reducing blood pressure. So on the balance, we have very questionable risks against very clear and substantial rewards. The choice seems obvious to me… For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama References Pavlovic A, DeFina LF, Leonard D, et al.

One approach that has been growing in popularity over the last two or three decades involves emulating the lifestyles of certain regions and populations in which a relatively high proportion of individuals live exceptionally long lives.

Peter wanted to understand how heritable addiction is Meaning how much is this written into the genetic code? It turned out quite a bit according to the heritability data This came up in the podcast with Karl Deisseroth where we talked about eating disorders, depression, schizophrenia The typical way that these twin studies are done is they look at the prevalence of a certain condition in identical twins that were raised apart That’s really the best tool we have to understand how much of a role do genes play? You take 2 people with identical genes raised in a completely different environment, “Based on that, Anna said that addiction is about 50 to 60% heritable… it’s a big enough amount that it can’t be ignored, but it’s not so big an amount that the die is cast.”‒ Peter Attia Meaning just because you come from a line of people who have an addiction to one thing or another doesn’t mean that your fate is sealed Other things that play a role in addiction She described them as nature, nurture, and neighborhood 1 – Nature is your genes 2 – Nurture is how you’re raised 3 – Neighborhood is the environment you’re in If heritability is 50-61%, 40-50% comes from how you were raised (obvious things and subtle things) Are you raised around people that are engaging in a certain behavior? Do you have experiences in life, for example, trauma that might predispose you to certain addictive behaviors? This idea of neighborhood is very important and has a lot to do with anybody who’s ever considered trying to break a bad habit If you struggle with gambling, it’s really hard to break a gambling habit if all your friends are gamblers You either have to get a bunch of new friends or somehow just decide you’re going to hang out with a bunch of people who gamble but not do it yourself Very difficult Why do some people have a certain lock and key configuration for certain addictions? This is another topic that Peter found incredibly fascinating, and we don’t know the answer Peter used himself as an example: he really enjoys alcohol He enjoys the taste but doesn’t think he could be an alcoholic if he tried If you surrounded him with alcoholics, it would never appeal to him to drink in the morning or drink in a manner that would lead to excessive use It’s not clear why that is It’s not moral superiority There’s something in his brain that doesn’t get enough of that cycle from alcohol; it doesn’t work that way for him The same is true with gambling Peter was in Vegas giving a talk a little while ago and had to walk through a casino 25 times to and from where he was going Not to be disparaging of people who are in casinos at 7 in the morning… If someone offered Peter a job to sit in the casino and play blackjack and they’ll pay him a million dollars a month to do this and cover all his losses and he can keep all the winnings He couldn’t do it He couldn’t imaging something less appealing Yet there are people who ruin their lives doing this, why? Similarly, there are things Peter is addicted to that most people would look at and say, “Who could do that?” “This ‘why’ question I don’t think we have an answer to yet. And yet it totally fascinates me. To me, that’s the most interesting question in this space.”‒ Peter Attia How Anna works with clients She’s a psychiatrist, and one of the first steps that she does is a 4-week dopamine fast Which means a 4-week total abstinence from the behavior that one is trying to rid themselves of Peter thinks this 4-week dopamine fast is valuable for any of us that are trying to cope with our own addictions She said that 80% of her patients will feel better after the 4-week fast Now she also noted some of those people need medications to help them through that For example, if a person is trying to do a dopamine fast around alcohol, they may actually require benzodiazepines medically to help with that transition Of course, that’s not always the case We also discussed a woman that was basically smoking pot 24/7 and was doing it because of her anxiety It turned out the anxiety was coming from smoking all that pot, but this wasn’t realized until she was able to abstain from it {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Radical extension of the human lifespan, science fiction or reality?",
      "content": "Humans have long been fascinated with maximizing human lifespan, possibly driven by a universal desire for more time. Average life expectancy at birth dramatically increased in the 20th century, due to improved sanitation, reduced infant mortality, reduced infectious mortality thanks to antibiotics, and preventative treatment of cardiovascular disease. But will the trajectory of rapid lifespan extension continue? A recent study examined the trends in mortality rates from the last three decades to determine if the projected average lifespan at birth is expected to keep increasing at rapid rates in the already longest-lived countries.1 Measuring changes in expected lifespan at birth At the beginning of the 20th century in the United States, life expectancy at birth was about 47 years, whereas by midcentury, life expectancy increased to around 66 years for men and 71 years for women. Life expectancy increased to about 78 years by the end of the century. This 66% increase in life expectancy works out to a yearly average increase of about 0.33 years, the current standard for what is considered radical life extension (a yearly increase of 0.3 years, or 3 years per decade). In the present study, investigators Olshansky and colleagues used the annual age-specific and sex-specific death rates and period life expectancy at birth from 1990–2019 derived from the Human Mortality Database to assess whether the trend of radical life extension has continued in the past three decades. They used information from the eight countries with the longest-lived populations to evaluate trends in life expectancy and the effects of hypothetical reductions in mortality. Also included in the analysis were Hong Kong, a more recent area with a longer-living population, and the United States, which is sadly not among the top countries for life expectancy, but serves as an important comparison. (The U.S., despite its status as a very wealthy nation, saw rising mortality of its middle-age population between 2010 to 2019 and currently has an approximately 8-year lower life expectancy at birth than the longest-lived populations.) What the study found The study found that the annual rise in life expectancy has largely slowed over the past thirty years. The defined 0.3-year annual or 3-year-per-decade improvement in life expectancy was only observed in South Korea from 2010 to 2019 and from 1990 to 2000 in Hong Kong. In most of the observed populations, the most recent decade (2010-2019) had a decelerating annual rise in life expectancy at birth, dropping to below 0.2 years annually for eight of the ten populations. Additionally, most of the included countries only increased in survivorship to 100 years of age by 1-2% over the three-decade period, with slightly higher increases in Japan and Hong Kong, approximately 4 and 6%, respectively. However, none of these trends, even if they continued at the same rate, would lead to a 50% or greater survivorship to 100 by the turn of the next century. The natural follow-up is to determine what magnitude of changes would need to occur to keep raising life expectancy. In all ten included countries, life expectancy has increased since 1990, yet the study estimated that even if deaths of people younger than 50 were completely prevented going forward, average life expectancy at birth would only rise by 1–1.5 years, indicating that the greatest impact on life expectancy at present is not the loss of young lives. Indeed, to keep increasing life expectancy, all-cause mortality (ACM) would have to be reduced at all ages by a greater percentage now than was required to create the same incremental rise thirty years ago. For instance, in current-day Japanese men, a 9.5% reduction in ACM at all ages would be required to raise life expectancy from 82 to 83 years, while a one-year extension in life expectancy of Japanese women, who on average live longer than Japanese men, would require an even larger reduction in ACM – a whopping 20.3% in all ages to raise life expectancy from 88 to 89 years. As these data suggest, as average life expectancy increases, each additional one-year increase requires a greater reduction in mortality, making it more difficult to maintain the standard for radical life extension in the longest-lived nations. This is potentially an explanation for the observed deceleration in life expectancy trends. What does this mean? The timing of the 20th-century improvements in life expectancy varied across the ten included populations, which suggests that the life extension thus far has been largely due to better living conditions and the elimination or treatment of disease – processes which would occur in different nations on different timelines. For instance, the radical rise in life expectancy in Hong Kong during the 1990s is attributed to economic prosperity and tobacco control in that country. Japan also had a later increase in life expectancy in the last third of the 20th century, attributed to economic prosperity and advancements in medical technology, which led to large reductions in infant mortality, reduced cerebrovascular deaths from public health initiatives to lower blood pressure, and more widespread healthcare after they adopted a national healthcare system in 1961. But all of these improvements came from improving survivorship at all ages by reducing disease-associated mortality, not by altering aging-associated mortality – a critical distinction as humanity reaches ever more advanced average life expectancies. To illustrate the difference, consider the analogy of an oak tree: reducing disease-related mortality in an oak tree might involve improvements in soil nutrition and protection from acute events like fires, lightning strikes, and pest infestations. But even with the best protection, an aged oak tree will eventually decline in health due to accumulated stress, reduced wound healing, and less resiliency to normal environmental stressors like droughts or periods of high rainfall. In all likelihood, there is an upper limit to lifespan in all living beings that is determined by the biology of aging itself. Olshansky et al.’s data provide further evidence that we, as humans, are asymptotically approaching that limit. They show that although life expectancy increased, maximum lifespan has stagnated, and lifespan variation declined. Together this means that even though life expectancy is longer, the age at death has been compressed into a shorter window of time – in essence, we’re all crowding closer to the limit, but the limit itself hasn’t budged. Consider this hypothetical situation posed by the study authors as to why current trends are unlikely to continuously raise life expectancy: radical life extension for Japanese females (an increase of 0.3 years for the next 75 years) would result in a 22.5-year increase in life expectancy, leading to an average age of mortality of 110 years. However, this would require that 70% of females live to be 100 and 6% of females live to be 150, nearly thirty years longer than the longest-lived person ever on record! There is no evidence to suggest that humans can live to 150 years of age without sophisticated interventions that challenge the very fundamentals of aging biology, and some models suggest that there is less than a one in 10,000 chance of even living beyond 125 years in any given year.2 However, all of the models and projections are rooted in the fact that there are no human interventions to date that slow the biological process of aging and assume that accumulation of cellular damage is inevitable, leading to declining organ function and eventually organ system failure. The final word on radical lifespan extension? While this study demonstrated that there is a limit to the extension of lifespan by preventing or treating chronic disease via current treatments and their (late) applications, a major limitation of this study is that it cannot predict future advances in medicine or aging biology that would have step-function-like impacts on lifespan (a limitation acknowledged by the authors). A jump in human lifespan could be driven by a single breakthrough or a combination of discoveries in different fields, including geroprotective drugs, genetic engineering, and human-machine interfacing. Geroprotective drugs like rapamycin have demonstrated in the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) an increase in the total lifespan of the longest-lived mice by 9-14% as well as an overall increase in median survival.3 While that bump in lifespan alone might not be enough to help a human live beyond 125 years, proof-of-concept studies in genetic engineering have demonstrated significant increases in lifespan in simple organisms, such as yeast and worms. Although humans are far more complex creatures, it is not unreasonable to think that it may become possible this century to slow aging through genetic manipulations of specific tissues. More broadly, even the way we think about lifespan may change in the coming decades. With more developments in artificial brains, machine-brain interfaces, and artificial intelligence, it may become possible to “download” our consciousness onto a computer. Right now we define human lifespan as the number of chronological years in one body, but leaps in technology might change how we even define human lifespan itself. The bottom line While it may seem like the study by Olshansky et al. squashes hope of living significantly longer, all this study tells us is that we are approaching the limits of lifespan set by aging biology – but if there has been any unifying theme across the history of our species, it’s that humans have a knack for overcoming limits. It certainly isn’t in our biology to fly, yet to most people reading this, spending a few hours cruising 30,000 feet above land is practically mundane. Even thirty years ago, we couldn’t have conceived of technology as it exists today. Imagine trying to describe a smartphone or generative AI to someone in 1990 – it would seem like science fiction. Likewise, a few decades from now, there may be new therapies that can modulate the biological rate of aging in a way that helps us live much longer and better in ways we couldn’t fathom today. Though in the meantime, our best bet for reducing mortality risk is still exercising, eating well, being social, and getting good sleep, with the goal of staying as healthy for as long as possible within the current bounds of the aging human body.

work metabolism and measuring energy expenditure [3:00] Eric and Peter worked together at NuSI Peter was part of an organization called NuSI, and Eric was 1 of 6 of the principal investigators for a very audacious experiment and part of something called the Energy Balance Consortium, along with Kevin Hall, Steve Smith, Rudy Leibel, Mike Rosenbaum, and Marc Reitman It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to do something that had never been done before, which was a multi-center indirect calorimetry inpatient study that was really aimed at trying to at least pilot what would be necessary to do the definitive experiment to answer a question which has to do with the nature of calories and weight gain For 4 years, they had the pleasure of working together and really getting into the weeds of how one technically tries to measure these things and how difficult it is and all of the challenges and potential pitfalls of this Give folks a sense of your life’s work and your life’s passion Eric has been at Pennington Biomedical Research for 24 years He was the Associate Executive Director for Clinical Science He joined Pennington after spending 2.5 years at Eli Lilly Before that, he was 15 years at the NIH (intramural research) “The reason I came to this country was to build the first metabolic chamber or indirect calorimetry chamber to measure energy expenditure in people over periods of hours and days.”‒ Eric Ravussin Tell folks a little bit about what it means to be intramural versus extramural NIH The NIH budget is about $33-35 billion, but there is a group which is intramural Most of the money (80-85%) goes to all the academic institutions doing biomedical research in the country (extramural research) In intramural research you are an employee of the NIH, you work at the NIH campus, and your funding comes from the organization that you work for Eric was intramural based in Phoenix Arizona He worked a lot with the Pima Indians ‒ they have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the second-highest prevalence of obesity in the world What Eric likes about intramural research is that you are judged after the fact You have a budget and you can do whatever you want, and every 3 years you are judged Whereas extramural, we chase these grants and you have to basically provide preliminary data, hypothesis, and you are judged before doing the study Eric thinks you can be much more creative being intramural than extramural Pennington is a pretty unique institution It’s becoming the largest institution for research in nutrition and obesity We concentrate mostly on nutrition and obesity We have about 500 people working at Pennington and everybody is doing research We have no formal teaching (yes, we have postdocs and things like that) We do research and we have maybe a functional budget of $80 million per year 50% or 45% of that is NIH extramural money coming to Pennington We do some sponsored project for pharma or biotech We have grants from associations like the American Diabetes Association or American Heart Association and so on We do basic science, clinical science, and population science Basically, which is to reach the community and implement some of the discovery into the community The science behind metabolic chambers for measuring energy expenditure, and the complexities of indirect and direct calorimetry [8:00] There’s 2 things: indirect calorimetry and direct calorimetry You generate your energy metabolism or ATP by oxidative process, and you oxidize carbohydrate, fat, and a little protein The build up these ATPs which are used for generation or maintenance of the cells or activity and so on Now, when you have this metabolism, you produce heat If you have no exercise, no external work, all the energy which is provided in generating this ATP is lost as heat And this is direct calorimetry Eric was fortunate when he did his Ph.D. back in Lausanne, Switzerland to have access to both indirect and direct calorimetry You can really do fantastic studies We did a study of measuring in vivo what we call the P/O ratio How many oxygen do you need to generate 1 ATP and all these kinds of things, by the combination of these 2 techniques When you’re doing direct calorimetry on something like food, if you want to know the energy content of food, you can burn the food and measure the heat It is also possible to do direct calorimetry in humans, and Eric was fortunate to be at a place which had 1 of the 2 direct calorimeters At the time, there was one in Bethesda (it doesn’t exist anymore, nor does the one in Switzerland) A direct calorimeter a little bit bigger than a cubic meter box, and you recover all the heat and you have dry heat by convection and you have a gradient layer capturing the heat production You collect the evaporative heat losses from perspiration, expiration and so on, and you merge all that and you have a complete heat balance of the person With direct calorimetry, we measure these 2 kinds of heat, and this is basically equal to your metabolic rate You generate energy by oxidation of substrate and the byproduct is heat And without exercise or external work, energy in is equal energy out Eric did a lot of these studies during his Ph.D. Now going to indirect calorimetry, this is an easier one than direct A metabolic chamber is like a hotel room in which you can live 1-2 days Peter stayed in one of these rooms at Pennington in Baton Rouge Here we measure oxygen consumption and CO2 production Oxygen is used to oxidize the substrate; it produces CO2 and water Knowing oxygen consumption and CO2 production, you can calculate the energy expenditure or the energy generated by this oxidative process; and you can also calculate the substrate that you oxidize If the ratio between the VCO2, the CO2 production and the oxygen consumption is 1, you oxidize carbohydrate If the ratio is 0.7, you oxidize fat And protein is something in between (0.82) depending on the protein Peter summarizes: By measuring just these 2 things: the concentration of oxygen consumed and the rate at which it’s being consumed, and the same with the production of CO2 You can infer the total energy consumption (total calories consumed, kcal) And by looking at the ratio of VCO2 and VO2, you can calculate what fraction of that is coming from oxidizing carbohydrate versus fat Peter explains, “Having spent probably a total of eight days of my life inside metabolic chambers across a period of a couple of years, it never ceases to amaze me, never just how accurately these rooms work.” Peter uses an indirect calorimeter all the time measuring VO2 max It’s basically the same technology, but it’s easier because you’re strapping the mask to your face, so you have perfect access to exactly the O2 consumption and the CO2 production It’s doing the exact same calculation It’s going to tell you exactly how much energy you’re utilizing and where the substrate comes from In that situation, you’re interested in knowing the maximum amount of VO2 or O2 consumption What would you estimate is the error on the hotel room sized indirect calorimeter where you don’t have the luxury of just slapping a mask to the person’s face for a few days? When Eric was at the NIH, they did a lot of reliability testing in the same person You can also calibrate the system with standard gas that you know the exact concentration You can also mimic someone by burning alcohol or propane and you can vary the rate of burning When Eric did a study with 4 different chambers, they validated the chambers, ones against the other one, and we accepted to have 3% deviation for CO2 or oxygen Based on stoichiometry, you know exactly how much alcohol or propane you burn, you know how much CO2 should be produced, and how much oxygen has been consumed And this is what we did The indirect calorimeter is very, very precise and you don’t have the inconvenience of the mask You couldn’t measure with a mask for 24 hours or 2 days When Peter as in that chamber for a couple of days (on separate occasions), we were trying to replicate his life as much as possible He had 3 meals prepared He had an exercise bike, weights, and equipment We were very interested in seeing how that would compare with what we knew Peter was experiencing in the outside world based on when we could put a mask on him. We also spent about 10 days using doubly labeled water (which we’ll talk about at some point) All of that is to say that scientists such as yourself have some pretty high fidelity tools to measure energy expenditure; but it comes with a caveat, which is it has to be done under this very controlled setting These people need to be in a metabolic ward inside a chamber Which is basically a NASA grade gas chamber with O2 and CO2 sensors Peter asks, “How many sensors… would be in a particular chamber?” We don’t need many because we need to homogenize the air in the room We have to measure humidity We have to measure temperature because you have to do this correction, what we call STPD, which is standard pressure, et cetera, to calculate the energy generated by this oxygen It’s quite phenomenal the accuracy of those ‒ the accuracy or the precision is about 2.5% Now if you repeat yourself 5x and myself, there’s a little bit more variability because we vary from one day to another one and so on But this is quite amazing that we can calculate so precisely your energy expenditure during a day or two days and so on The accuracy of calories consumed … {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

The way that you would put a gene into the brain is usually by using a virus This is a virus that exists in nature, but we have engineered it by removing everything that is pathogenic by the virus and then replacing those pathogenic genes with the gene that we’re trying to put into the brain In this case, it’s the gene from the green algae By injecting the virus into a brain area that you want to study, the virus will infect all the cells in that region and then make those cells begin to produce this algal protein Once the neuron starts to carry this algal protein, it becomes light sensitive, so you can turn blue light on it and then be able to stimulate it Feng finished his Ph.D. in 2009 and then went to Harvard for about a year, followed by MIT and the Broad As he was working on optogenetics (especially towards the end of graduate school), he began to realize that one of the biggest bottlenecks facing optogenetics is our ability to insert the algal gene into specific places in the genome The reason for that is because in order for us to study different types of brain cells, we need to have very precise targeting of different types of brain cells Brain cells are not just one type Neurons is not a single type There are probably hundreds of different types of brain cells The way that they’re defined is based on their molecular property Each brain cell, even though they all share the same genome, they have different sets of genes that are turned on That’s why brain cells that control pain sensation versus brain cells that are involved in Parkinson’s disease are different The way that you would target one or another type of brain cell is by figuring out what are the molecular signatures of that cell? If you know that gene A is turned on in that brain cell and not in another type of brain cell, then you can insert this algal gene into the region that’s controlling gene A That way, it will only get turned on in the first type of neuron The way to insert this gene into that precise place in the genome require gene editing, and it was really hard to do at the time “I thought maybe if I wanted to get optogenetics to become even more powerful and useful, we need to make gene editing more easy to use.”‒ Feng Zhang By the time he went to Harvard, he began to focus more on trying to figure out: how do you more easily be able to modify the genome? Peter asks, “Why was it easy to do what you did in Karl’s lab (relatively speaking), where you’re putting an entire gene into presumably an adenovirus and letting the adenovirus infect the neurons and stick a whole gene in? Why is that a different problem than the one you just described that you started to solve at Harvard?” The work he did as a graduate student with Karl was simply trying to insert a gene into brain cells ‒ we can get it into the rough area of the brain, but there are many different types of cells there We weren’t as precise in our ability to target those cells We also developed some tricks to be able to get it into a specific type of cell, but that was only limited to mice because we can genetically modify mice, and it’ll take a long time It will take a year or two years to be able to make those mice available to engineer them, but it wasn’t generally applicable Especially if you think about how to turn optogenetics into a therapeutic to use in humans We certainly couldn’t go in and use those transgenic technologies to make it work in the human brain ‒ this was a major problem The discovery of CRISPR in bacterial DNA, and the realization that these sequences could be harnessed for gene editing [10:45] The origins of gene editing in the ‘80s Gene editing stems from an observation that grew out of a discovery in sequences that existed in bacterial DNA, a certain type of repeating structure Feng was born in the ‘80s and back in the ‘80s, there was a group of Japanese researchers who were looking at DNA sequences of bacteria (at E. coli) What they found is that within some of the genomes (the DNA sequences of these bacteria) there are these regions that are very repetitive They just repeat over and over and over again Normally, genome sequences are not repetitive because they encode genes and different genes Here, they found that there are these repeat sequences that are all grouped together (they’re clustered) and they are not tandem repeat (so it’s not repeat one next to each other), but they’re interspaced by a short fixed length gap It’s basically A-B, A-C, A-D, A-E, A-G It just continues to repeat itself, but in this regularly space pattern When they first found it, they had no idea what the sequence was all about These repeating sequences were also palindromes DNA is double-stranded; there’s a top strand and there’s a bottom strand This is why they look like a double helix, so they twist and turn What is interesting is that when you read these repeat sequences from the top and you read in the reverse way on the bottom, they’re almost the same (they are palindromes) {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Failure of resveratrol to improve metabolic health is another nail in the coffin for the alleged “anti-aging” compound",
      "content": "In the health and geroscience sphere, resveratrol is like a bad penny. After this polyphenol compound burst onto the scene as an alleged “anti-aging” therapy about 20 years ago, the science behind the hypothesis was soon discredited, though not before it had captured public and commercial interest. To this day, countless resveratrol-based supplements and skincare products are marketed for combatting the ravages of time in various ways – from preventing wrinkles and reducing inflammation to extending lifespan. The continued commercial popularity has led to greater research interest and more hypothesized benefits beyond aging and lifespan, and these additional purported benefits in turn fuel further commercial popularity. Apart from aging, resveratrol has garnered substantial attention for potential positive impacts on metabolic health and has been proposed to reduce risk of obesity, improve glycemic control, and reduce circulating lipid levels.1,2 But is there any merit to these claims? A recent systematic review and meta-analysis sought to answer this question – and the results spell more bad news for resveratrol advocates.3 Why might resveratrol impact metabolic health? The idea that resveratrol might have positive effects on metabolic health stems from the same biochemical mechanism proposed for its alleged anti-aging effects. Early evidence indicated that resveratrol activated a class of enzymes known as sirtuins, which were thought to mediate the well-documented health- and longevity-promoting effects of calorie restriction – effects which include reductions in oxidative damage and in chronic, systemic inflammation. Resveratrol supplementation has therefore been touted as mimicking these benefits of calorie restriction through activation of sirtuins. And because oxidative damage and chronic inflammation contribute to many of the hallmarks of cellular aging (including metabolic dysfunction) and are thought to increase risk of several chronic diseases, slowing or halting these processes may plausibly extend lifespan and reduce risk of metabolic disease, among other effects. Thus, investigators involved in the present meta-analysis put this chain of logic to the test to examine whether the preponderance of data to date indicate that resveratrol supplementation might indeed improve various measures of metabolic health. What they did Authors Zahoor et al. analyzed data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials on resveratrol therapy in participants with overweight or obesity but without major comorbid conditions. After excluding studies that did not assess relevant outcome measures (which they specified as changes in triglyceride levels, total cholesterol, HbA1c, insulin, liver enzymes, or BMI), studies with fewer than nine participants per treatment arm, and studies in which participants were on other treatments which might have affected results, the investigators were left with five trials to include in their meta-analysis, comprising a total of 491 participants. Details of the included studies are shown in the table below. If an original study featured a crossover design, Zahoor et al. used only data from the first intervention period (pre-crossover) in order to avoid potential carryover effects from the initial treatment. For all included studies, the authors assessed data on outcome measures at the 4-week time point following treatment onset, though treatment duration for two of the included original trials had continued beyond this point. Results were generally reported as standardized mean differences (SMD), a metric used to estimate effect sizes in pooled data sets. (For further explanation of SMD, please refer to this newsletter.) Table: Randomized trials included in the present meta-analysis What they found Analyses of circulating triglycerides and insulin levels utilized data from all five studies (n=267), while four studies (n=177) were used for analysis of total cholesterol and three studies (n=87) supplied data for analysis of HbA1c and liver enzymes (AST and ALT). In their evaluation of plasma lipids, the authors reported that changes in both triglycerides and total cholesterol were statistically equivalent between resveratrol and placebo treatments, though resveratrol treatment was associated with a trend toward higher triglycerides than placebo (SMD=0.11; 95% CI: −0.14 to 0.35; P=0.39). No significant differences were observed between resveratrol treatment and placebo in effects on HbA1c, insulin, or the liver enzymes AST and ALT. Based on data from the two studies (112 participants) that assessed changes in BMI between pre- and post-intervention, Zahoor et al. noted that participants on resveratrol exhibited a slight, non-significant increase in BMI relative to participants on placebo (MD=0.21; 95% CI: −0.97 to 1.39; P=0.70). Altogether, these findings reveal that resveratrol offered no evident benefits relative to placebo across any measured parameters, which encompassed multiple facets of metabolic health such as glycemic control, plasma lipids, and liver function. Of note, analysis of heterogeneity indicated that results were highly consistent across included studies, adding to the reliability of these data. A closer look at the chain of logic Recall that the hypothesized connection between resveratrol and metabolic health relies on three main concepts: 1) resveratrol is bioavailable; 2) resveratrol activates sirtuins; and 3) activation of sirtuins mediates the health and longevity benefits of calorie restriction. If we accept these concepts as facts, then the logic behind the idea that resveratrol improves metabolic health is certainly sound. We might be tempted to dismiss Zahoor et al.’s negative results by pointing out the [admittedly] short intervention period and relatively small number of participants, and we’d continue on our merry way with unshaken faith in the power of resveratrol. But in reality, we can’t accept the concepts above as facts – indeed, we can’t even accept them as good guesses. While ~75% of oral resveratrol is absorbed, rapid metabolism limits its effective bioavailability to less than 1%.9 The so-called “sirtuin activating” effects of resveratrol have been shown to be nothing more than an artifact of in vitro experimental methods.10 Lifespan extension with sirtuin activation in yeast has been found to occur through pathways distinct from those of calorie restriction, and analogous longevity benefits in multicellular organisms have been irreproducible11 (a topic we will cover in greater depth in an upcoming premium article). In other words, the entire premise underlying both alleged anti-aging and pro-metabolic health effects of resveratrol has been rotten from the start, which renders Zahoor et al.’s findings anything but surprising. Far from validating potential “new” benefits in metabolism, this meta-analysis instead adds to the weight of evidence against resveratrol as an effective treatment or prevention strategy for any indication – whether aging, metabolic dysfunction, or otherwise. Another nail in the coffin And so here we are. The notion of resveratrol as a wonder drug has taken root in popular opinion, and eliminating it now requires more than simply debunking the original evidence which supposedly supported it. Even as research refutes some claims, new purported benefits emerge, creating a game of whack-a-mole for future studies and for those of us who genuinely wish to differentiate between promising interventions and marketing noise when it comes to health. And as the game continues, ever more time and money – which would be better spent on therapies with more legitimate support – drains into resveratrol research and consumer products. The present meta-analysis refutes metabolic improvements with resveratrol therapy and, in so doing, indirectly adds to the body of evidence that collectively undermines the proposed biochemical basis for nearly all of resveratrol’s alleged benefits. With any luck, these results might bang another nail into the resveratrol coffin. But this particular compound seems to have a talent for resurrection, and since I’m sure this won’t be the last we hear of it, the best we can do is stand ready with the hammer.

As soon as she discovered bone did that, she was hooked (it’s an incredible tissue) She did an animal study for her PhD and quickly realized that that was not something she wanted to do for the rest of her life because it involved killing animals constantly She went to Stanford and did a postdoc and that’s where she learned about clinical trials She realized that osteoporosis is the greatest burden when it comes to bone problems “Being an exercise head, that’s something that I wanted to figure out ‒ exactly what was the ideal exercise program to assist people living with osteoporosis.”‒ Belinda Beck Before the podcast, Peter figured out that they overlapped at Stanford for the entire 3 years of her postdoc (he was in medical school) Belinda’s clinical practice and research She is not a clinician She’s an exercise physiologist and she’s never had a personal clinical load Although exercise physiology is one of the allied health professions in Australia She came back to Australia to an academic position and has been teaching anatomy her whole professional career, but also continued bone research She’s a professor at Griffith University on the Gold Coast in Queensland Her career triangulated onto this question: there must be a way to load people who have osteoporosis in such a way that they can grow bone because everybody had been saying we couldn’t do that because their bones were so fragile She’ll come back to the actual trials She realized, “The nature of the exercise was not really safe for just anybody. And it needed to be applied in a certain way and very specifically. And it needed to be applied by somebody who really knew what they were doing because this is not a program that should be done unsupervised if you’re at high risk of fracture. And the only way to do that was to implement it in a clinic.” Now, it’s hard enough to convince doctors who’ve been telling osteoporotic patients for years that they should not lift anything heavy But to tell somebody in a clinic to start doing this exercise, she knew that was never going to happen This is why she set up The Bone Clinic It’s a clinical and translational research facility where this program is implemented Every patient that comes in is a research participant, and they agree to share their data They do the same testing as was done in the LIFTMOR trial Patients at The Bone Clinic The initial appointment is 2.5 hours where baseline data is collected Then every year thereafter, patients are tested again with the same thing to see if the exercise program works in the real world Patients are also advised on things like diet This is not a clinical trial as there is no control group She has gathered an enormous amount of data The physiology of bone, and how bones adapt to mechanical loading [8:15] Peter doesn’t recall getting much of an education on this, but given the ubiquity of osteopenia and osteoporosis, this is important for many physicians [Discussed further in AMA #37: Bone health] A basic way to describe bones is according to their shape {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Beyond the headlines: evaluating exercise as an equivalent to medication for the treatment of depression and anxiety",
      "content": "Popular media has touted a provocative claim that exercise is purportedly as effective as medication in treating symptoms of depression and anxiety. Such headlines are undoubtedly appealing, suggesting a simple, accessible remedy within everyone’s reach. Yet while the benefits of exercise for mental and physical health are well documented, we must be careful to assess such findings with a critical eye, even when they align so neatly with prevailing narratives and views, including some of my own. The claims arose from a 2023 study that quickly became a favorite reference in the world of health and wellness,1 but a closer examination reveals that the research contains key design flaws that muddy its findings. What’s worse, the data have further been subjected to interpretations that stretch beyond the reasonable implications of the actual results, veering into misrepresentation. Thus, this study serves as a classic example of how the necessary criticism of flawed research can be outpaced by a rush to produce attractive headlines rather than nuanced interpretations. Unpacking the study Investigators Verhoeven et al. sought to examine the therapeutic efficacy of traditional antidepressant medications compared to an alternative form of therapy – namely, running. The study targeted individuals diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders to understand how each treatment modality impacts not only mental but also physical health. The partially randomized study included 141 participants (mean age: 38.2 years, 58.2% female) assigned to either antidepressant medication (specifically escitalopram or sertraline, brand names Lexapro and Cipralex or Zoloft, respectively) or group-based running therapy (twice per week) for an intervention period of 16 weeks. To gauge the effectiveness of these treatments, assessments including the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (IDS-SR) were conducted at the beginning (T0) and the end (T16) of the treatment period. These evaluations covered a wide range of metrics concerning both mental health status (such as diagnostic status and symptom severity) and physical health indicators (like metabolic and immune markers, heart rate variability, waist circumference, grip strength, and overall fitness). By the end of the 16-week period, the intention-to-treat analysis revealed that remission rates for depression and anxiety were similar between the two groups – 44.8% for those on antidepressants and 43.3% for those participating in running therapy – with no statistically significant difference (P=0.881) in these rates. In addition, response rates (defined the proportion of participants achieving a reduction in IDS-SR and BAI scores of >50%) were also not statistically distinct, though on the BAI, they trended higher among participants in the antidepressant group (32.4% and 47.2% for running and antidepressants groups, respectively; P=0.20). However, when it came to physical health outcomes, the differences between the two treatments were unsurprisingly more pronounced, with participants in the running therapy group showing significant improvements in several physical health metrics compared to those in the medication group. Among these metrics were waist circumference (−1.6±0.8 cm in running group vs. +1.5±0.9 cm in the antidepressant group; P=0.011), both systolic (−2.5±1.6 vs. +3.8±1.8; P=0.011) and diastolic (−2.9±1.0 vs. +1.9±1.2; P=0.002) blood pressure, heart rate (−3.4±1.1 vs. −0.1±1.1; P=0.033), and heart rate variability (+1.2±3.8 vs. −14.4±3.9; P=0.006). The researchers thus concluded that while both interventions had comparable effects on mental health, running therapy offered additional benefits by improving several key physical health indicators, whereas the antidepressant group experienced some deteriorations in these areas. The elephant in the room And, boom. Cue the headlines. But as we delve into the study by Verhoeven et al., we must return to one small experimental detail with big implications for the reliability of these findings. Recall that this was a partially randomized trial, meaning that the investigators allowed participants to choose whether they wished to be randomly assigned to a treatment group or, alternatively, if they wished to choose their preferred treatment method. Of the 141 participants included in the study, the majority (83 individuals, or 59%) actively chose running therapy, with an additional 13 participants being assigned to this group. In contrast, 36 participants opted for medication, with nine more being assigned thereafter. Thus, only a small minority of the study participants were truly randomized, leading to an overwhelming 84% selecting their preferred treatment method. (Of note, the authors mention that they analyzed “inclusion type” – i.e., randomized vs. participant preference – and found no statistically significant interaction with treatment, suggesting that randomization versus preference had no impact on results. However, with only 22 participants in the randomized group, the lack of statistical significance could very easily be attributed to inadequate statistical power, and results stratified by inclusion type are not included in the published report.) The deviation from random allocation risks introducing significant potential confounds and biases, and, indeed, this turned out to be the case. Baseline assessments revealed that those opting for medication exhibited statistically significantly higher levels of depression based on the IDS-SR compared to their counterparts in the running group, with average scores of 46 for the medication group versus 40.5 for the running group (P=0.028). (Possible scores on this test range from 0 to 84, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms.) This suggests that the severity of symptoms may have driven the participants’ treatment choices – and indeed, a preference for antidepressants in the context of more severe depression would make sense given that loss of motivation is so often a devastating symptom of depression. Of course, this asymmetry in baseline depression severity prohibits any meaningful comparative analysis because any superior outcomes observed in one group might be due to the differences in participants’ baseline states rather than to differences in effectiveness of the treatments. If the running group started with milder symptoms, they might naturally show better outcomes simply due to a lesser severity of depression, rather than any particular efficacy of running therapy. Additionally, the preference for running therapy over medication could also reflect underlying participant characteristics for which the study does not account. For instance, these individuals might have a more positive initial attitude towards exercise and a belief in its benefits, which could contribute to a placebo effect or a bias in reporting symptoms, especially in light of the milder symptoms of depression in the group. Mental health metrics necessarily rely to a large extent on subjective reporting from participants, and such data are more susceptible to the influence of placebo effects or reporting biases. The elephant missing from the room The interpretation that has spread around popular media has been that this study shows running to be superior to antidepressants as a treatment for depression and anxiety, given its added physical health benefits and [alleged] equivalence to medication in mental health performance. Yet even if we ignore the huge problem of partial randomization and baseline differences in depressive symptoms, this interpretation is not quite justified, as the readouts the authors chose to compare have the potential to hide important differences between groups. In presenting their data, the authors chose to highlight the absence of significant differences in what they term “response rates greater than 50% on IDS-SR and BAI” between the treatment groups. This approach, however, raises a question: could it be possible that the medication-treated group actually experienced a higher response rate – say, 75% – compared to, say, 55% in the group undergoing running therapy? Without comparison of absolute percentages of response (as opposed to an arbitrary all-or-none threshold of 50% symptom reduction), the unfortunate reality is that we will never know. The authors also conspicuously omitted another more informative (and standard) indicator of efficacy: a between-group comparison of the respective reductions in symptom severity on the IDS-SR and BAI scales. Instead, they focused on within-group changes (i.e., differences between pre- and post-treatment within the same group), which can only tell us how an intervention changes depression symptoms relative to baseline rather than how it compares to an alternative treatment. But ironically, a face-value comparison of these within-group changes actually favors antidepressants, indicating that medication had a much more substantial impact on improving symptoms than running therapy. While running therapy improved BAI score by an average of –4.8±1.8 and IDS-SR by –8.5±2.4, antidepressants improved these scores by –9.0±2.0 and –13.9±2.1, respectively. Thus, depression and anxiety symptom scores decreased nearly twice as much in individuals who used antidepressants compared to those who engaged in running therapy, raising doubts about the earlier suggestions of equivalence between the two treatment modalities. Why bother? It’s fairly obvious that exercise would be superior to antidepressants in improving physical health, and plenty of evidence has already pointed to benefits of exercise on mood and mental health (including depression and anxiety). However, the claim that exercise could match the effectiveness of medication in treating mental health conditions is not supported by this study. It’s reasonable to conclude that this paper does not significantly enhance our understanding of running therapy’s efficacy in treating depression and anxiety whatsoever, let alone relative to antidepressant medications. So why bother giving this study any attention? The first reason is simply to highlight some of the flaws in interpretations of this study that have circulated around popular press and social media. While this work may generate appealing headlines or support popular narratives on “natural” solutions over medical treatments, these conclusions oversimplify complex treatment dynamics, leading to the widespread propagation of reductive and sometimes misleading advice. Such interpretations and narratives can be particularly harmful when they influence public perceptions of mental health. They can undermine the real challenges faced by individuals with severe depression, for whom initiating an exercise regimen can be a daunting, if not impossible, task – and may not be sufficient to keep depressive symptoms at bay. Thus, the implication that running alone can suffice as treatment not only trivializes the nuanced nature of mental illness but also poses potential risks to those who might forgo necessary medical treatment in light of these research interpretations. If anything, this study should caution against any one-size-fits-all approach to mental health treatment and should certainly not be interpreted as endorsing such a simplistic solution. But perhaps an even larger motivation for discussing this work is to emphasize the importance of critical analysis even (or perhaps, especially) when it comes to scientific research that might at first glance support one’s own biases and preferences. It’s no secret that I believe exercise to be a vital and powerful tool for promoting mental, cognitive, and physical health and well-being, and research to date certainly strongly supports this perspective. It would be easy to take a quick look at Verhoeven et al.’s results, latch onto them as more evidence that exercise is a “miracle drug” without giving them any further thought, and share them in a newsletter titled “See? I told you so!” But this would be a disservice to my readers and would only serve to add to the widespread oversimplification and misinterpretation that I’ve just described above. Indeed, it is when I encounter research that aligns with my own biases that I must be most critical in order to ensure that I am assessing the work for what it is – not for what I hope it to be. And I strongly encourage anyone reviewing scientific findings to do the same. A more constructive takeaway on exercise and mental health Regular physical activity has been demonstrated to support health in numerous ways, including enhancing mood, improving sleep, and reducing stress, anxiety, and feelings of depression. For many individuals, initiating an exercise regimen could serve as a first step in supporting their well-being – with respect to mental and physical health. And it’s certainly possible that exercise alone may promote improvements in health to an extent that reduces the need for a variety of pharmacological therapies, from medications for depression to medications for blood pressure to medications for diabetes. But just as it would be reductive and irresponsible to assume that exercise alone will always be sufficient to treat high blood pressure or diabetes, it would likewise be reductive and irresponsible to assume that exercise alone will always be sufficient to treat depression or anxiety. This is not to diminish the value of exercise as a beneficial intervention but highlights the need for a balanced and well-rounded approach to mental health treatment that may include, but not rely solely on, physical activity. Though Verhoeven et al.’s data fit nicely into popular perceptions of “lifestyle”-based approaches to health over medical treatments, they in fact provide no clear insights on the relative effectiveness of exercise and antidepressant medications for mental health. While exercise is beneficial and should – regardless of mental health status – be incorporated into any health plan, it should nevertheless be one part of a comprehensive approach to health that may also include other treatments and interventions, especially for those with moderate to severe depression and anxiety. Each individual’s needs and responses to different treatments will vary, making it essential to consider a range of options and possibly combine several strategies for optimal outcomes.

Illustration of a synapse. Image credit: Wikipedia There are many different neurotransmitters in the brain, and they have many different functions Dopamine has become the common currency for measuring pleasure, reward, and motivation It’s not the only neurotransmitter involved in that process, but it is the final common pathway for all reinforcing substances and behaviors Whether the substance is primarily modulating our serotonergic system or norepinephrine or the nicotinic system or the endogenous opioid system or the endogenous cannabinoid system, the final common pathway for all of those chemical cascades is to release dopamine in a dedicated part of the brain called the reward circuitry Reward circuitry consists of the prefrontal cortex (that large gray matter area right behind our foreheads) and these deeper limbic or emotion brain structures like the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area Figure 2. Neuroanatomy of reward circuitry and dopamine release. Image credit: Foundations of Neuroscience 2021 We’re always releasing dopamine at a baseline tonic level But when we do something that’s pleasurable or reinforcing , then temporarily we will increase dopamine firing above baseline Something that our brains consider salient or important for survival, in some cases it might even be an aversive stimulus That generally feels good to us, which is how we tell our brains, “Oh, this is important. I should approach, explore, and consider doing this again.” Broadly speaking, that’s dopamine’s function It’s not its only function Dopamine is also really important for movement Parkinson’s disease (which is a movement disorder) is characterized by a decrease or a depletion of dopamine in a different part of the brain called the substantia nigra One of the ways that we treat Parkinson’s is to actually give people L-DOPA, which is a dopamine precursor Why do we give them L-DOPA and not dopamine? Because dopamine itself actually can’t cross the blood-brain barrier So we give them a precursor that crosses the blood-brain barrier and then binds to dopamine receptors in the substantial nigra allowing for more fluid movements in people with Parkinson’s Unfortunately, L-DOPA transformed to dopamine also binds dopamine receptors in the reward pathway, which is why about a quarter of folks with Parkinson’s who get treated with L-DOPA end up with addictive disorders that are usually reversible when you stop the L-DOPA and tend to be dose dependent So the more L-DOPA, the more likely the sex addiction, shopping addiction or whatever the compulsive behavior Are humans more susceptible to addiction because we have a larger prefrontal cortex, or is it not as simple as the anatomic size of this part of the brain? The prefrontal cortex comes up a lot when we talk about dementia and higher order cognitive function judgment centers It is also something that is more developed in our species than others The prefrontal cortex has many roles, and when we think about its role in addiction or other appetitive disorders, it actually has a stop function If you analogize to a car, the prefrontal cortex acts like the brakes on the car It allows for delayed gratification This is where we have the control centers It allows for appreciating future consequences It lights up when we’re engaged in autobiographical narrative And of course, narrative is part of the ways that we actually create metacognitive awareness to inform future decisions Having a very robust prefrontal cortex is potentially protective against addiction People who have cognitive or attentional disorders, who are thought to have a disorder of the prefrontal cortex (for example, attention deficit disorder) are at higher risk to develop addictive disorders The nucleus accumbens is the accelerator The nucleus accumbens is deep in the brain, is rich in dopamine releasing neurons, and that acts like the accelerator on the car “Addiction is a problem either with too little on the brakes, too much on the accelerator, or some combination thereof.”‒ Anna Lembke Anna explains, “In terms of whether or not humans are more likely to get addicted than animals, I would say no.” What’s remarkable about this reward circuitry is how incredibly conserved it is over millions of years of evolution and across species Neuroscientists used to talk about the lizard brain or the triune brain They’re not typically using that phraseology so much anymore, but what they were getting at was that if you look at the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, it’s amazingly unchanged across species over millions of years of evolution It’s really our reflexive approach in pleasure and avoiding pain is what has kept us alive for so many, many generations on the planet It’s a very basic primordial structure that all living organisms, even primitive organisms have Even the most primitive nematode or worm will release dopamine in response to food in its environment, which that dopamine allows it to locomote toward food It’s probably not that the same neurotransmitter involved in movement is also involved in pleasure, reward, and motivation, because prior to about 500 years ago, if you wanted to get a reward, you had to work for it That’s no longer true, which is one of the reasons our brains are so confused today You could almost make the argument that because we have these large frontal lobes that can sort of reason and appreciate future consequences, human beings might be even more capable of getting out of the cycle of addiction than other organisms It is miraculous that even people deep in the most severe addiction can find somewhere within themselves the capacity to stop using “It seems to me almost a miracle in my clinical work when I get people who have been in severe addictions for decades who somehow find it within themselves, either through some logical reasoning or some spiritual surrender or some combination to actually get into recovery.”‒ Anna Lembke The clinical definition of addiction, and the behavioral criteria for diagnosing it [13:00] How does one truly define an addiction in a clinical setting? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Research Worth Sharing, October 2024 Edition",
      "content": "Welcome to another edition of “Research Worth Sharing” – a roundup of recent research that we’ve found interesting and which we hope might provide worthwhile insights to others as well. Adaptive diet and physical activity interventions based on biofeedback enhance weight loss in obese individuals Why we are interested: For individuals with obesity, loss of fat mass is a critical step toward the goal of improving healthspan and lifespan, but after the first few pounds are shed, the body compensates in a number of ways to prevent further losses – for instance, by reducing metabolic rate and increasing hunger. As a result, patients tend to plateau in weight loss before achieving their final goal, as the diet and physical activity regimens that had initially shown promise prove to be ineffective after this early phase. One potential strategy for preventing such a premature plateau is to modulate diet and activity plans based on changes in whole-body energy expenditure over time. This study sought to examine whether using biofeedback on energy expenditure to inform and adapt weight loss strategies would enhance losses in body weight and fat mass relative to standard diet and activity counseling alone. What this study showed: In this randomized trial, 52 participants with obesity were counseled by dietitians and advised to maintain a standard level of calorie restriction (30% or 500 kcal/day below daily energy requirements, whichever was greater) and a minimum of 150 min of physical activity per week for the course of the 24-week study. For half of these participants (INT group), dietitians modulated recommendations throughout the study based on energy expenditure information derived from portable indirect calorimetry devices, while dietitians did not modify recommendations for control participants. By the end of the trial, participants in the INT group had lost more total weight than controls (-2.3 kg; 95% CI: -3.1 to -1.5; P<0.001) and showed greater reductions in body fat percentage (-1.5%; 95% CI: -2.31 to -0.72; P<0.001). Further, a substantially higher proportion of participants in the INT group achieved a minimum of 5% weight loss from baseline than participants in the control group (42% of INT group vs. 8% of control group; P=0.007). These results indicate that integrating ongoing feedback on metabolic changes to personalize and adapt diet and physical activity plans can improve the probability of avoiding weight plateaus prior to achievement of weight loss goals. doi: 10.1111/cob.12703 Exercise may be the best defense against falls in older adults Why we are interested: Falls are a major contributor to both disability and mortality among older adults. Many strategies may help to reduce one’s risk of falls and fall-related injuries – for instance, installing railings in homes or using nutritional supplements to enhance bone density. Yet although these approaches may have positive effects, the most critical prevention strategy relies on exercise for building strength and stability. What this study showed: The authors of this report analyzed data from randomized clinical trials investigating either exercise-based (37 trials, n=16,117) or multifactorial (28 trials, n=27,784) interventions for the prevention of falls and fall-related injuries. Multifactorial interventions typically involved various components such as nutrition, medication management, environment modification, and some aspects of exercise, whereas exercise-specific interventions involved various exercise modalities, frequencies, and intensities. Both intervention types were associated with significant and roughly equivalent reductions in overall fall risk (~15% risk reduction), while exercise-focused interventions were additionally associated with significant reductions in risk of injurious falls (incidence rate ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74-0.95) and in individual risk of ≥1 falls (i.e., the number of participants who experienced falls; risk ratio: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87-0.98). Given the homogeneity of multifactorial interventions and the fact that neither this analysis nor the trials included within it assessed how these intervention types performed relative to each other (as opposed to relative to control groups with no intervention), these results should not be interpreted as evidence that exercise alone is superior to a combinatorial approach to fall prevention. However, they do support the notion that exercise is likely the single most effective strategy and thus is an essential element of any approach to fall prevention. doi: 10.1001/jama.2024.4166 Supportive social interactions may reduce susceptibility to stress eating Why we are interested: Calorie intake in excess of energy needs leads to gains in fat mass, which in turn increases risks for all four “horsemen” of chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, cancer, and metabolic disease). Many individuals are particularly susceptible to excess calorie intake during periods of high stress – a phenomenon known as “stress eating.” The resulting sensations of guilt or gains in body weight can exacerbate feelings of stress, leading to a vicious downward cycle in mental and physical health. Insights into possible ways of reducing susceptibility to stress eating thus have the potential to help many to escape the cycle and improve overall health trajectories. What this study showed: This study assessed how emotional support from social relationships impacted the link between stress, food intake, and weight gain. Stress-eating tendencies were evaluated at baseline in a cohort of 1,264 individuals, and emotional support was assessed over an 8-day window. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were then monitored for a follow-up period of approximately 10 years. Results showed that baseline susceptibility to stress eating positively correlated with increases in BMI and WHR only among participants who had reported lower than average emotional support during the initial 8-day assessment period. In other words, baseline susceptibility to stress eating was not associated with weight gain among those who were more likely to receive emotional support from friends and family. In a separate cohort (n=536), the authors evaluated the relationship between stress eating and emotional support more directly over the course of 24 days, reporting that individuals who were typically susceptible to stress eating were less likely to engage in this behavior on days when they reported higher (vs. lower) perception that others cared about them. Importantly, this study was purely observational and cannot establish causality. Indeed, investigating the health effects of social support in humans in a manner that isn’t plagued by countless potential confounds is virtually impossible. However, the results nevertheless suggest that those who struggle with stress eating may benefit from fostering close personal relationships or otherwise taking action to increase social support. doi: 10.1037/hea0001389 An atlas of changes associated with skeletal muscle aging Why we are interested: Aging is associated with marked declines in skeletal muscle mass and strength, resulting in gradual loss of physical function in our later years. Understanding the cellular and molecular biology behind this decline may inform the development of strategies to slow or prevent it, and the process of reaching such an understanding can be aided by the organization and public dissemination of data upon which future research might build. What this study showed: This study utilized single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of over 90,000 muscle cells and nuclei from 17 human donors in order to characterize muscle aging on the cellular and subcellular level. Results revealed clues as to the mechanisms underlying several phenomena related to age-related declines in muscle function, including degeneration of neuromuscular junctions, reduction in activation of muscle stem cells, and increases in muscle inflammation. In an effort to promote further advances in this area, the investigators also developed an online atlas in which these data are available publicly. doi: 10.1038/s43587-024-00613-3 For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama",

This episode is an exception, being released ahead of schedule due to the rapidly evolving topic of GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic, tirzepatide). Peter first discussed GLP-1 agonists in November 2021 in a previous episode. Did a follow-up episode in March 2023. The topic has gained massive interest and has seen significant developments over time. Growing Popularity: When first discussed, GLP-1 agonists seemed overly technical and not widely known. Now, GLP-1 agonists are everywhere in the media, reflecting their growing prominence and relevance. Key Focus Areas of the Episode: How the drugs work: A brief recap of their mechanisms, although more detailed discussions are available in previous AMAs. Differences between the drugs: Exploring how different GLP-1 agonists compare. Compounded injections: Discussing alternative formulations like compounded versions of these drugs. Weight regain: Examining what is known about weight regain after stopping the medication. Safety profiles: Updating listeners on the safety concerns and new findings. Changed perspectives: Host mentions that the ongoing conversations and growing data have caused him to revise his views on certain aspects. Peter’s Perspective on GLP-1 Agonists Peter reflects on how much the understanding of GLP-1 agonists has evolved. He acknowledges that some of his earlier views have changed based on new evidence. Long History of the Drug Class: Liraglutide: First prescribed by Peter in 2014, it was not very effective for most patients. Semaglutide: In fall 2020, Peter began prescribing semaglutide, which was a much different and more effective experience than liraglutide, even before semaglutide was approved for obesity. The focus in this episode is more on what is newly known and relevant rather than repeating older, well-established information. Knowledge Gaps and Evolving Understanding Changes in Understanding: The field of GLP-1 agonists is continuously advancing, and Peter stresses that while they know much more now than before, there are still things left to learn. Peter highlights the importance of acknowledging the unknowns and remaining open to new information. Caution with Early Drug Generations: Earlier drugs like liraglutide did not have the same efficacy, highlighting how far the field has come with newer drugs like semaglutide. GLP-1 Agonists’ Growing Importance: Once a niche and technical topic, GLP-1 agonists are now widely recognized and are expected to have a transformative impact on obesity and diabetes treatment. As research and data continue to emerge, the understanding of these drugs and their use cases will likely evolve, with more to cover in future episodes. Focus of Upcoming Discussion The episode will dive into the new data on weight loss, differences between drugs, and how to approach these medications in light of new information. The mechanism of GLP-1 agonists, their origin as diabetes treatments, and how they evolved into weight-loss drugs [6:45] Overview of GLP-1 Agonists’ Origins and Role in Diabetes Management Initial Development: GLP-1 agonists were initially developed to manage Type 2 diabetes. These drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), which helps stimulate insulin release from the pancreas. This stimulation is vital for patients with Type 2 diabetes, as their pancreas is not producing enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes is largely managed through increasing insulin release and improving insulin sensitivity, which helps glucose enter the liver and muscles more effectively. Why GLP-1 Agonists Became a Hot Topic: GLP-1 agonists were primarily seen as tools to lower blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c in diabetic patients. Semaglutide vs. Liraglutide: Semaglutide’s key breakthrough was its ability to dramatically reduce patients’ weight, something that liraglutide did not accomplish as effectively. This unexpected benefit led to a new question: Can these drugs be used as weight-loss medications for non-diabetic patients? Clinical trials conducted around three years ago answered this question with a resounding yes, marking a significant development in the perception of these drugs. Quick Summary of How GLP-1 Agonists Work Key Mechanisms: Pancreas: Stimulates insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion, leading to lower blood sugar levels. Jejunum and Ileum (Small Intestine): Slows gastric emptying and reduces GI motility, which prolongs the feeling of fullness and slows glucose absorption. Liver: Reduces hepatic glucose production, similar to how Metformin works. Brain: Activates satiety signals and inhibits appetite-driving circuits, which plays a significant role in weight loss. Early research underestimated how much this central regulation of appetite contributed to weight loss. GLP-1 Agonists’ Effects on Fat and Muscle Tissue Fat Tissue: GLP-1 agonists increase glucose uptake from the blood and boost lipolysis (the breakdown of fat), which helps burn fat while improving insulin sensitivity. Though it may seem counterintuitive, the drugs do not make fat cells “fatter” but rather enhance the overall metabolic processing of fat. Muscle Tissue: Increases the muscles’ ability to oxidize glucose, further aiding in blood sugar control and energy use. Figure 1. Source: Saraiva and, Sposito Cardiovasc Diabetol. Oct 2014. Peter briefly mentions that GLP-1 agonists likely have significant effects on the heart and kidneys, which will be discussed in more detail later in the podcast. These areas are considered topics of immense interest due to their potential broader health benefits. {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Do humans age in distinct rapid bursts instead of gradually over time?",
      "content": "Recently, several news outlets latched onto some interesting data reported this summer in Nature Aging: aging isn’t linear, but instead occurs in two sharp peaks over the course of human adulthood, corresponding approximately to ages 44 and 60.1 Great, another reason to dread the big “6-0.” We know that aging is caused by changes at the molecular level that lead to downstream effects like disease and degeneration. Fully characterizing these changes is therefore an important step in understanding the aging process and potentially developing interventions to slow its progression. Thanks to the advent of methodologies to collect and analyze “big data” in biology, scientists are more empowered than ever to investigate these molecular underpinnings of aging, and thus, researchers Shen et al. undertook an ambitious study of millions of metrics in order to understand how they change over a human lifetime. Their findings – as reported in mainstream media – point to two distinct bursts of aging-related changes, but how should we interpret these data? What they did Researchers collected multiple samples from 108 U.S. subjects between the ages of 25-75 (51.9% female) for a median period of 1.7 years. Samples of blood, stool, and swabs of skin, oral mucosa, and nasal mucosa were collected every 3-6 months from all participants for as long as they were healthy, and Shen et al. used these samples to collect various “-omics” data (e.g., transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics) as well as microbiome data for respective tissues and typical laboratory tests such as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), a lipid panel, a complete blood count, and others. Defining baseline as data from the youngest participants (those between the ages of 25-40 years), the authors compared dysregulated molecules in each age group to the baseline and across other age groups. What they found The researchers found that a large majority (81.0%) of molecules showed changes in at least one age category compared to the baseline, but only a small portion of all the molecules and microbes (6.6%) showed a linear aging pattern. Indeed, in subsequent analyses, they found that thousands of the molecules they tested exhibited two major wave crests of change. Using sliding 20-year windows to compare molecule levels across successive 10-year age ranges (for example, molecule levels from participants aged 40-50 were compared to those of participants aged 50-60, and molecule levels from participants aged 41-51 were compared to those of participants aged 51-61, etc.), they observed peak changes at approximately 44 and 60 years of age (see Figure below). This means, for instance, that individuals at age 44 are more drastically different on the molecular level from individuals at age 43 than those at age 43 are from those at age 42, and so on, whereas individuals at approximately age 53 (a local minimum) show only relatively modest molecular differences from those at age 52 or 54. In other words, these data indicate that humans age non-linearly – experiencing the most rapid aging bursts around ages 44 and 60, while rates of aging appear to slow between ages 44-53 and after age 60. Figure: Molecules and microbes across multi-omics data that were found to be differentially expressed during aging. From Shen et al. 2024¹ Of note, these crests were apparent across multiple different types of -omics data, though some displayed only one of the two peaks (e.g., lipidomics data, which only demonstrated a peak around age 45, followed by fairly consistent decline in the number of significant differences between subsequent age groups). However, the authors also note that most of the dysregulated molecules were the same between the two peaks. Molecules present in both peaks included several associated with cardiovascular disease as well as many involved in skin and muscle instability, indicating that these crests might correspond to periods of increased cardiovascular risk or more rapid skin/muscle deterioration. By applying principal component analysis to their multi-omics data (a method that reduces large, high-dimensionality datasets into a few essential factors – or “principal components” – that collectively account for most of the variability in the original dataset2), the authors found that the first “principal component” for many of the -omics datasets demonstrated significant correlations with participants’ ages. This means the variation in the levels of molecules and microbes observed across these datasets served as an effective predictor of participants’ ages – particularly with respect to metabolomics, cytokines, and oral microbiome data. Through additional analyses, the investigators identified eleven different clusters of molecules that changed during aging, within which they pointed out plausible connections to age-related processes and diseases such as metabolic dysregulation and reductions in DNA repair function. Based on their finding of a nonlinear pattern of molecular dysregulation, Shen et al. surmised that there is a systemic, coordinated change across molecules and in many different locations in the body. They optimistically conclude that the identification of peaks in age-related changes around age 44 and 60 might inform the development of more effective strategies for prevention and early diagnosis of age-related diseases. Yet if we look past the complicated algorithms, colorful figures, and the enthusiastic conclusions, we quickly find that all is not as it seems. A cross-sectional study disguised as longitudinal Though the authors describe their data as “longitudinal,” this term is a stretch. While it’s true that participants provided multiple samples over time, the median follow-up was only 1.7 years (corresponding to 4-8 time points). That is not nearly enough time to collect any meaningful results about biological markers that might change with aging. Even the maximum follow-up period was just 6.8 years – hardly representative of the entirety of adulthood. Thus, rather than following the same individuals as they progressed through life and determining whether common patterns existed among multiple people, Shen et al. assessed patterns of aging by comparing largely cross-sectional data from people of different ages. But cross-sectional comparisons are less reliable for evaluating changes over time than longitudinal data. It’s unclear if comparing someone who is 70 years old to someone who is 40 years old reveals anything useful about the 70-year-old at 40 or the 40-year-old at 70. Likewise, one cannot assume that a change seen in a handful of 60-year-olds at a specific point in time will necessarily occur in ten years to people who are 50 years old at that same point, as individuals who differ in age at one particular cross-sectional point also are likely to differ in other variables relevant to aging – as trends in diet, education, health awareness, environmental exposures, and countless other factors change with successive decades and generations. Indeed, Shen et al.’s own findings reveal how little utility these cross-sectional patterns have on the level of any given individual. Examining data from the longest-participating subject (who began the study at age 59.5 and continued until age 66.3 – a range that partially overlaps with one of the alleged peak aging phases), the authors report, “it was not possible to identify obvious patterns in this short time window.” The sample was very small and non-representative Across all the samples taken and tests conducted, the investigators collected over 240 billion data points on over 130 million biological features. This may sound like a large amount, but all of these points were from only 108 individuals – very small for a study intended to draw conclusions about aging patterns in all of humanity. (If you collect data from only one person, even an infinite amount of data can tell you only about that one person.) To make matters worse, the tiny sample is also not representative of a broad population. Every study participant was from the same area in California. Two-thirds were Caucasian, while most of the remainder were Asian. Black and Hispanic backgrounds were grossly underrepresented relative to their true proportions in the American population. Even the age range (a critical parameter for a study evaluating aging patterns) was non-representative, as the oldest participant was only 75 – a limit which would have entirely missed any aging changes that might take place beyond this age. What’s behind these aging patterns? Even if this had been a longitudinal study and had included a far greater number of participants representing far more diverse backgrounds, we still couldn’t extrapolate these data to draw any overarching insights on the aging process because we have no clear evidence that the patterns observed in this study reflect inherent biological phenomena as opposed to changes induced by evolving environments and life circumstances. Indeed, the discovery of two distinct periods of accelerated aging should raise questions about whether anything else might be going on at those stages of life. External circumstances often change in predictable ways across a human lifetime. For instance, adults in their 40s are often reaching higher (and more stressful) levels of responsibility in their careers, caring for teenagers and elderly parents at the same time, and facing the financial pressure of their own mortgages and their children’s approaching college tuition bills. Around age 60, many experience decreases in their physical abilities, approach retirement and loss of their career as part of their identity, face the death of parents, spouses, or friends, and generally begin to face their own mortality. The molecular changes observed in this study could be linked to these kinds of external stressors (and/or any behavioral changes that might accompany them – such as reduced sleep or physical activity) rather than to any programmed chronological aging process, as this study assumes. And because the authors adjusted for a very small number of covariates across study participants, we have all the more reason to suspect that results reflect variables other than chronological age. The probability of contributions from external factors also increases when we take into account the relative homogeneity of the study cohort and small sample size. White Californians from a similar socioeconomic class are likely to share cultural as well as biological similarities, which reinforces the point that some – or even all – of the noted changes could be due to sociocultural stages rather than biological ones. (To illustrate this point, let’s consider the so-called “freshman 15.” If you examine metabolic markers in a set of American prep school students from age 15 until age 22, you’d probably see changes peaking around age 18-19 due to the start of college and the new food environments related to that life change. If you instead look at this span of time in a population for which military service is mandated at age 18, I’d bet the patterns would look very different…) What can we learn from this study? This paper makes a nice story with its large volume of data, complicated analyses, and attractive charts and figures, but it’s easy to get lost in the trees and never see the forest. If we truly wanted to generate useful insights into patterns of aging based on multi-omics data, we would need a much larger, longer study including subjects of more diverse ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Such a study is unlikely to be conducted due to the high cost involved for a comprehensive analysis over several decades of time points. Unfortunately, cutting corners in the case of the present study leaves us with little in the way of reliable knowledge gained. Shen et al. do indeed provide compelling evidence that humans (or at least, White Californians) undergo relatively dramatic biological changes at a molecular level around their mid-40s and their late 50s to early 60s. But their data reveal nothing about the relationship between these changes and any programmed biology of aging. The combination of the cross-sectional nature of the study and the small, non-representative cohort make it highly likely that the observed patterns reflect environmental, behavioral, or sociocultural variables that may correlate with particular ages but are not inherently linked to age itself. Ultimately, this means that these patterns have little relevance on an individual scale – as any given individual may differ in the points at which these other variables come into play (e.g., some may experience the death of a parent at a relatively young age, while others might experience stresses related to childcare at relatively advanced ages). So while these results make for great headlines, they don’t need to be taken as a reason to fear the big “6-0” (or the “4-4”…) any more than any other birthday.

(May 20, 2024) *** Julia discussed liver health, liver disease (NAFLD, MASLD), everything as it relates to the liver This was at times a technical episode This is a classic episode of The Drive, meaning you don’t expect to turn on a podcast and walk into a graduate level seminar on the liver, but if you take a step back and think about it, we kind of need to The liver is arguably one of the most important organs in the body It is an organ for which we have no extracorporeal support Meaning if your kidneys fail (God forbid, that’s very bad), at least you have the option of dialysis If your lungs fail, at least you have a ventilator Even if your heart temporarily fails, we have ways to support that outside the body Remarkably we don’t have this for the liver If a person goes into liver failure, their only solution is a liver transplant And that speaks to the diversity and complexity of function in this organ We talk about the function of the liver in 3 categories: metabolism, protein synthesis, and detoxification There simply is no parallel for those things Then talked about the role of alcohol Everybody’s aware that alcohol is metabolized by the liver and therefore that excess alcohol is toxic We talk a little bit about the how and the why The metabolite of ethanol known as acetaldehyde basically causes all of the downstream problems by overwhelming the redox potential of cells in the liver And that creates the attraction of free radicals and inflammatory cells We did a great job talking about dose makes the poison here So if a standard drink contains about 14-15 grams of ethanol, that will usually be found in about 12 ounces of a regular beer Interestingly, Peter’s favorite beer contains 10% alcohol, and you would get that 14 g in far less volume 14-15 g ethanol is also contained in 5 oz. of wine contains 1.5 oz. liquor Figure 1. Examples of a standard drink that contain 14 grams of alcohol. Image credit: Wikipedia It’s not intuitive for people to think about how many grams of ethanol they’re consuming The show notes give more details on the toxicity of ethanol based on how many grams per day or grams per week you’re consuming MASLD or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease “We talk about NAFLD, and that’s something that’s been talked about for the last 20 years. It’s the fastest growing form of liver disease in the developed world. And it’s probably poised in its long-term sequelae to be the leading indication for liver transplant within the next decade.”‒ Peter Attia The name has changed from NAFLD to MASLD to make the name more encompassing NAFLD has the intuitive point of saying it’s a fatty liver disease that does not result from the consumption of alcohol because AFLD (or alcoholic fatty liver disease) would be the sister disease This idea of MASLD (or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) speaks to the complete overlap of insulin resistance metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes The overlap is so strong that Peter doesn’t know that it matters that much According to Julia, 99.6% of people who meet criteria for NAFLD will also have the diagnosis of MASLD The diagnosis is based on metabolic dysfunction The key requirements for MASLD diagnosis You have to have insulin resistance It also requires that at least 5% of the hepatocytes (liver cells, it’s the functional unit of the liver) contain fat But it does not require fibrosis In this podcast Peter remembered things he once knew but had forgotten The difference between kids and adults is the pattern of fibrosis they have In kids, it’s more circulated around the portal vein The portal vein is the vein that brings the majority of the nutrients to the liver The portal vein is formed by the confluence of 2 enormous veins in the abdomen (the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein) In that sense, the liver has 2 blood flows that are coming into it: 1 through the portal vein and 1 through the hepatic artery The implication is what do you see from a diagnosis perspective, and in kids, you’re going to see an earlier increase in ALT, AST and GGT You often hear ALT, AST, and GGT referred to as liver function tests We talk about how we accept that as terminology, but the reality of it is they really tell us nothing about liver function They are enzymes that are associated with liver or hepatocyte health When those enzymes go up, we generally understand that some sort of injury has taken place (we’ll talk about that more in a moment) Pattern of fibrosis and steatosis in adults In adults, the fibrosis and steatosis tends to occur closer to the central vein As a result of that, you see a delay in the enzyme elevation So what does that mean clinically? It means that if you’re an adult and you’re developing steatosis and fibrosis, it could actually be taking place for quite a while before you see it And that’s why another huge takeaway (which we’ll get to in a moment) is that this reliance on elevations of the transaminases (which are the technical names for ALT and AST), and using that as your threshold for concern might be waiting a little bit too long The top three causes of liver injury in the form of steatosis and fibrosis are: #1 MASLD, followed by alcoholic liver disease, and finally, infections (hepatitis is the most common) The fact that MASLD is now #1 is something that wasn’t even close to true 20, 30, 40 years ago There is an older episode with Chris Sonnenday on organ transplantation that talks about the liver In Outlive, Peter recounts a story when he was an intern more than 20 years ago doing pre-op on a patient … {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "High-intensity interval training and cognitive function in older adults: promising but limited findings",
      "content": "As we age, forgetfulness and dementia become significant health concerns, with memory and learning being especially vulnerable. The hippocampus (the brain region largely responsible for the consolidation of these memories) has been shown to decrease in volume with age.1 Perhaps preventing or reversing hippocampal atrophy (shrinkage) and the associated decline in learning and memory could prevent the onset of dementia. Back in “Ask Me Anything” episode #46 of The Drive, I discussed how physical activity can reduce risk of cognitive decline by various mechanisms, but research on the most effective forms of exercise for this purpose has been limited. Yet a randomized study by Blackmore & Schaumberg et al. recently addressed certain aspects of this very question, comparing the effects of various training intensities on learning and memory.2 About the study The authors performed a randomized controlled study involving a six-month exercise regimen with cognitively normal participants (65-85 years old) split into one of three groups: light-intensity training (LIT, n=53), medium-intensity training (MIT, n=44), or high-intensity interval training (HIIT, n=54). In this case, LIT served essentially as a non-exercise control group, as training was limited to stretching, balance work, and relaxation. Participants across all groups exercised three times per week under supervision, with each session totalling 40-45 minutes including warmup and cooldown. Specific exercise protocols are detailed below. Table: Exercise protocols The authors were primarily interested in changes in cognitive function following these exercise regimens. This was measured using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) – a series of tasks performed on a computer that includes an array of memory tests. HIIT performs better than MIT or LIT in improving PAL scores While the investigators conducted four tests within the CANTAB battery, results from only one – the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test – were found to differ significantly between groups. For this test, which assesses how well people learn and recall associations (i.e., visual learning and associative memory – which are among the earliest cognitive domains affected by Alzheimer’s disease), participants are shown patterns hidden behind rectangles and must click the correct one when a matching pattern appears, and performance is measured by the number of errors.. Results from the PAL tests were reported as standardized changes from baseline and tracked over time for comparison across groups. At 6 months, HIIT outperformed LIT (effect size=0.72, P=0.004) and MIT (effect size=0.74, P=0.008). (For reference, an effect size of 0.2-0.5 is considered small; 0.5-0.8 is considered moderate; and >0.8 is considered a large effect.) The PAL score improvement in the HIIT group persisted for all of the follow-up time points after the conclusion of the intervention period, with one measurement taken at 12 months after baseline, followed by time points out to five years, presented as the average of 48-60 months. When the authors limited their analysis to only the worst performers at baseline (those with scores greater than one standard deviation above the mean in PAL scores), the HIIT group once again performed better than the LIT group and MIT group, but the effects were substantially larger (effect sizes of 1.4 and 1.7 for HIIT versus LIT and MIT, respectively). Again, this was maintained throughout the follow-up period. These results demonstrate that people with the worst cognitive performance at baseline benefited most from HIIT exercise. Is HIIT the best, case closed? This all sounds very promising, but don’t mistake these findings as a reason to drop other exercise modalities in exchange for cramming in as many HIIT sessions as possible. One major issue with the comparisons made in this study is rooted in the experimental design. While it may seem intuitive to normalize each group based on time spent in the gym, the results would actually be more comparable if the authors had normalized based on energy expenditure (i.e., metabolic equivalents, or METs). I am not surprised that the HIIT group performed better in some tests, as they did more work in the same amount of time. Let’s take a back-of-the-envelope calculation – say an MIT session has an energy expenditure of 5 METs while a HIIT session has an expenditure of 8 METs. (Of course, this is an estimate and would need to be measured in the study.) At 30 minutes per session, three days per week, and 24 weeks in the study, this would result in 180 MET-hours total for the MIT group and 288 MET-hours for the HIIT group. This experiment provides great insight for those who have limited time in the gym (e.g., three times per week, as done in the study). But for a more realistic comparison of the effect of exercise intensity, protocols should be normalized to the total amount of energy expenditure, rather than time. Another critical limitation of this study is its scope. PAL is just one of many cognitive tests – one of eight tests in the memory section alone of just one neuropsychological battery, making the scope of this study quite narrow.3 The authors report findings for four of the eight tests (working memory, delayed match to sample, and emotional recognition task, in addition to PAL), but no significant differences were found between groups in any of the other cognitive tests performed in this study. Indeed, even for the PAL test, the “practice effect” (learning through repetition) could influence results, as the test-retest reliability of PAL has been called into question in previous analyses.4 All of that to say – sure, HIIT is superior when you severely limit the scope to a small portion of cognitive function; and for those at high risk of dementia, HIIT could be quite beneficial in improving function. But, does this information allow us to make practically useful decisions when you consider a broader scope of longevity? Decidedly not. The benefits of a balanced exercise routine Familiar readers will know my framework for exercise is built on four pillars: stability, strength, aerobic base (Zone 2), and peak aerobic capacity (Zone 5). Most relevant to the discussion at hand are the latter two. High intensity training (Zone 5) has an important place in an overall exercise regimen; however, despite the results of the current study, it should not constitute the entirety of one’s exercise regimen, nor should it even consume a larger portion of time than moderate intensity training (Zone 2). This, of course, is because the benefits of exercise extend far beyond the one single cognitive domain reported by Blackmore & Schaumberg et al. I have detailed the many, varied benefits of each of the four pillars in past content, such as in my recent premium articles on Zone 2 training and Zone 5 (important to increase VO2 max) training, as well as various discussions on stability and strength. But just to highlight a few here, improving Zone 2 threshold increases fat oxidation capacity and mitochondrial function, which in turn has benefits for combating aging and reducing risk of numerous diseases, including cardiovascular disease,5 neurodegenerative disease,6 and metabolic syndrome.7,8 Stability and strength are both vital for preventing falls, a major cause of mortality in older adults, while strength training additionally improves metabolic health, bone density, and overall quality of life. So what? Is memory loss an inevitable part of aging? Are we doomed to a future of constantly searching for our glasses (which, let’s be honest, are usually on our head)? While the findings from Blackmore & Schaumberg et al. offer hope that regular exercise, particularly HIIT, might delay or even reverse cognitive decline, it doesn’t mean everyone should be doing HIIT exclusively. The results of the present study may add “associative memory and visual learning” to the list of the benefits of exercise in general for health and longevity; however, it is not clear whether this can be attributed specifically to the high intensity level of the exercise, or simply due to increased energy expenditure in the HIIT group. Without normalizing the exercise protocol to METs, we cannot know if these effects are associated with HIIT per se. Meanwhile, the list of benefits for other forms of exercise (e.g., Zone 2, strength training) had already been long, populated with effects that have at least as great an impact on lifespan and healthspan as those reported in this study. There’s still much to learn about the benefits of various exercise types and which precise balance of intensities and modalities might be optimal for different individuals, but none can be ignored completely. It’s clear that consistent exercise is crucial to aging well, and a well-balanced routine has components of moderate-intensity and high-intensity exercise, as well as strength and stability training.

Tadej was not expecting at all to win; it was a COVID year He had pretty good training, not too many races, so not too much to prove 2019 was the breakthrough year for him 2020 was a long period of doing nothing, just training He and Fabio went into the Tour as two leaders In the last week, he was fighting for the podium, for second place (he was really happy about that) The final time trial turned the table around and won the Tour “It was unbelievable. I think still a lot of people don’t believe it happened.”‒ Tadej Pogačar At the time of that final time trial, people said, “We haven’t seen a race like this since LeMond and Laurent Fignon in I think it was ’89 when he had that come behind.” At what stage in 2020 did you realize you were going to be on the podium? On the stage Col de Rousset, he was sure he was going to be second This was the queen’s stage and he was just 15 seconds behind Roglic Lopez won that stage on the high mountain Tadej explains, “I also think Roglic thought that day that he’s going to win, so yeah, you never know.” Going into that last time trial, what was your team telling you in the radio at the time checks (or even before the time checks) in terms of your delta per Roglic on a kilometer basis? Roglic was studying behind him 2 time checks on the flat before the final climb He didn’t know who was leading that time On the flat section, he got that time and even how much he was behind Then when the climb came, there were so many people, he did not hear a word in the radio; he just went Tadej explains, “I just went full gas to the top.” Did you feel anything different that day? Did it feel better than some of the other stages, or was it simply a matter of he had deteriorated more than you across 20 days? Because it was the last hard stage The next day is Mantes-la-Jolie (“you just roll through”) Tadej shares, “It’s still a hard race, but eh. If everything goes normal your GC stays the same, yeah, it was okay.” In the final time trial, he just needs to be relaxed; he thought he has earned the white jersey and was going to end up 2nd place (but he ended up winning) Tadej shares, “It was a dream, no?” Peter asks, “You didn’t feel the pressure?” Tadej didn’t feel nothing; he was really chilled out He knew the park course really well because he did recon before with Allan Pieper and Mikkel Bjerg Tadej explains, “Everybody was happy around and there was no tension, no stress, nothing, and we just rolled with it and then it was one of the best days I ever had.” Do you remember what your average power was over that time trial? On the flat, he had a power meter; but on the climb, he had nothing because he wanted to have a 6.8 kilogram bike (as light as possible by regulations) On the flat, he thinks he went 380-390 (nothing crazy) What was your weight by that point in the Tour? Were you 60 kilos? Tadej thinks he was 66 even [145.5 lbs.] Peter asks, “What did you weigh this year?” He came to the Tour with 64.5 and then 65, then 65.5, and was jumping around 65 throughout the tour [142-144 lbs.] Learning from previous mistakes [8:45] More recently in the Tour de France Peter comments that ‘21 was another amazing year In ‘22 and ‘23 Tadej had a great race, but it goes wrong in a couple stages {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Could plasma protein levels be a surrogate for VO2 max testing as a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness?",
      "content": "The evidence that increasing cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) levels positively correlates with improved mortality and morbidity is indisputable. The most accurate way of assessing CRF is by measuring the ventilation rate of oxygen during a maximal exercise test, also known as a VO2 max test. Yet maximal exercise tests have significant overhead, which makes them infeasible to perform regularly on all patients.1 Most people will have to seek out (and pay out-of-pocket for) a VO2 max test unless there is a clinical indication for exercise testing, and even if there is a clinical indication, a patient’s physical limitations might preclude them from being able to do the test. However, there may be less cumbersome ways to estimate VO2 max on the horizon. A recent study used proteomic analyses to characterize profiles associated with increasing CRF as an alternative to VO2 max tests. Proteomics Analogous to the other “-omics” fields, the goal of proteomics is to quantify the totality of the types and concentrations of, you guessed it, proteins, to associate protein profiles with a particular outcome, such as CRF. A person’s VO2 max is the integration of high-intensity exercise over a long time, meaning that VO2 max is changeable with behavior. To measure a person’s VO2 max indirectly requires a metric that can reflect changes in exercise over time. Unlike genomics, which evaluates the largely stable genome, protein concentrations are a downstream representation of genetic expression. Thus, protein concentrations can be more dynamic, giving proteomic analysis a higher potential to be a readout for CRF. About the study Several recent cohort studies have used proteomics to correlate measured plasma protein levels with cardiorespiratory fitness. However, each study had a single population with limited follow-up time. The recent study, by Perry and colleagues, used the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) trial proteomics data to create a model that outputs an integrated proteomics CRF score, using 1569 participants to develop the model and 669 to validate.2 The model was then tested to determine how well the proteomics data correlated with measures of CRF in 12,000 additional participants from three other cohorts (Fenland, BLSA, and HERITAGE trials) and another 22,000 subjects from the UK Biobank to correlate the proteomic CRF score with all-cause mortality (ACM), cause-specific mortality, and incidence of chronic disease. The UK Biobank data were also used to assess the interaction of a proteomic CRF score and polygenic risk scores for chronic diseases. How well does the CRF proteomics score predict VO2 max? Each of the cohort studies used aptamers, short single strands of nucleotides with high affinities for a protein target, to interrogate the concentration of between five to seven thousand proteins. The UK Biobank data interrogated closer to 1500 proteins using an antibody-based assay. Of the thousands of proteins quantitated, 307 were selected as markers for CRF using penalized regression methods, which “penalizes” or reduces the correlation coefficient as more and more variables (i.e. proteins) are added to the model. Selecting the proteins with the strongest correlation with VO2 max will maximize the number of proteins used while minimizing the penalty of the regression methods. The levels of the selected proteins were then used to develop an integrated proteomic CRF score. Many of the proteins used in the score have mechanistic plausibility to changes in CRF, such as leptin (which is reflective of adiposity), and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4, a protein involved with energy expenditure and fuel utilization). The integrated proteomic CRF scores had a high correlation with exercise tolerance test time in the CARDIA validation set (Spearman correlation 𝜌=0.79) and a moderate correlation (Spearman correlation 𝜌=0.67) in the combined subsequent cohorts. The correlation was higher among the subsequent cohorts (BSLA 𝜌=0.68 and HERITAGE 𝜌=0.71) that measured VO2 max from maximal exercise testing. While the Fenland study was the largest included cohort with more than 10,000 subjects, the correlation of VO2 max with CRF scores was lower in this group (𝜌=0.35), likely due to the increased variability in VO2 max estimated from using submaximal exercise methods. In other words, the proteomics CRF score is imperfect but moderately predicts a measured VO2 max. In contrast, the proteomic CRF score is much less accurate in predicting the suboptimal estimated VO2 max from submaximal exercise testing. Correlation with all-cause mortality Although the proteomic CRF scores are modestly correlated with participants’ measured VO2 max, the true value of a blood-based CRF estimate lies in its ability to predict the risk of mortality and morbidity. Regression models were used to correlate the calculated CRF score with mortality and morbidity data from the UK Biobank data (median 13.7-years follow-up). For every standard deviation increase in proteomic CRF score was associated with an 89% increase in risk of ACM (HR=1.89; 95% CI: 1.79-2.00). Decreasing CRF was associated not only with a higher risk of ACM but also with disease-specific mortality, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and cancer-related deaths. This finding aligns with previous research indicating that poor cardiovascular fitness leads to a significant increase in the risk of death. In addition to the risk of mortality, lower proteomic CRF scores were also associated with an overall higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, metabolic conditions, and neurologic conditions. Even in chronic diseases with known genetic components, a high CRF is known to mitigate the risk of disease incidence and progression. For chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, an estimated polygenic risk score (i.e., risk determined from a combination of genes related to disease) was combined with the proteomic CRF score, and results indicated an additive effect of the two scores: the highest risk of disease was observed in those with low CRF and high genetic risk. For any given polygenic risk score, a higher proteomic CRF score mitigated some of the added risk conferred by genetics, confirming that to some extent, high genetic risk for some chronic diseases can be modified by increasing CRF. Although the proteomic CRF score demonstrates a significant decrease in risk of mortality and incident disease with increasing cardiovascular fitness, it is a less dramatic difference than reported in VO2 max studies. The two largest VO2 max studies report a four to five-fold risk increase in ACM between the lowest and highest levels of CRF over 8 to 10 years of follow-up.3,4 The lowest fitness and highest fitness groups are separated by 2.5-3 standard deviations, estimated by the given percentile ranges, which for the same separation would only be an estimated 2.7-fold increase in risk of ACM by the CRF proteomic scores. Although the prediction trend is directionally the same, the magnitude of ACM risk is lower using the proteomics score, which indicates that it is not as good of a predictor of ACM as measuring VO2 max itself. Each proteomic CRF score was associated with a wide range of VO2 max values and is, therefore, less sensitive to differences in fitness. This is somewhat expected since proteomic CRF scores are based on the concentration of hundreds of proteins. For the two tests to be equivalent, each proteomic CRF score needs to be associated with a narrower range of VO2 max values, comparable to the measurement uncertainty of VO2 max testing, about 2.6 ml/kg/min.5 Proteomic changes with exercise interventions To have value for longitudinal monitoring, a proteomic CRF score must be able to reflect changes in fitness. Using data from the HERITAGE study, in which a 20-week exercise intervention was performed with repeat VO2 max testing, the investigators found that each standard deviation change in the proteomic CRF score corresponded to approximately a 0.84±0.25 ml/kg/min difference in VO2 max. Not surprisingly, the proteins that exhibited the most significant changes during this relatively short follow-up were also correlated with phenotypic changes in metabolic health, such as improved hemoglobin A1c and lower volumes of visceral adipose tissue. The dynamic response of the CRF score to an exercise intervention demonstrates that this may be a plausible way to track CRF with less overhead than repeat VO2 max testing. However, one standard deviation improvement in the CRF score is a relatively large change compared to the <1 ml/kg/min improvement in VO2 max. The HERITAGE study started with sedentary subjects and used an exercise training frequency of three times per week and slowly increased both duration and intensity over time, reaching about Zone 2 intensity for the last six weeks of the trial. The large change in CRF score may be a reflection of acute effects that occur in the first few months of beginning to exercise. Longer-term data with continued exercise is needed to assess any temporal proteomic changes that occur with improving VO2 max. Feasibility of clinical translation In addition to longitudinal monitoring, a proteomic CRF score could also be used to assess risk in people with injuries or older adults who cannot perform maximal exercise testing. When compared to standard risk factors alone (e.g., age, sex, body mass index, smoking status), the addition of the proteomic CRF score improved risk prediction for mortality, which could make it a useful clinical metric. However, requiring the measurement of hundreds of plasma protein concentrations is a potential barrier to clinical translation. To test whether proteomic CRF scores might still have predictive value when using a smaller number of proteins, the authors conducted an additional analysis using only the 21 most important proteins rather than the full set of 307. While the effect sizes of morbidity and mortality predictions were slightly lower using an abbreviated number of proteins, the abbreviated CRF score still had utility in improving risk prediction over standard clinical factors while being a reasonable test to implement in broader populations. Too good to be true? There are several (major!) limitations of the current study that need to be addressed before the proteomic CRF score can be clinically implemented. There was a five-year gap between the conduction of VO2 max testing and blood collection for proteomics analysis in the CARDIA study. Any change, whether improvement or decline, in physical fitness in this period would add variability to CRF estimates. Additionally, the model was developed from people in a limited age range (42-57). Lack of age representation in older and younger adults may reduce the predictive value for adults outside of middle age. A more robust model would be developed from concurrent measurements of proteomics and VO2 max from a wider age range of adults. The bottom line Cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by VO2 max, is one of the, if not the, best predictors of lifespan and healthspan that we currently have at our disposal. Predicting morbidity and mortality risk from standard clinical risk factors is improved by the addition of CRF metrics, but VO2 max testing is neither simple, rapid, nor inexpensive, which is why it is not conducted broadly despite its clinical value. Blood-based tests, by contrast, are well suited for longitudinal monitoring and can be performed in patients who cannot perform maximal exercise. Although measuring VO2 max from maximal exercise testing is superior in predicting mortality and chronic disease, a proteomics CRF score obtained through a blood test may be sufficient as a surrogate for VO2 max testing one day, provided the models can more accurately represent current VO2 max.

Peter asks if you blunt the benefit gained from Zone 2 training if you immediately follow it with Zone 5 Iñigo says no, because it’s done at the end, then exercise is over But don’t do it in the reverse order because this will trigger all these hormonal responses and high blood lactate We know lactate inhibits lipolysis So if you have a high interval in the middle or the beginning and you don’t clear lactate very well Another study Iñigo has under review shows that lactate at the autocrine level decreases the activity of CPT1 and CPT2 (needed for fatty acid transport into the mitochondria for oxidation) So lactate interferes with the transport of fatty acids as well Peter is glad Iñigo raised this point because often patients will say, “I went out and did a two-hour ride today and it showed me that I spent 45 of those minutes, 45 of those 120 minutes were in Zone 2. So I did 45 minutes at Zone 2” This is not the same as spending 45 minutes in dedicated Zone 2 training There is a lot of up and down intensity The average might be Zone 2, but you’re oscillating between Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 4, all the time Iñigo has done lots of testing of himself, starting at age 15 but now he gauges his Zone 2 training by sensation He is 50 now and is proud that he has the same metabolic parameters he had at age 40 Lactate, power, VO2 His VO2 is about 4 L/min When he was a cyclist his VO2 was about 4.5-4.8 It’s only decreases some which he’s really happy about because he’s not training like he did This proves to him that doing this routine helps to maintain metabolic health (1.5 hours of Zone 2 exercise ending with 5 minutes of high intensity effort, 4-5x a week) He’ll see what happens in the next 10 years §IÑIGO SAN-MILLÁN, PH.D.Iñigo San-Millán earned his doctorate at the University of the Basque Country School of Medicine.

      "content": "Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon and New York Times bestselling author, returns to The Drive to discuss his latest book, Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health. In this episode, Marty explores how a new generation of doctors is challenging long-held medical practices by asking critical new questions. He discusses the major problems of groupthink and cognitive dissonance in the medical community and delves into several of the “blind spots” raised in the book, including treatments for appendicitis, the peanut allergy epidemic, misunderstandings about HRT and breast cancer, antibiotic use, and the evolution of childbirth. He explains the urgent need for reform in medical education and the major barriers standing in the way of innovative medical research. Throughout the conversation, Marty offers insightful reflections on where medicine has succeeded and where there’s still room to challenge historic practices and embrace new approaches.

That really is the way medicine and science have to work. They have to start with ideas that we may or may not have great evidence for, but what goes wrong?” Why is there a book about this instead of a bunch of case studies of how everything has gone really well? There’s a science to groupthink, and that’s what’s really going on a lot of times It’s the bandwagon effect It’s not just in medicine, it’s in business, it’s in politics, it’s in relationships People are dead set on an idea, not because they’re convinced of it, but because they simply heard it first There was a psychologist named Leon Festinger who since passed away, but had written a tremendous amount of material on this idea of cognitive dissonance He really carved this entire discipline out in psychology The idea is that the brain doesn’t like to be uncomfortable with conflicting ideas It likes to settle and be lazy with one thought; it’s often the first thing you hear If something comes along that challenges your deeply held views or just what you’ve happened to heard before, there’s this internal conflict What the body does is it will reframe the new information to make it fit what you already believe or it’ll dismiss it completely, kind of the modern day cancel culture This happens in day-to-day life It happens in human interactions and it happens in medicine too “We get this herd mentality, but the important thing in science is that the purpose of science is to challenge deeply held assumptions. That’s something that I follow as a thread in so many areas of modern day health recommendations in this book.”‒ Marty Makary One of Peter’s takeaways from the book is what a person can do going forward How does a normal person navigate this? Peter thinks this is a hard thing to hear both as the author of the book and as a person listening Using himself as an example, he has access to more information He has a research team that can help him a answer questions If he was to challenge every idea out there, he’s not sure he’d get anything done What is the balance in your mind between when your doctor tells you something that makes sense (seems logical, plausible) but technically, you haven’t done the thinking on it? Peter asks, “How do you not allow yourself to become a crazy conspiracy theorist who doesn’t trust anything and throws out what’s 80% good in the pursuit of throwing out the 20% that’s trash? How does one navigate that?” There are extremes on both sides You see the pendulum swing, like with childbirth There’s this over medicalization of ordinary life, and then this swing back to avoid all doctors and hospitals and deliver at home with nobody It’s a dangerous proposition You see that frequently in the history of modern medicine For the everyday consumer out there, I think the flag should go up when something is put out there as a health recommendation with such absolutism as science evidence-based, when really there’s nothing to point to We don’t want to create hysteria We need people to trust doctors Marty needs his patients to trust him a lot of times, but asking questions should be part of the process There are times when we are very slow as the medical community to implement scientific evidence and it’s okay to educate the public on it How a non-operative treatment for appendicitis sheds light on cognitive dissonance [7:00] What an appendicitis is It’s inflammation of the appendix and infection sets in The tight junctions [in the appendix] break down and bacteria from the colon will creep in there and infect the appendix It becomes inflamed, and gets into the blood system in late stages 200 years ago, what was the mortality from acute appendicitis? The mortality was over 60% Walter Reed, a famous physician died of appendicitis It was a common cause of death The lifetime prevalence was not that small, 5-7% There’s a 1 in 18-20 chance you’d get an infection of your appendix and a 60% chance that if you got it, it would kill you It’s still one of the most common operations performed in American hospitals As surgeons, we have learned it as a reflex When Peter was at Johns Hopkins, he and Marty did many together You do it swiftly You do it with a laparoscope as of the last 30 year This is a reflex; we don’t even think about it in the hospital It’s been one of these easy things: diagnose, treat, diagnose, treat Diagnosis used to be tricky, because it can present a lot of ways Now, the CAT scan just points out the bullseye, and you go to work It’s a quick great case for a surgeon and a surgical trainee Then a study came out showing that you don’t need to operate, and a short course of antibiotics is 67% effective in patients that come in with appendicitis If the appendix is not ruptured or there’s no little stone (what we call a fecalith in the appendix), which is the vast majority of people Here’s a discovery that really shook up the whole field of modern surgery Peter’s recap: If you’re in the majority of cases of appendicitis, it’s not yet ruptured, and it doesn’t have an obvious mechanical cause, you can get the same outcome as surgery by using antibiotics in 60-70% of the cases If they don’t respond to an antibiotic, then you take them back to surgery (approximately a third of those people Marty explains that something like high 80% will respond to the initial course of antibiotics and only a small fraction (maybe 12%) will come back with recurrent symptoms in the first month Then you go to surgery for them The total cure is 2/3’’s By avoiding surgery The cost is reduced The patient doesn’t have to undergo an incision, anesthesia, risk of infection, risk of hernia All of which are minor risks, but they’re present Other savings: the carbon footprint of the hospital, the amount of waste produced, the nursing staffing resources, the wait list at a hospital every night Every hospital in America has cases that are waiting to go, and typically, there’s an appendix or two on that list Marty explains, “We’ve got a nursing staffing crisis. There’s so many implications to appropriately implementing this research.” Marty offered this to a kid who came to see him The study had been out for a couple of months He read it and was convinced Nobody else was really offering it at the time A 19-year-old, perfect candidate, no rupture, no fecalith, healthy guy with an early appendicitis came in They’re already getting antibiotics when they get diagnosed in the emergency department Usually you just need to run it a little bit longer Marty offers him surgery versus no surgery He tells Marty that he has to fly out the next morning to Boston for his sister’s wedding Marty thinks, “Oh, my God. What gets him to the wedding faster?” If he gets in the operating room right now, he might get there in a wheelchair He offered him both and told him what he didn’t know “I told him what I don’t know, which is I think the most important part of being a doctor is understanding the unknowns and dealing with uncertainty.”‒ Marty Makary He chose the antibiotic; he chose no surgery He goes to the wedding the next day, dances up a storm Marty becomes so convinced that this may be revolutionary; then he talks to one of his colleagues He tells one of his colleagues about it and gets the reply, “I don’t buy it.” Marty pointed him to the randomized control trial, published in a top journal He says, “I need to see two randomized control trials.” They’ve been doing this in Europe a lot longer than we’ve heard about it in the U.S. A second randomized controlled trial comes out a year later, and Marty shows it to him He says, “I need to see three randomized controlled trials.” Believe it or not, a third one came out maybe 6 months later Long term follow-up The initial study was repeated in children Other studies came out that were non-randomized Marty showed it to him and he said, “I just think you’re better with it out.” Marty thought it would be unethical to do any more research [the case for it had been made] {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "A study suggesting that exercise does not impact mortality offers little more than click-bait",
      "content": "In the world of health and longevity, there exist a handful of general guidelines that few would dispute (though opinions on specific details might differ). Keep calorie intake and fat mass in check. Don’t smoke. Get enough sleep. Stay physically active. And yet, now and then a paper comes along that claims to upend one or more of these basic tenets. Such was the case with a preprint, shared last year on bioRxiv, in which the authors concluded that physical activity is not causally related to reduced mortality.1 But although such unexpected reports make for eye-catching headlines in the popular press,2 novelty is no guarantee of quality. You might question why it’s even worth spending time delving into the details of such a study. Well, I’m often asked, “How can I develop the skill to make sense of headlines?” The answer lies in the process. You simply need the reps. You need to develop the “muscle” of going through studies in detail to understand the limitations. So, while the punchline of this newsletter should not be surprising, I hope the process of deconstruction is illustrative and serves a broader purpose. Let’s dive in. About the study Study authors Kankaanpää et al. aimed to determine the relationship between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and risk of all-cause mortality. The study involved pairs of same-sex twins born prior to 1958 from the older Finnish Twin Cohort who were 18-50 years of age at study baseline in 1975. LTPA was assessed via questionnaires mailed to participants in 1975, 1981, and 1990 and categorized as sedentary, moderately active, active, and highly active (the basis for these categories was unclear, but they are depicted in terms of MET-hours per day in the Figure below). Mortality was monitored from 1990 through 2020 using data from the Population Register Centre of Finland and Statistics Finland. After excluding those who had died prior to 1990 or did not return at least one LTPA questionnaire, the final analysis included a total of 22,750 participants. Figure: Leisure-time physical activity across timepoints and activity levels, as expressed in MET-hours per day. The dashed line indicates the minimum activity level recommended by World Health Organization guidelines. Kankaanpää et al.’s data revealed that a significantly higher proportion of participants in the sedentary group died during the 1990-2020 follow-up period than participants in any of the other three group (38.8% vs. 30.8%, 29.0% and 25.4% for the moderately active, active, and highly active groups, respectively). Relative to the sedentary group, this corresponded to a 15% risk reduction in all-cause mortality in the moderative active group (95% CI: 0.80-0.90), an 18% risk reduction in the active group (95% CI: 0.77-0.87), and a 23% risk reduction in the highly active group (95% CI: 0.70-0.84). However, the investigators report that after adjusting for other health-related variables (namely, BMI, education level, smoking status, and alcohol use), the difference in risk between sedentary individuals and those in the moderately active or active categories dropped to just 7% (95% CI: 0.88-0.99 for both comparisons), while the highly active group showed no statistically significant reduction in risk relative to the sedentary group. Further, after excluding participants who reported having angina, diabetes, or a history or heart attack prior to the start of the mortality follow-up (i.e., in either the 1975 or 1981 questionnaires), none of the three active groups demonstrated statistically significantly lower risk than the sedentary group. Based on these data, the authors conclude that apparent associations between greater LTPA and lower mortality risk are due to confounding from other health-related variables. Or to put it in their words, “rather than LTPA per se reducing the risk of mortality, being active may be an indicator of a healthy phenotype and an overall healthy lifestyle, which co-occur with a lower mortality risk.” Do we buy this argument? In terms of strengths, I can say that this study has a long follow-up period. But that’s about where the list of virtues ends. When it comes to weaknesses, on the other hand, we’re talking about a list that makes War and Peace look like a quick read. So to save us all some time, let’s just focus on two overarching issues that impair this study’s credibility: critical flaws in data collection and critical flaws in analysis and interpretation. Unreliable and insufficient data collection With the exception of mortality data, all data used to generate these findings came from self-report questionnaires in 1975, 1981, and 1990 – all long before the 30-year mortality follow-up had even begun. Even in the best of circumstances, self-reported data are subject to countless biases related to inaccurate recall, social acceptability, and other factors, but when we consider the likelihood that exercise habits reported in early adulthood or middle age will be maintained for the next 30 years, this methodology is nothing less than absurd. And it gets worse – recall that participants were only required to have returned a minimum of one questionnaire in order to be included in the analysis, and indeed, nearly half of all participants failed to respond to the 1990 poll, meaning that this study assumed that LTPA habits from 1981 (or even 1975) were maintained for the next four decades. And that’s just exercise data. How many of us have the same BMI at 65 as we had at 25? How many individuals who smoked in the 1970s may have subsequently quit as awareness spread about the negative health effects? And for that matter, how many variables with substantial implications for health weren’t assessed at all in this study? Body composition? Blood pressure? Socioeconomic status? Adherence to cancer screening guidelines? Even the restriction of physical activity questionnaires to leisure-time physical activity leaves us with an incomplete picture of the variable most central to the study – would professional dancers, personal trainers, firefighters, or other individuals with highly active “day jobs” be misrepresented by a questionnaire that specifically asks about physical activity outside of work? This certainly seems likely, considering that around 90% of participants averaged <4 MET-hours per day – roughly the equivalent of an hour of gardening. (Indeed, such low numbers are impossible according to the very definition of “MET-hours,” as one MET-hour is defined as the energy expended during one hour of rest.) Questionable analysis and interpretation Let’s go on a very shaky, very remote limb (more like a leaf, really) and assume that the questionnaires in this study did indeed paint a complete and accurate picture of each participant’s health and physical activity and that all participants’ habits and health metrics underwent no significant changes over the ensuing 30-45 years. Even if this were the case, we still can’t put any faith in the conclusion that LTPA per se has no impact on mortality risk. The authors point out that, after adjustments for the covariates of BMI, education, smoking, and alcohol consumption, the difference in risk between the three active groups and the sedentary shrinks, yet it remains statistically significant for both the moderately active and active groups. Only the comparison between the highly active group and sedentary group loses statistical significance, and this is only due to the fact that these two groups had much smaller numbers of participants than the two intermediate groups. This increases the width of the confidence interval such that it exceeds the limit of statistical significance, yet the direction of the association still favors high activity. But perhaps the most frustrating part of the analysis was the model that excluded participants with a history of angina, heart attack, or diabetes as of 1990 – i.e., the model that showed no effect of LTPA on mortality for any of the active groups relative to the sedentary group. Many studies exclude participants with health conditions at baseline, and often, this practice is perfectly acceptable – but only if the “baseline” occurs before the exposure of interest. In the present study, “baseline” for mortality (i.e., the outcome of interest) was defined as the end of data collection on the exposure of interest (i.e., LTPA), meaning that any difference in health between groups as of 1990 could have been caused by differences in LTPA. In other words, those who had been sedentary for the 15 years leading up to the mortality follow-up might have been more likely to have angina, heart attacks, or diabetes than more active groups, but in excluding those participants, we’re left with only the most healthy subset of the sedentary group but a much wider spectrum of health represented within the more active groups. This constitutes a form of bias known as “informative censoring,” in which the groups under study are defined by a variable that is directly related to the outcome. (Excuse me just a moment while I bury my head in my hands and scream…) A note on preprints At this point, it’s worth a reminder that the manuscript for this study was released as a preprint – meaning that it hadn’t been peer-reviewed prior to publication (and, as of this writing, still has not made it through the peer-review process). Preprints certainly have an important place in scientific research, as they allow researchers to share results as quickly as possible (as they circumvent the usual peer-review process, which can take months or even years). Further, since preprint servers lack the paywalls that are typically in place in peer-reviewed journals, research released as a preprint also has the potential to reach a wider audience. These advantages are vital when researchers need to communicate high-impact and time-sensitive results – such as in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, when COVID-related research was often shared prior to peer review. The presumption is that manuscripts submitted initially as preprints will subsequently be published in a peer-reviewed journal after experts have vetted the quality of the research and made suggestions for revisions. Yet many preprints never make it through this rigorous review process, and in the meantime, the information presented in them is nevertheless shared and reported in the press and social media as if it had already passed such expert critiques, increasing the risk of widespread misinformation.3 I strongly suspect that this will be the case with the present study. Indeed, the preprint for this work was released over a year ago, and while my team initially awaited the peer-reviewed version before making any critiques, it now seems unlikely that such a publication will ever come to fruition. But the stories and headlines are still out there. That’s the problem with media reporting on preprints (which says nothing about the problem of media reporting on science if they are ill-equipped to understand the nuances of what they are reporting on). Attention-grabbing, but not game-changing Several converging lines of evidence support the long-held and widespread belief that exercise is beneficial for health and longevity. We’ve covered various pieces of such evidence many times in the past (see here, here, and here, just for a few examples). Thus, reports which claim to challenge such a long-established (and well-supported) health principle are certainly capable of grabbing attention (and therefore, media headlines). But despite the click-bait appeal of contrary opinions, the mere fact that they are contrary does not make them reliable. Quite the opposite – they must be backed by such irrefutable evidence as to overcome the mountain of support for conventional wisdom. The present study, to say the least, does not meet this high bar. Indeed, it likely fails to meet even the standards required for publication in a respectable peer-reviewed journal. So although novelty and reversal of conventional opinion may attract attention, in the words of William Shakespeare, “All that glisters is not gold.” For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama References Kankaanpää A, Tolvanen A, Joensuu L, et al.

Today’s topic is hair loss, which doesn’t directly relate to lifespan or healthspan but is a common question from both podcast listeners and patients. The conversation will address: Causes of hair loss. Options to slow down hair loss or treat it once it has occurred. Summary of available treatments and guidance on choosing the right approach. How hair loss affects both men and women differently. How to find a good specialist if treatment is necessary. For most people, hair loss is noticed in different ways: Visually, through the thinning of hair density. Noticing fallen hairs on pillows or in drains. Relationship Between Hair Loss and Healthspan Although hair loss may not directly affect lifespan or traditional healthspan factors (physical or cognitive performance), it can still impact quality of life. But it can cause emotional distress, which ties it to emotional health and, indirectly, to healthspan. The prevalence, patterns, and causes of hair loss in men and women [5:15] Prevalence of Hair Loss Across Genders: Hair loss is common for both men and women, but many people are surprised by how frequently women experience it. The focus of this discussion is androgenic alopecia (AGA), which accounts for about 95% of male hair loss and at least half of female hair loss cases. Male vs. Female Hair Loss: Androgenic alopecia is the primary cause of hair loss in men and often in women, but women have other common causes of hair thinning that must be ruled out. Men: Androgenic alopecia is responsible for almost all cases of hair loss in men. Women: While androgenic alopecia can cause thinning, other factors, such as pregnancy, menopause, autoimmune conditions, stress, vitamin deficiencies, and medications, play a larger role in women. Temporary hair loss during and after pregnancy is common, but its inclusion in statistics depends on the context. Causes of Hair Loss (other than AGA) Autoimmune conditions. Psychological stress. Hormonal changes (e.g., pregnancy, menopause). Vitamin/mineral deficiencies: Iron, Vitamin D, B12. Medications: Rare cases linked to statins, antidepressants, antihypertensives. *NOTE: For most of this episode of the podcast, we’re going to be referring to androgenic alopecia Prevalence and Age-Related Hair Loss Prevalence in Men: Male pattern hair loss (AGA) affects 30-50% of men by age 50. Virtually all cases are manifest by age 40, though some men can begin experiencing hair loss as early as their late teens or early 20s. Prevalence in Women: Female pattern hair loss is surprisingly common, affecting 20-50% of women across their lifespan. It can begin as early as age 40, but in some cases, it may not start until age 60. {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Is interleukin-11 a promising new target for lifespan-extending interventions?",
      "content": "Humans have been trying to halt aging and extend maximal lifespan for millenia. According to the influential biomedical researcher Leonard Hayflick, who recently passed away at the age of 96, the quest is hopeless. Following his game-changing discovery in the 1960s that normal cells have a limit to the number of times they can divide before becoming senescent, he believed that cell senescence imposed an unbreakable ceiling on the potential length of human life at ~125 years. But what if we could interrupt or slow the processes that lead to cell senescence in the first place? Ironically, a study attempting just this strategy was published in Nature shortly before Hayflick’s death. The authors reported significant lifespan extension in mice through inhibition of interleukin-11 (IL-11), a protein thought to have a role in promoting cell senescence.1 Do these results suggest that IL-11 may have promise as a target for lifespan extension in humans? Or do they represent another example of what Hayflick believed was a fool’s errand? Laying the foundation IL-11 is a small protein involved in cell signaling and has previously been shown to be expressed more highly in centenarians than in healthy middle-aged individuals, which suggests a possible correlation with aging.2 Further, earlier work in a transgenic mouse model of premature cell senescence has indicated that senescence is associated with secretion of IL-11.3 In the present study, authors Widjaja et al. thus sought to substantiate these findings as the basis for their subsequent investigations on lifespan. Indeed, IL-11 expression was found to increase progressively throughout the mouse adult lifespan in the three tissues they sampled (liver, fat, and skeletal muscle). Additionally, molecular markers of cell senescence were upregulated in aged wild-type mice relative to young wild-type mice, but this difference was lost when comparing aged and young mice that were genetically deficient in the receptor for IL-11, indicating that IL-11 signaling is necessary for the increase in senescence associated with aging. Treatment of human cells with IL-11 in vitro also led to increases in markers of senescence. Together, these results validated earlier indications that IL-11 helps to drive the progressive increases in cell senescence seen with advancing age, which in turn suggests that IL-11 may be a promising target for interventions aimed at slowing the aging process and extending lifespan. How does IL-11 impact health and lifespan? Based on this foundation, Widjaja et al. then investigated whether interfering with IL-11 signaling might impact health and longevity in mice. The investigators treated mice with an antibody (X203) to neutralize IL-11 once every three weeks for 25 weeks, starting at 75 weeks of age – roughly equivalent to humans in their late 50s or early 60s. They found that mice treated with X203 were more glucose tolerant and exhibited lower serum cholesterol and fat mass than mice given a control treatment, as well as having greater muscle mass and muscle strength. Indeed, mice on X203 for 25 weeks (i.e., 100 weeks of age at the time of analysis) appeared healthier in these parameters than even 75-week-old mice, indicating that inhibition of IL-11 improved glucose tolerance and body composition relative to baseline rather than merely delaying age-related deterioration in these metrics. Additional experiments in transgenic mice deficient in IL-11 (Il11-/- mice) corroborated these findings. While these effects on overall health are noteworthy, most of the excitement surrounding Widjaja et al.’s work concerns the impact of anti-IL-11 therapy on lifespan. Indeed, monthly treatment with X203 from 75 weeks of age until death extended the median lifespan of mice by an average of 28.7% (Figure 1, left), with female mice exhibiting a slightly greater extension (25%) than male mice (22.5%) relative to animals treated with a control antibody. (Yes, both sex-specific cohorts showed smaller extension of median lifespan than the pooled cohort, and yes, we have verified that this is mathematically possible and doesn’t represent an error in the reported data.) Again, these results were replicated in Il11-/- mice, as genetic deletion of Il-11 was found to extend median lifespan by 24.9% on average for both sexes (Figure 1, right). (It’s worth noting that although some control animals in the genetic experiment died at unusually young ages, this would not have impacted results, as the metric of interest was median lifespan, which, unlike average lifespan, is generally unaffected by outliers. Median lifespan for all control groups fell within ranges expected based on broader literature.) Further, these Il11-/- mice and mice treated with X203 were found to have significantly lower incidence of visible tumors during autopsy than their respective control groups. Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrate extension of lifespan with either pharmacological (f) or genetic (c) inhibition of IL-11. Curves present data from pooled male and female cohorts, and shading represents 95% confidence intervals. Adapted from Widjaja et al. What’s mediating IL-11’s lifespan effects? While Widjaja et al.’s results need to be replicated, they are nevertheless compelling. A closer look at the biology of IL-11, demonstrated by the authors in additional in vitro experiments, suggests IL-11 impacts multiple downstream signaling pathways (Figure 2), including JAK-STAT3, ERK, mTOR, and others. The investigators conclude that all are likely contributing to the apparent reduction in cell senescence markers and extension in lifespan that comes with IL-11 inhibition, and indeed, all have been linked to lifespan effects in past research. But developing a more complete understanding of the relative contributions of each specific pathway and signaling target is critical to answering the question of how IL-11 inhibition might fit within the larger scope of longevity interventions. Figure 2: Downstream signaling pathways impacted by IL-11. From Widjaja et al. The lifespan extension observed by Widjaja et al. was equivalent to that observed in previous experiments with mice treated with rapamycin, a molecule that specifically targets mTOR and inhibits downstream mTOR signaling.4 (In the case of rapamycin, mice began treatment at 9 months of age, which translates to roughly half the age at which mice started X203 in the present study but is certainly less than the lifelong “exposure” of Il11-/- mice. Other studies with different durations of rapamycin treatment have also been conducted, yielding various degrees of lifespan extension.) Thus, we’re left with two possible explanations for the comparable lifespan effects of rapamycin and IL-11 inhibition: 1) the life extension associated with inhibiting IL-11 is primarily (or exclusively) attributable to a reduction in mTOR signaling, making this intervention equivalent to rapamycin; or 2) genetic or pharmacological disruption of IL-11 signaling is less effective than rapamycin at reducing mTOR signaling but nevertheless results in comparable net extension in lifespan by making up for the difference via effects on alternative signaling pathways. If (1) represents the true explanation, anti-IL-11 therapy may someday be an alternative to rapamycin depending on their relative safety and side effect profiles, but it is very unlikely to exceed the life-extending effects of rapamycin (which remain unclear in humans). However, in the event that (2) is true, anti-IL-11 therapy may represent a means of targeting entirely new lifespan-associated processes, which in turn would mean that anti-IL-11 therapy combined with rapamycin would likely have additive effects on longevity. Indeed, it would also suggest that targeting IL-11 might hold promise even if rapamycin and mTOR inhibition is eventually revealed to be a dead-end with respect to human lifespan extension. Obviously, the next experiment one would want to see is one that compares both interventions, head-to-head and in combination, though it seems unlikely such an experiment will be done. The bottom line The results by Widjaja et al. certainly offer fuel to those who believe meaningful lifespan extension is within our reach. Indeed, the extension in median lifespan observed with inhibition of IL-11 in both male and female mice is impressive and is backed by compelling mechanistic data on senescence and other markers of cellular aging. These findings hold plenty of promise, but a long road still lies ahead before we can estimate the potential utility of this new intervention for human longevity. Elucidating the cellular signaling mechanisms at play will be one of the next hurdles, along with more thorough characterization of any possible unintended negative effects, some of which may not readily be detected in animal studies. For instance, IL-11 can modulate immune function through both pro- and anti-inflammatory downstream effects, yet negative impacts on immune function are less likely to make noticeable differences in animal health and lifespan in the pathogen-free environments in which laboratory mice are housed. Thus, even if anti-IL-11 therapy gets a green light from preclinical experiments, there are no guarantees that it will be successful in human applications. But the starting point is strong, and with each step and each experiment – indeed, even those that fail – we learn a little more about the nature of aging itself. Who knows? Maybe someday it will be enough to break through the so-called “Hayflick Limit.” For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama References Widjaja AA, Lim WW, Viswanathan S, et al.

      "title": "A new blood test doesn’t change the game for colorectal cancer screening",
      "content": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States, causing nearly 53,000 deaths in 2022. This statistic may seem bleak, yet an estimated 68% of CRC deaths occurred in patients who failed to screen at appropriate intervals or to screen at all.1 In contrast to most cancers, which are only detectable by imaging tests, CRC can be detected through direct visualization during a colonoscopy. Early detection of CRC is known to improve survival, but still, many eligible people do not adhere to screening guidelines, in part because colonoscopies have a significant overhead, requiring specialized equipment and highly trained personnel. Thus, as a potentially more accessible option, a new blood-based CRC screening test was evaluated in people undergoing routine colonoscopies to determine its performance in CRC detection.2 How does the test work? When cells (including tumor cells) die, small fragments of DNA, called cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are released into surrounding tissue and eventually make their way into circulation. The new blood-based test relies on this cfDNA for CRC detection. Specifically, it estimates two scores – one based on the patient’s fraction of tumor-derived cfDNA and a second based on an integrated score of common CRC somatic mutations (e.g., mutations in the KRAS and APC genes), aberrant methylation status, and aberrant fragmentation patterns. A training set of over 4,000 samples of both healthy and CRC patients was used to develop algorithms that determine these two scores. A positive result is based on either of these scores exceeding the thresholds determined during algorithm development. What did the study find? The study recruited 7,861 participants between 45 and 84 years of age who were of average risk for CRC and were undergoing a routine screening colonoscopy. A blood sample was taken from the participants ideally within 60 days leading up to their colonoscopy. Based on colonoscopy results, 65 participants were determined to have cancer, 1,116 had advanced precancerous lesions (advanced adenomas and sessile serrated lesions at least 10 mm in the largest dimension), 2,166 had non-advanced adenoma, and 4,514 had negative colonoscopies. The total study population size was determined based on an expected prevalence of colon cancer using a much larger cohort of 22,877 participants undergoing a screening colonoscopy and the randomly selected 7,796 participants without CRC racially mirrored recent U.S. census data. Even though the inclusion of participants without CRC should be random, the prevalence of both advanced precancerous lesions was 14.1% higher in this population than the 8-9% has been previously reported, when defined as either advanced adenomas or serrated sessile lesions at least 10 mm in the longest dimension.3 Even though the prevalence of CRC in this population matched current national trends, the increased prevalence of advanced precancerous lesions indicates that this screening population may not be fully representative of the general population. Of the 65 participants with cancer, 54 were identified by the cfDNA test, which translates to an 83.1% sensitivity (95% CI: 72.2-90.3), the rate of a positive test in the presence of cancer. The test identified all Stage II (n=14), III (n=17), and IV (n=10) cancers; however, six of the 17 Stage I cancers detected by colonoscopy registered as negative by the cfDNA test, as did five of the seven confirmed cancers without complete cancer staging. Of these seven cancers without staging, five were malignant polyps (these patients are typically managed as Stage I) and two participants were lost to follow-up. The missed early-stage cancers tended to be smaller and were not detected by the cfDNA test when the largest lesion size was 9 mm or less. The detection rate of Stage I cancer was 55% when including the incompletely staged polyps, and as expected, there was an even lower detection rate for less advanced lesions. Only 147 of the 1,116 advanced precancerous lesions were identified as positive results, a 13.2% sensitivity (95% CI: 11.3-15.3). Although the test is more reliable for detecting higher-stage malignancy (indeed it seems that all stages beyond Stage I were identified), the number of patients with CRC for each stage was small enough that this conclusion cannot be definitively drawn. Furthermore, out of 6,680 participants, 698 received a positive cfDNA test when they’d had a negative colonoscopy or the subsequent histological findings were considered non-advanced. This translates to an 89.6% specificity (95% CI: 88.8-90.3), the probability of not having CRC when receiving a negative cfDNA test result. While this was the level of specificity for the cohort as a whole, sub-analyses indicated that specificity decreased with age. In participants ages 45-59, specificity was 93.4% (95% CI: 92.3-94.3), but in participants ages 70 and older, it was only 81.3% (95% CI: 78.6-83.7). This is likely because methylation increases with age, increasing the likelihood of a false positive. Due to the high rate of false positives, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 7.2%, meaning that of all people who received positive results, only about 7% had CRC diagnosed by colonoscopy. However, the prevalence of CRC in this population (0.83%) is higher than the expected prevalence of 0.5-0.7%. With a lower prevalence, the PPV of the test will be lower, as demonstrated in the Table below. The negative predictive value (NPV) of the cfDNA test was 99.8%, but since the prevalence of CRC in the pool of participants was 0.83%, the NPV improves the confidence that a negative result means an absence of CRC by 0.6%. A comparison of non-invasive CRC tests The 95% confidence intervals for the cfDNA test sensitivity and specificity are above the minimum thresholds specified for test approval by the FDA, so in all likelihood, this test will become an available option. Given the ever-growing number of non-invasive CRC screening tests (see the Table below), how does this new test stack up against others that already exist? In a population with a CRC prevalence of 0.5% (an estimate of the U.S. prevalence), there is nothing striking about the performance of this cfDNA test, and its detection of precancerous advanced adenomas (AAs) is one of the lowest rates of all the tests. The potential utility of the cfDNA test is that it is a convenient blood test for someone already at a doctor’s office. CT-colonography is the most intensive of the listed tests because it uses imaging with contrast after completing the same required bowel prep as a colonoscopy; however, it can detect CRC and AA lesions smaller than 10 mm (whereas the cfDNA test has not demonstrated this to date). Stool-based tests (e.g., gFOBT, FIT, DNA-FIT, and DNA-FIT 2.0) are convenient since they can be done at home, but most require collecting and shipping a stool sample. The benefit of the DNA-FIT tests (brand name Cologuard) is that they are more sensitive to advanced precancerous lesions and Stage I cancers than the cfDNA test. DNA-FIT tests had >85% sensitivity for Stage I CRC in both the first and second-generation tests compared to the 55% sensitivity of the cfDNA test. Although DNA-FIT tests have been approved for CRC screening for a decade, one of the barriers to stool-based CRC screening is a lack of knowledge that these options exist.4 More education and awareness about existing CRC screening options might be more effective than using tests that are less sensitive to early stage cancers. In comparison to other blood-based tests, the new cfDNA test outperforms the Septin9 blood test, which determines the methylation status of the promoter region of the septin 9 gene in cell-free DNA. The GRAIL multi-cancer early detection is the best-performing blood test for CRC, but this does not test for CRC alone, and its overall sensitivity is 14%. So while a GRAIL test might not have many false positives for CRC, you have to be willing to do follow-up cancer diagnostics for CRC and many other types of cancer. The superiority of colonoscopy All non-invasive screening options require more frequent repeat tests than a colonoscopy; some require testing as frequently as every year. Despite the convenience of at-home tests, colonoscopies are superior to other tests because they can directly visualize the colon and have the benefit of being able to identify and remove lesions during the procedure. An additional preventative benefit of colonoscopy is that the removal of precancerous lesions prevents these polyps from developing into CRC. Noninvasive screening tests like the cfDNA might be helpful in expanding the pool of individuals who get some form of screening, but positive results will still need to be followed up with the gold standard – a colonoscopy. The bottom line The ideal cancer screening test is both highly sensitive and highly specific. The newest blood-based cfDNA test has comparable overall performance to existing tests, making it better than having no screening test at all. However, the sensitivity of this test is skewed towards detecting more advanced cancers compared to the latest stool-based CRC screening methods, whereas the best chance of survival comes from catching cancer as early as possible. The low sensitivity of this cfDNA test for AAs and Stage I cancers means that, at least for now, this test won’t be an improvement over other existing options.

I mean, not that you survived (of course you’re lucky), but that it happened at all. If you could go back and push a button, have it not happen, would you push that button?” He honestly didn’t know how to answer The psychological consequences of almost dying and what he saw (remembered) on the threshold was so devastating that he absolutely felt cursed In struggling to answer, he tracked down the origin of the word blessing Sebastian is an atheist, but he feels that there are secular meanings to beautiful words like blessing or sacred The origin of the word blessing comes from the Anglo-Saxon word meaning blood The idea being that there is no blessing without a wounding, without a sacrifice And maybe there’s no wounding without a blessing And that battlefields are sacred because blood has been shed Childbirth is sacred because blood has been shed In pre-Christian Europe, often animals were sacrificed on holy days to bless fields, to bless buildings, to bless people The twinning of blessing and wounding, they’re aspects of the same thing “When I realized that, it allowed me to make an important psychological step where I stopped feeling cursed by too much knowledge” That I’d somehow gotten too much knowledge on the threshold of death and couldn’t continue daily life with that knowledge It was too burdensome, it was too scary, it was too true And once I read the origin of the word blessing, I was like, “Oh, I’m free.” It’s both; how wonderful The aneurysm that led to Sebastian’s near-death experience [6:30] Recount the story of what happened in June of 2020 and how much luck played a role in Sebastian sitting here today {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Back on the merry-go-round of bad science regarding meat consumption",
      "content": "It seems I’m back in a time loop, repeating the same old critiques of the same old flaws in studies on the same old topic. That’s right: this week has brought another round of a very familiar cycle – a cycle that starts with an observational study reporting health hazards with meat consumption, progresses to media hype, which leads to a flood of emails from concerned readers, which prompts my attempt to put the results in perspective. So what kicked off this latest trip around the merry-go-round? This week, a publication by authors Li et al. described positive associations between meat intake and risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) across various populations.1 The findings were quickly snapped up by The New York Times,2 and around we go… About the study The authors sought to investigate the potential link between consumption of meat and diabetes risk on a global scale. To do so, they conducted a meta-analysis using data from a total of 1,966,444 adults (≥18 years of age) across 31 independent cohorts included in the InterConnect project, an international research effort to explore genetic and environmental risk factors for obesity and diabetes. These cohorts represented a spectrum of global populations, with 12 of the included cohorts from the Americas (primarily the United States), nine from Europe, seven from the western Pacific/east Asia, two from the eastern Mediterranean, and one from southeast Asia. Diet information was collected via self-report, with meat consumption being divided across three categories: unprocessed red meat, processed meat, and poultry. (Consumption of fish and seafood were not classified as meat consumption in this study.) Incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) was determined from medical records, use of medication for diabetes treatment, or self-report with additional validation such as through medication prescriptions or HbA1c assays. Participants who had had a diagnosis of diabetes at baseline were excluded, as were those who reported implausible daily calorie intakes or had not provided sufficient data on relevant exposures, outcomes, or confounding variables. A total of 107,271 cases of incident T2D were recorded over the follow-up period (median: 10 years; interquartile range: 7-15 years). Increased intake of all three forms of meat was associated with statistically significant increases in diabetes risk after adjustment for covariates related to demographics, health (e.g., smoking, BMI, alcohol consumption, physical activity), and diet (e.g., consumption of fish, fiber, and sugar-sweetened beverages). Processed meat consumption showed the strongest association, with a 15% increase in T2D risk for every 50 g/day increase in intake (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.11-1.20), followed by red meat consumption (HR: 1.10 per 100 g/day increase in intake; 95% CI: 1.06-1.15) and poultry consumption (HR: 1.08 per 100 g/day increase in intake; 95% CI: 1.02-1.14). A familiar phrase to summarize familiar flaws I’ve discussed studies like this one many times in the past, and the basic flaws remain the same. Yet far be it for me to be the one to stop the cycle, so as long as these studies keep getting published, I’ll keep repeating a phrase that sums up one of the critical ways in which they fall short: correlation is not causation. The results presented by Li et al. indicate an association between meat intake and incident diabetes, but they tell us nothing about the potential causal relationships between these variables. Causality is everything in medicine (maybe life), so we must always ask ourselves this question when confronted with the data, “X correlates with Y,”: “Yes, but does X cause Y?” The notion that meat consumption causes diabetes is just one of many possible explanations for the association. When it comes to diet and disease, we have virtually limitless other variables that might influence or covary with both meat intake and diabetes risk, thus presenting countless routes by which meat intake and T2D might be correlated despite lacking any true causal link between them. Diet and disease risk are linked with numerous socioeconomic factors and other variables relevant to health which might translate to differences in baseline risk between groups. For instance, relatively high intake of processed meats is often associated with lower income due to the cheaper, more shelf-stable nature of these products (e.g., hot dogs, cured meats), and low income is in turn typically associated with poorer access to quality healthcare (as might otherwise detect prediabetes and prevent progression to T2D), as well as with lower ability to engage in other healthy behaviors such as exercising regularly or ensuring adequate intake of micronutrients. While studies attempt to “correct” for these covariates, it is impossible to do so perfectly or to account for every factor which might play a role. Furthermore, avoidance of meat (through a belief that meat is harmful – cue the endless cycle of meat-is-harmful stories), might be proxy for a slew of behaviors that are, indeed, health-promoting (e.g., more exercise, more vegetable consumption, less calorie consumption, less alcohol consumption, less processed food consumption) and, by extension, T2D-avoiding. In the specific case of the study by Li et al., we have very little insight on potential discrepancies in baseline risk, as the authors do not report baseline data on the confounding variables for which they evidently “adjusted.” However, they do share that hazard ratios associated with meat intake were substantially higher in models that excluded adjustments for BMI (HR: 1.18; 95% CI 1·07-1·29 for unprocessed red meat; HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.14-1.34 for processed meat; and HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.12-1.31 for poultry). This observation would agree with the alternative explanation that factors related to general health – rather than meat intake per se – are responsible for the apparent association between meat consumption and diabetes risk. A tenuous association As we’ve already seen, adding adjustment for BMI cuts the excess risk associated with meat consumption approximately in half, leaving us with a 10% excess risk for every 100 g/day of unprocessed red meat, 15% for every 50 g/day of processed meat, and 8% for every 100 g/day of poultry. Given that no study can account for every possible covariate, these numbers are small enough on their own to cause plenty of doubt about these correlations. But beyond their limited magnitude, these associations were also found to be inconsistent. No significant associations between incident T2D and any form of meat consumption were observed in either the eastern Mediterranean or the southeast Asian populations, though these regions had the smallest representation in the study, so these analyses may have been underpowered. More tellingly, none of the regions except Europe showed significant positive association between T2D risk and poultry intake, and even when analyzing all 31 cohorts together, further adjustments for cooking method or comorbidities at baseline abolished the positive association for poultry consumption altogether. Around and around This is the latest in a long line of observational studies reporting a link between consumption of animal meat and a negative health outcome. It certainly won’t be the last. Despite the fact that, from a nutritional standpoint, the distinction between “animal-based” and “plant-based” is rather arbitrary, it seems that every few months brings a new report of a positive association between meat intake and some scary outcome – from diabetes and obesity to cancer and heart disease. I wouldn’t be surprised if the next paper links meat intake with the likelihood of getting struck by lighting. But all of these studies have the same problem: they can’t tell us anything about causality. Diet is closely tied to innumerable cultural, socioeconomic, and behavioral variables with complicated (and not fully understood) relationships to disease risk. Li et al. made attempts to correct for other dietary variables and a few other factors related to general health, but even compared to many other observational studies in this space, the present investigation overlooked several key confounds, such as socioeconomic status or macronutrient ratios. (Indeed, even without these adjustments, the associations they report were weak at best.) So around we go again in a never-ending effort to head off alarm and outcries over meat consumption resulting from flawed studies. While there may be cultural, environmental, or religious reasons why certain individuals might choose to abstain from meat consumption, we have yet to see any meaningful evidence to support adding “health” to that list.

Where is the fat/ lean, what is the fat composed of? What is the lean composed of? Then there’s just weight, which is just your mass on this planet Those 3 things are highly related but not identical What we know indisputably and even people who sort of rail against something they call the “energy balance model” (discussed in episode #197) whether it’s really a model is unclear It’s really more of a constraint It is a constraint by which all other descriptions of what happens with weight and mass and food intake and energy and taken energy expenditure must operate It’s really a restatement of the first law of thermodynamics, which is the law of conservation Matter and energy can neither be created or destroyed but only converted It’s not a description or an explanation of what happens It just says if you describe any proposed explanation of what happens, it’s got to follow that first law of thermodynamics in order to make sense And that first law of thermodynamics in the field of nutritional obesity often gets stated as something like changes in energy storage equal changes in energy intake minus changes in energy output or delta energy stores equals delta energy in and minus delta energy out Food intake can affect those things Alternatively, you could say that energy intake is one of those things So it gets back to that descriptive thing One of the questions becomes: How does all the other aspects of food besides the mere energy content of it affect the amount of weight one gains or loses, the body composition, the tissues, where the mass is distributed, what types of tissues it’s in, composition of those tissues? Then whether or not one exceeds some threshold There’s every reason to believe that many aspects of food can influence the intake of it and other things as well From the marketing and pricing of it To the taste, the smell, the smell, the timing, what you eat it with, what it’s combined with, phytochemicals in it, micronutrients, macronutrients All can affect energy expenditure, subsequent energy intake or nutrient partitioning Which is a fancy phrase for where you stick the energy that you store in the body Do you stick it into fat or muscle or bone or visceral fat or subcutaneous fat, etc. “The truth is, I think what we know is modest, and partly that’s because it seems to me to be very specific.”‒ David Allison When you do a study and find in this species with this delivery of this composition in this way, this thing happens When you look in a different species or a slightly different food, you get different results Even when it’s well done and honestly done So there’s many, many studies saying, “Well, we got this with pea protein and casein but not whey. Or we got it with whey but not casein. Or we got it when we fed it 2 hours before the test meal, but not 1 hour before. Or we got it in men but not in women.” David’s conclusion: This makes me think we’re talking often about subtle effects that may not be that clinically reliable and meaningful. And so the really big effect seems to be how many calories do you eat? All these other aspects of food may then influence how many calories you eat, either of that food or in subsequent occasions And those can seem to have big effects, but we’re still sort of trying to suss those out The slow progress in addressing obesity and public health despite substantial effort and investment [7:30] Peter asks, “Do you ever spend time interacting with physicists or chemists, biochemists who sit on the sidelines and sort of look at the field of human energetics and wonder to themselves, ‘Why is there so much noise and why is there so little understanding?’” Peter doesn’t think anybody is blaming the scientists What do you think it is at the meta level that explains the obvious but important observation that our knowledge in this space is woefully deficient relative to the effort that has been put into elucidating truth? For example, why do we know very little relative to the same amounts of effort that have gone into physical sciences? There are many reasons; some are perceptual and some are actual Perceptual: do we really know that much less? In physics, how is it that relativity and quantum physics are compatible; or is dark matter real? We don’t’ give ourselves credit for certain things In physics, there’s not a lot of discussion in modern times of the power of Newton’s, universal law of gravitation It was figured out a long time ago and we take it for granted Some simple examples at the practical level in energetics In most industrialized countries, there’s very little food shortage It’s a big deal that we know that alcohol contains calories (we take that for granted) Wilbur Atwater who stated the caloric content of alcohol was vilified for it at the time by the Temperance Movement He himself was a teetotaler by the way that alcohol had no nutritional value Folate supplementation, which has radically reduced spina bifida Iodized salt, micronutrient deficiencies being maybe not eradicated in this country, but radically reduced a Other supplementation and greater food safety We’ve made a lot of practical progress We’ve been feeding a number of people through nutrition and agriculture More recently in the 1970s when we were told there was going to be a population explosion that would threaten our ability as a species Peter asks, “But isn’t that really more about agriculture than nutrition science?” It’s agriculture, it’s food science Some of the nutrition science is more the micronutrients All the way back to eliminating scurvy through the work of James Lind and figuring out eventually that it was vitamin C They first thought it was just citrus in general They didn’t assume it was the vitamin C To the folate and so forth, David thinks our notions, our understanding about LDL-cholesterol is very important The role of saturated fats and that we’re still learning more, but we do know some things about that {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Coronary atherosclerosis is a silent killer, but we have tools to stop it",
      "content": "Recently, the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics released its preliminary report on mortality data from 2023. Once again, heart disease reigned supreme as the leading cause of death in the United States1 – a sorry distinction it has held firmly for the last two decades. Heart disease – and more specifically, coronary atherosclerosis, which is responsible for the majority of deaths from cardiovascular disease – is easily the most preventable of all the “four horsemen of chronic disease” (i.e., heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and metabolic disease). It is caused by apoB-containing lipoproteins (90-95% of which are low-density lipoproteins, or LDLs), which penetrate artery walls and initiate atherogenesis. Thus, therapies for lowering circulating LDL levels – such as statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and others – have the power to virtually stop atherosclerosis in its tracks. So why does this disease remain a top killer? A study published last month provides some insights, along with further evidence of the importance of lowering LDL as a means of preventing atherosclerosis-related mortality.2 About the study Study authors Faridi et al. analyzed data from the Miami Heart Study, which involved participants who were 40-65 years of age and free of any clinically evident cardiovascular disease (CVD) at enrollment.3 From this cohort, the present study excluded any participants with additional risk factors for atherosclerosis, including hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg), diabetes, or tobacco use, as well as any individuals who were taking lipid-lowering medications. This left Faridi et al. with a final cohort of 1,033 participants (median age of 51 years at the time of enrollment; 55% women) with no CVD symptoms and at relatively low risk based on the exclusion criteria. As part of the original Miami Heart Study, participants had undergone cardiac imaging tests at baseline, including coronary artery calcification (CAC) scans and contrast-enhanced coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. Laboratory tests were also performed to assess baseline blood lipids. In the present study, Faridi et al. utilized these cross-sectional baseline data to determine the prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis among low-risk, asymptomatic adults, as well as to characterize its associations with atherogenic lipoprotein concentrations as estimated by LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) or non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), or directly measured by apoB levels. A high prevalence of atherosclerosis in low-risk adults Despite their evident “low risk” status, over one third (35.9%) of participants included in the analysis were found to have coronary plaque, while roughly one quarter (25.3%) had a CAC score over zero – an indication of the presence of early-stage artery calcification. Additionally, a smaller set of participants were found to have more advanced CVD, with 4.5% having CAC scores ≥100 (indicating moderate disease), 3.4% showing evidence of high-risk plaque, and 1.9% demonstrating artery blockage of at least 50% according to CCTA scans. The proportion of participants with coronary plaque increased with increasing serum levels of LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB (see Figure below). Specifically, after adjusting for covariates, each 10 mg/dL increase in LDL-C was associated with a 13% increase in risk (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.08-1.18), each 10 mg/dL increase in non-HDL-C was associated with a 12% increase in risk (OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.08-1.16), and each 10 mg/dL increase in apoB was associated with a 20% increase in risk (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.13-1.27). The somewhat stronger association between plaque and apoB compared to associations with LDL-C or non-HDL-C is in line with expectations, as atherogenesis depends on the number of apoB-containing lipoproteins (as indicated by apoB levels) rather than on their cholesterol content (as indicated by LDL-C or non-HDL-C). Importantly, the increases in risk with increasing lipoprotein levels appeared to be linear down to at least 70 mg/dL LDL-C – well below the American Heart Association’s current guideline of <100 mg/dL as an “optimal” value.4 Across lipoprotein strata, risk was also observed to increase with age and was higher among men than among women, which agrees with earlier reports on sex differences in atherosclerosis progression and adverse cardiovascular events.5 Figure: Prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis among low-risk adults based on serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. Prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis (as detected by CCTA) and coronary artery calcium (as detected by CAC scan) is shown as a percentage of participants within each stratum of lipoprotein levels. Cholesterol values are in mg/dL. Adapted from Faridi et al. 2024.² The authors also performed analyses on a subgroup consisting of the very lowest-risk participants, defined by more stringent risk factor thresholds than the full cohort (e.g., systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure <80 mm Hg, BMI <25 kg/m2). Within this subgroup (n=184; 83.7% women), prevalence of coronary plaque was lower than in the full cohort but still alarmingly common, as it was observed in 21.2% of these “optimal risk” participants. CAC scores above zero were reported for 14.7% of the subgroup, though none of these participants demonstrated CAC scores ≥100 or ≥50% artery blockage. A silent but avoidable killer In all, Faridi et al.’s results reveal a startlingly high prevalence of early- to moderate-stage coronary atherosclerosis among patients classified as “low risk” with no reported symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. Further, they show that higher levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins were associated with higher risk, even when comparing levels below those regarded as optimal by current guidelines. While this was an observational study based on cross-sectional data and on its own tells us nothing about any causal relationship between apoB and cardiovascular disease, these results align with a large, consistent body of evidence indicating that apoB-containing lipoproteins drive the development of atherosclerosis – and that reducing serum levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins, for instance with statins or PCSK9 inhibitors, can slow or halt the progression of this disease and help to prevent subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes. Thus, we return to the question posed at the start of this piece – why is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease so deadly despite the existence of effective treatments? The results of the present study suggest a simple (albeit alarming) answer: millions of individuals with this disease are likely unaware of it. Atherosclerosis develops over decades of exposure to high levels of circulating apoB-containing lipoproteins, yet for those who are relatively young or otherwise healthy, both patients and physicians often ignore the possibility of coronary artery disease, failing to test for it via CAC or CCTA scans even when LDL-C is known to be elevated. Faridi et al.’s data show that apparent health is no guarantee of the absence of CVD, and as we’ve seen in a previous newsletter, being proactive about lipid and imaging tests – and following up with appropriate treatments – can literally be the difference between life and death. On a population scale, these actions have the power to put an end to mortality from coronary atherosclerosis. One horseman down, three to go.

      "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter dives into two important health topics: uric acid and protein, examining them from unique perspectives. For uric acid, he explores its metabolic role and connection to various diseases, focusing on the potential causal link with cardiovascular disease. He also discusses factors influencing uric acid levels, such as diet, genetics, and lifestyle, providing practical tips for effective management. Shifting to protein, Peter delves into its role in appetite and weight management, the consequences of insufficient protein, and the “protein leverage hypothesis” linking protein deficiency to obesity. He covers optimal protein intake and its impact on energy expenditure, and he compares the satiety effects of solid versus liquid protein. Finally, Peter shares his strategy for incorporating protein into a comprehensive weight management plan.

Peter’s rebuttal: “I would bet that the same number of people who think that the fanny pack is a faux pas are probably equal in proportion, not necessarily the same people, but equal in proportion to the number of people who think HRT causes breast cancer or TRT causes prostate cancer… …And so it requires deep, thorough, nuanced discussion to explain the merits of certain approaches, and I think the fanny pack is no exception.” Episode topics: Uric Acid Discussion: Nick mentions the renewed focus on uric acid due to new information, covering its relation to diseases and metrics for Peter and his patients. Protein Discussion: Nick introduces the discussion on protein and its relationship to appetite, energy expenditure, and weight control, highlighting new aspects not previously covered. Understanding uric acid: its role in metabolic processes, its association with gout and kidney stones, its impact on blood pressure, and more [6:00] What is uric acid? Why should people even care about this metric? Uric acid is often seen on blood tests, though not commonly ordered. Familiarity mainly comes from its association with gout. But let’s just take a step back and talk about what it is… Metabolite Breakdown Uric acid is a byproduct of purine breakdown. Purines are DNA and RNA building blocks; their breakdown leads to uric acid production. Fructose connection Uric acid is also a metabolite of fructose In a previous convo with Rick Johnson, they talk at length and in great detail about the biochemical pathway that leads from the metabolism of fructose to uric acid. Evolutionary aspect: Genetic Mutation A specific mutation in humans allows higher uric acid levels compared to ancestors. Possibly linked to a survival advantage during extreme cold periods in Europe. Uric acid and pathology Gout Most of our understanding of it of course is associated with pathology and most of that pathology centers around gout. So when uric acid crystallizes, it can do so in joints, and because it is quite inflammatory when it crystallizes, this inflammatory condition within the joints is what is clinically known as gout. Commonly affects the big toe and requires potent anti-inflammatory drugs. Kidney stones High uric acid levels can lead to urate-based kidney stones. Less common but significant in the types of kidney stones. High blood pressure Hyperuricemia is linked to increased blood pressure. Established through experimental evidence and Mendelian randomization. Mendelian Randomization (MR) MR is used to study causality between biomarkers and disease phenotypes. Helps clarify if lowering biomarkers like LDL or uric acid reduces disease risk. Example of causal relationships found: Lowering LDL has been causally linked to reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Similar MR studies show that uric acid levels correlate with blood pressure changes. Confounding factors All of this is confounded by the fact that things that are bad for you tend to raise uric acid and that association is a little difficult to tease out causality. For example, we know that patients with fatty liver disease and patients with type 2 diabetes usually have very high uric acid levels and it’s unclear exactly what the direction of causality is there. Non-modifiable factors that influence uric acid levels [11:00] Non-Modifiable Factors Sex Differences Men generally have higher uric acid levels than women (0.5 to 1 mg/dL higher on average). {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "A recent study does little to supplement earlier knowledge on multivitamins and health",
      "content": "It’s a familiar sight in any pharmacy or grocery store: a wall of multivitamins in countless brands and formulations, marketed for a variety of health benefits. Approximately one third of all American adults report taking multivitamins, making them the most commonly used dietary supplements in the US.1 Their popularity presumably stems from a widespread belief that they promote general health and help to prevent chronic disease, which in turn may extend lifespan. Yet a recent study has called into question these alleged benefits of multivitamins.2 The study results, which were picked up by various mainstream news outlets, have left many consumers wondering if they are wasting their money – or worse, if their use of multivitamins might even be slightly harmful for health. But can we really put any stock into these recent findings? About the study Researchers Loftfield et al. analyzed data from three US-based prospective cohort studies – the National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study (NIH-AARP) cohort; the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial cohort; and the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort – in order to investigate the relationship between long-term multivitamin (MV) use and mortality. The investigators specifically selected participants from these cohorts who were in relatively good health at baseline (e.g., free of any history of cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular events), and after applying these and other exclusion criteria, they were left with a total participant pool of 390,124 adults: 327,732 from the NIH-AARP cohort; 42,732 from the PLCO cohort; and 19,660 from the AHS cohort. MV use and demographic data were assessed through questionnaires at baseline and various follow-up points, with Loftfield et al. stratifying MV use across three categories: non-users, non-daily users, or daily users of MV. Participants were followed until their death (as determined from the National Death Index), loss to follow-up, or the study’s end. Follow-up time was divided into two phases, with follow-up period 1 (FP1) representing the first 12 years and follow-up period 2 (FP2) representing the last 15 years of follow-up. In total, there were 7,861,485 person-years of follow-up, over which a total of 164,762 participants died. Over this time, daily MV users were found to have a 4% higher mortality risk than non-users (FP1: HR=1.04; 95% CI: 1.02-1.07; FP2: HR=1.04; 95% CI: 0.99-1.08) after adjusting for sex, age, race & ethnicity, education, marital status, BMI, cigarette smoking, daily alcohol intake, daily coffee intake, healthy eating index quartile (HEI-2015), family history of cancer, and individual supplement use. In addition to all-cause mortality, the authors also analyzed associations between MV use and cause-specific mortality from cancer (49,836 deaths), heart disease (35,060 deaths), and cerebrovascular diseases (9,275 deaths). Daily MV use was reported to be associated with a 6% increase in risk of deaths from heart disease, though this was exclusively observed in FP1 (HR=1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.11). No other significant differences in risk between daily or non-daily MV use and non-use were observed for deaths from any specific causes included in the analysis. Based on all of these findings, the authors concluded that use of multivitamins confers no benefit to lifespan and instead may increase mortality risk relative to non-use. A questionable result with a large potential for bias Before you start throwing your multivitamins in the trash, let’s first take a closer look at these results. The authors report a 4% higher mortality risk with daily MV use relative to non-use at both the first and second follow-up points, but this was only statistically significant at FP1, and as we’ve seen, no sustained, significant differences were observed in mortality from any specific causes. Further, this miniscule difference was overshadowed by a larger difference between non-daily MV users versus non-users (HR=1.09; 95% CI: 1.05-1.13) at the first follow-up, which disappeared completely by FP2 (HR=0.95; 95% CI: 0.88-1.02). In all, this reveals that the so-called “increase in risk” with MV use reflects an inconsistent association with no apparent dose-dependency – raising the likelihood that this result was due to random chance or bias, rather than to a true positive association. But even if we determine that the 4% increase in risk is unreliable, can we still conclude based on these data that multivitamins offer no benefit? Unfortunately not. One of the great challenges with research on dietary supplements is the potential for either “healthy user bias” (in which individuals who are more health-conscious and are engaging in several healthy behaviors may be more likely to take MVs) or “sick user bias” (in which those with an existing disease may be more likely to take MVs due to perceived health benefits). Loftfield et al. acknowledged this concern but claimed to have addressed it effectively by collecting data on – and adjusting for – variables such as BMI, smoking status, alcohol intake, and diet. However, observational studies such as this can never account for every variable related to health. For instance, body composition and use of other medications were not assessed. Thus, the risk of substantial influence from healthy or sick user bias cannot entirely be excluded. The authors also chose to focus on participants who were relatively healthy at baseline, excluding those with a history of cancer, diabetes, heart disease or stroke, or late-stage kidney disease. This, too, might have been intended to minimize the effect of sick user bias, but it leaves us with a cohort of unusually healthy older adults, and the effect of this selection may differ between groups. Because the median age of participants in this study was 61.5 years, participants had potentially already gone through over half a lifetime of either taking or not taking MVs, which could have caused health separation between groups before baseline in such a way that would make one group more susceptible to this “healthy participant” selection bias than the other. For instance, if MVs do have a positive effect on general health and disease prevention, then those who have never taken MVs would be more likely to develop diabetes/cancer/etc. by age 60 than those who take MVs every day. This study’s exclusion criteria would then mean that, of all non-users, only those who didn’t develop these diseases by the study start – i.e., the very healthiest among this group – would be included in the analysis, whereas the sample of MV users included in the study would be more representative of all MV users. Were some benefits missed? An additional consequence of this study’s exclusion criteria is that we miss any opportunity to determine how the use of MVs might be associated with mortality in the context of poor baseline health or of specific disease states. Some evidence indicates that certain supplements may have more potent or qualitatively unique benefits when used in the context of specific health concerns as compared to regular use in a state of wellness. (For example, omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to improve recovery of neurological function after stroke.3) Likewise, it’s also possible that MVs would provide substantial benefits only when an individual is deficient in certain vitamins and minerals, a common occurrence which often goes unnoticed. Additionally, risk for some causes of death may be more impacted by supplement use than others. Cause-specific mortality in this study was only evaluated for deaths due to heart disease, cancer, or cerebrovascular disease, but other common causes of mortality arguably have much stronger links to micronutrition (e.g., calcium and vitamin D impact bone health, which in turn impacts risk of falls and frailty-related accidents, a major cause of mortality in older adults). Had separate analyses been conducted specifically in individuals with diseases thought to be improved through various supplements, perhaps MV use would have been found to reduce overall mortality risk or mortality due to specific causes. Bottom line The authors of this study claim that their results show that the use of multivitamins offers no benefit for reducing mortality risk, and in fact, that daily use of multivitamins may confer a 4% higher mortality risk than non-use. However, questionable data and various biases make these results unreliable, and ultimately, this study tells us nothing about how multivitamin use may or may not be associated with mortality in a general population. Even if MVs don’t offer any mortality benefit (which we can’t conclude from this study for all of its flaws), this still doesn’t mean they serve no purpose for human health. There’s no question that supplements improve various aspects of health in the context of vitamin or mineral deficiencies, for instance, and compelling evidence links certain vitamins and minerals to reduced risk of particular health concerns such as osteoporosis even in otherwise healthy individuals, which may in turn impact mortality from specific causes. Are multivitamins the be-all, end-all key to longevity? Certainly not. But whether or not they move the needle in this regard remains an open question – and this present study did little to add to the conversation.

We can say lactate The body does not make lactic acid ‒ that has been a hundred-year mistake Lactate is not just an innocent bystander; it’s a participant in the process of powering muscle and all cells 100 years ago, Otto Meyerhof made a seminal discovery; tell us a little about what that was and how that started a chain of understanding that brought us to where we are today In the early 20th centuries, people were trying to unite what was known from fermentation technology to what was coming out of studies of muscle metabolism Meyerhof was a great man, a great investigator, and one of the things he did was to quantify how much glycogen is in muscle And how when it degrades, it produces lactate (at that time thought to be lactic acid) The experimental set up that Meyerhof and colleagues used was half a frog in a jar without oxygen supplementation, without any perfusion that has blood flow In this half a frog, the muscles were made to contract, and they contracted until they couldn’t contract anymore Then quantitatively, Meyerhof could say, well, there was X amount of glycogen and there was X amount of lactate produced Figure 1. That was really instrumental in developing this pathway But if you look at this, this is really not what we are These muscles are made in nature to contract once or twice The frog hops; it gets away or gets eaten The muscle is not representative of us But in this situation, they stimulated the muscle to contract It stimulated glycolysis to produce ATP And at the end the muscle fatigues And at the end there was a lot of lactate and there was also a lot of acid This is how he came to associate lactate (or lactic acid) production and oxygen lack (because there was no oxygen around here), and this led to the idea of lactic acidosis and the anaerobic threshold and the oxygen debt But if you just look at this simple, simple apparatus where we have a half a frog made to contract, this is really the aegis of our understanding of how carbohydrate is used in the body Most textbooks talk about: glycolysis goes on to make pyruvate and when there’s no oxygen → lactic acid [anaerobic glycolysis shown in the figure below] Figure 2. Anaerobic glycolysis (produces lactate) versus aerobic glycolysis (which occurs in the mitochondrion). Image credit: Nature Reviews Cancer 2004 This has been a problem, and it spills over not only into muscle physiology, but it spills over into pulmonary medicine It spills over into cardiology It spills over into nutrition We know a lot of things that could not be known at that time Peter’s recap Some folks couldn’t see that image, but it was basically a schematic of an experiment The musculature of part of a frog is put into an anaerobic chamber (with no oxygen), and it’s not perfused (so there was no blood to carry hemoglobin to carry oxygen to the muscles) Presumably electrodes were placed somewhere on the musculature within the chamber and the electrodes provided the stimulation for muscle contraction The question became: what is it that fueled the contraction? Obviously, it’s the glycogen within the muscle But if glycogen (or glucose) is being used to fuel contraction without oxygen, it somehow must be happening in the absence or exclusion of the mitochondria And so what they were measuring was the consumption of glycogen, the production of lactate, and presumably they could measure the pH in the solution Peter is assuming that the pH, which is a measure of acidity, was going down Peter asks, “And so the interpretation of that observation was what at the time?” “But since then, people have associated the appearance of lactate with oxygen lack. That’s a mistake.”‒ George Brooks First of all, that was important in terms of quantifying glycolytic pathway precursor and product You start with a certain amount of precursor, you wind up with a certain amount of product There was no oxygen there It’s a stress-strain kind of relationship The muscle is stressed to perform, and it uses what it has (glycogen) It produces lactate and there is also an acidosis There’s association with lactate and lactic acidosis and fatigue; this whole thing was boiled up in one knot When George learned exercise physiology, it was all those same things: fatigue, acidosis, lactic acid Peter asks, “In the experiment that Meyerhof did almost exactly 100 years ago, at some point I assume the frog’s leg stopped contracting in the presence of the stimulus. And is it believed that that was due to a depletion of glycogen, or was it believed that the degree of acidosis had become so significant that the acidosis crippled in some way the actin and myosin filaments of the muscle and prevented either further contraction or relaxation?” Exactly, at that time, people were trying to understand why muscles contracted, and it was just a simple kind of thing like, let’s have tea Would you like tea with cream or would you like it with lemon? Oh, I would like with both. So right then you get this curdling, the acidosis One idea of muscle contraction was that actually the actin and myosin kind of curdle and then they have to uncurdle So it was believed that the accumulation of lactic acid, caused fatigue When you look back at that experiment, what do you believe was the explanation for why the frog’s muscles ceased to contract in the presence of an ongoing stimulus? Peter asks this so people can understand how George thinks about this problem today based on the entirety of his work George thinks there was ATP and creatine phosphate depletion in this anaerobic environment Peter asks, “By the way, in an experiment of that nature, how much does the pH go down?” George doesn’t think they reported pH, but he pH would probably go just a bit under 7 Peter explains for folks listening who aren’t familiar with pH, the number can be as low as 1 and as high as 14 [shown in the figure below] Physiologically in a mammal, it’s very hard to get too much below the high 6s and too high above the high 7s Physiology tends to exist in the 7s with 7.38 being perfectly neutral The higher the number, the more basic, and the lower the number, the more acidic <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-25584\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/f3-georgebrooks-1024x638.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"638\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/f3-georgebrooks-1024x638.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/f3-georgebrooks-300x187.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/f3-georgebrooks-768x478.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/f3-georgebrooks.png 1146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" /> Figure 3. The pH scale. Image credit: Natural Bio Health A funny anecdote (maybe not so funny), but common story when Peter was training in surgery When trauma patients are brought into the trauma bay, one of the pieces of data that the paramedics have on the way in is the pH They can measure blood pH very quickly and easily, and that became a way that we would triage readiness in the ICU and in the operating room When gunshot wound victims or stab victims were being brought in, even if they were alive, if their pH was seven or 6.9, we knew that it was very unlikely that they would survive even if their heart was still beating at the moment that that was reported to us Peter can think of 1 case that was a miraculous case where a guy was brought in with a pH of 6.9 on arrival and he managed to survive It is funny how the body really, really regulates acid-base balance Let’s fast-forward a little bit ‒ Meyerhof won the Nobel Prize for that observation in 1922 We sometimes refer to him as the father of physiology or the father of muscle physiology or the father of exercise physiology He was awarded it along with A.V. Hill, and A.V. Hill is a very famous name in physiology Peter doesn’t remember exactly when Warburg made his seminal observation, but he’s guessing it was about 2 decades later (in the 1940s) Otto Warburg was actually Meyerhof’s professor in Germany The Warburg effect with cancer cells: cancer cells will take sugar (glucose) and make lactate, and they do that under fully aerobic conditions (under room air, where the oxygen is actually higher than it ever is in the body) And these cancer cells will just break down carbohydrate, break down glucose Quantitatively, you wind up with this lactate and acid If you look at the glycolytic pathway, at the end is this pyruvate anion and a proton NADH, (this redox carrier), it gives us lactate anion and NAD+ So the last step in glycolysis does not make acid; it’s actually an alkalizing step [see the figure below, since NAD+ carries the H+ ion, acid is not produced] <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25585\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/f4-georgebrooks.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"654\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/f4-georgebrooks.png 654w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/f4-georgebrooks-300x252.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: px) 100vw, px\" /> Figure 4.

Brooks, Ph.D.George Brooks earned his PhD at the University of Michigan where he studied mitochondrial energetics under John Faulkner. He then completed a postdoctoral fellowship in muscle biology at the University of Wisconsin. Dr. Brooks is a Professor of Integrative Biology at UC Berkeley and the director of the Exercise Physiology Lab. Dr. Brook’s research focuses on metabolic adjustments in response to exercise. He was the first scientist to propose the “lactate shuttle” theory in the 1980s, positing that lactate was actually a fuel source, rather than an unfortunate byproduct of exercise. He works in both animals and humans to elucidate the pathways and controls of lactic acid formation and removal before, during and after exercise. In addition to basic research, he collaborates with others to identify the causes and develop treatment modalities for conditions in lactic acidosis in persons suffering from injuries and infections such as traumatic brain injury, heart failure, inflammatory conditions, and HIV infection. He also conducts research on the “crossover concept” to understand how the body selects combinations of fatty acids, carbohydrates and amino acids for use during sustained exercise and other conditions. This work investigates the effects of exercise training, gender, age, and high altitude on substrate utilization. The results have direct implications for the prevention and management of metabolic inflexibility that contributes to obesity and type 2 diabetes in youth and aging. Dr. Brooks has published more than 400 manuscripts throughout his decades-long career in exercise physiology research and has authored two textbooks, including Exercise Physiology: Human Bioenergetics and Its Applications.

      "title": "Oldies-But-Goodies, August 2024 Edition",
      "content": "This week, I’m sharing another collection of oldies-but-goodies – pieces from our newsletter archive that address a variety of topics of continued interest to our audience. Some provide additional context for recent or upcoming content; some address frequently asked questions; and some are simply worth repeating for anyone who might have missed them. The world of biomedical science is constantly evolving, but in evaluating what has changed, we like to pause now and then to acknowledge information and ideas that have remained relevant despite the passage of time – a celebration of “aging well,” if you will. How to make better decisions: understanding bias vs. noise Overall error in decision-making is a function of two variables: bias and noise. These terms come up frequently on the podcast and throughout our content, and understanding the logic behind many of our analyses and critiques of scientific literature requires an understanding of the difference between these two variables. In this piece from November 2021, I discuss key points from an essay explaining bias versus noise, as well as how to recognize and account for each in order to optimize decision-making and analysis. Vitamin D(éjà vu): new study, same old problems Vitamin D is a common topic of listener questions, particularly since our recent release of an “Ask Me Anything” episode on the health effects of sun exposure. Yet clinical trials on the effects of vitamin D supplementation are often plagued by confounds and flaws in study design. In discussing a trial on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone fracture risk, this newsletter from two years ago points out many such flaws that are widespread in vitamin D literature, explaining how they might undermine interpretation of results. Muscle mass and cognitive function The importance of skeletal muscle mass for avoiding frailty and maintaining metabolic health into old age is a frequently recurring message on The Drive and in these newsletters, but we must not forget that the benefits of muscle mass for health also extend beyond these domains. In this piece, we turn our attention to the link between muscle mass and cognitive health, summarizing a narrative review of potential mechanisms by which a loss of muscle mass might contribute to cognitive decline. While causality in the association between low muscle mass and cognitive decline has yet to be firmly established, mechanistic support for a causal relationship has continued to build since this piece was originally released in October 2022, underscoring the importance of maintaining muscle mass as we age. To reduce appetite, skip late-night snacks “Optimal” diet pattern – including meal timing – is a topic of perennial interest among listeners, but understanding the true effects of dietary changes often requires multiple research approaches in order to evaluate both efficacy (how the intervention performs in an ideal, strictly controlled setting) and effectiveness (how an intervention performs in a real-world environment). Thus, this newsletter discusses two complementary studies on the effects of late-night eating, which together reveal that this practice increases appetite and reduces energy expenditure. In addition to this message, this piece may also provide helpful context for anyone tuning in to my upcoming podcast interview with Dr. Eric Ravussin, an expert in the areas of calorie restriction, obesity, and metabolic health. A case study on the importance of taking charge of one’s own health Though I often point to statistics and clinical research to demonstrate the importance of being proactive about health assessments and aggressive in combating cardiovascular disease, I know that sometimes, the stories of specific individuals can be a far more effective way to convey this message. Thus, when a Drive listener reached out last year with an example from his own experience as to the life-saving power of taking initiative for cardiovascular health, I asked his permission to share it via this newsletter. I find the story as moving now as I did then, and my hope is that it might inspire readers to follow his lead in taking action for one’s health.

[3:45] new section It’s a word that gets thrown around a lot, and it means different things to different people Peter tends to think of thing mathematically, and longevity is made up of 2 vectors: lifespan and healthspan Lifespan is much easier to understand because it is discrete, it is binary, it is objective For the most part, you’re either alive or you’re dead Think of it through the lens of a death certificate An edge-case would be an individual who is brain-dead but being kept alive (we could debate whether that person is dead or alive) Notice that lifespan says nothing about the quality of a person’s life Lifespan is one of the vectors of longevity In as much as we want to increase longevity, we presumably want to have something to do with increasing lifespan The second vector that makes up this longevity function is the healthspan vector Healthspan is far more complicated to explain It is far more subjective It is analog as opposed to digital, meaning it is not discrete on, off It is variable Peter likes to think about it as having 3 components: a physical component, a cognitive component, and an emotional component In an early version of Outlive (not the final version that got published), Peter went to great lengths to describe the cardiorespiratory death as type I death Then he went into great machinations to talk about the 3 types of decline in healthspan as physical, cognitive, and emotional death Everybody really pushed back on that (for good reason), and they thought it was a little too morbid to talk about physical death as the death of your exoskeleton and cognitive decline Peter thinks they were right, that death was probably too strong a word there His point was: a person can be robbed of all of those things and still be technically alive, although their quality of life has been sapped Thinks of 3 subvectors of the vector of healthspan: physical health, cognitive health, and emotional health There are ways we can quantify each of these Ultimately people will have their own subjective assessment of what it means to be physically healthy or what it means to be cognitively healthy, or what it means to be emotionally healthy 2 of 3 of these subvectors decline with age: the physical and cognitive components That doesn’t mean that everybody’s decline at the same rate That doesn’t mean that for everybody, the decline reaches a level that is “pathological” Peter was thinking about this in the gym today, “Wow, it is really so obvious to me with each passing day that I am completely past my prime physically and cognitively. And I will never again be as physically strong, fit, flexible, free of pain… I will never again reach the pinnacles that I had reached in my late teens and 20s.” Similarly cognitively, he is a moron compared to the person he used to be in terms of processing speed, problem-solving, raw intellectual horsepower Those things are going to decline even further Now, there is more nuance to this because there are certain things physically today that he thinks he actually does better than he did before In other words, you take advantage of the fact that as you’re getting less explosive, less powerful You can still maintain strength, and if you learn to move more intelligently, you can actually become more effective Similarly, as our intelligence transitions from a more fluid form when we’re young to a more crystallized experiential form when we’re older, we still have remarkable ability to contribute [Peter discussed fluid and crystallized intelligence with Arthur Brooks in episode #226] There’s no denying that on some of the prime levers against which you would evaluate these, we’re in a state of decline Conversely, the 3rd part of healthspan (which is emotional health), it actually doesn’t really tie to age much at all Depending on how you evaluate it, emotional health almost seems to have a U-shaped curve Not a really big obvious U, but a dip in, I think statistically, probably the late 40s, and then a gradual rising again One of the things that Peter always tries to remind himself and his patients is this is something we can really look forward to, provided we do the work: “I can be emotionally better off in a decade than I am today, and I am certainly better off today than I was a decade ago.” At the highest level, Peter describes longevity as a combination of lifespan and healthspan (comprised of physical, cognitive, and emotional health) If your definition of longevity is “I want to live to be 200,” Peter wouldn’t be able to help you “The way I think about it is longevity means how do we live longer? I think that means years longer, a decade longer. It doesn’t mean a doubling of lifespan. And how do we reduce the rate of decline of healthspan?”‒ Peter Attia Why healthspan is a crucial component of longevity [11:15] Why do you think it’s so important for someone to not only care about how long they live (the lifespan side), but also the healthspan side of how well they live? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Does pharmacological treatment for ADHD increase risk of cardiovascular disease?",
      "content": "One of the great challenges in medicine is in weighing the potential benefits of therapeutic strategies against their potential risks. In some cases, the decision may be fairly clear – chemotherapeutic drugs may wreak havoc on the body, but when the alternative is dying of cancer, most physicians and patients opt for treatment despite the side effects, at least when there is a clear survival advantage. But quite often, the risks and benefits are more nuanced or less certain, and the choice as to whether or not to proceed with a given therapy is far more complex. Indeed, one of the areas in which these decisions are perhaps most fraught is in the pharmacological treatment of certain psychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD, though commonly diagnosed during childhood and historically thought to resolve by adulthood, is now widely recognized as a lifelong disorder characterized by impulsivity, inattentiveness, hyperactivity, emotional dysregulation, and other symptoms of executive dysfunction. Currently estimated to affect 5-10% of US children and adults (though prevalence is on the rise), ADHD is typically treated with various stimulant (and to a lesser extent, non-stimulant) medications – which many patients take for decades following diagnosis. Thus, there is a clear need to understand the long-term health implications of these therapies – a need which motivated investigators Zhang et al. to conduct a recent case-control study on the association between ADHD medications and cardiovascular disease (CVD).1 What they did Zhang et al. conducted a nested case-control study using data from various Swedish national health registers. (In contrast to classical case-control studies, in nested case-control studies, cases and controls are all sampled from the same predefined source cohort of known size – in this case, individuals in the Swedish national health register.) All individuals aged 6 to 64 years in Sweden who received an incident diagnosis of ADHD or a dispensation for ADHD medication between 2007 and 2020 (n=278,027) were included, with cases defined as those who went on to develop CVD (including ischemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolic disease, arterial disease, and other forms of heart disease) in the follow-up period after their ADHD diagnosis. Each case was matched for age, sex, and calendar time (to ensure the same duration of follow-up) with up to five controls (i.e., individuals who did not develop CVD over the follow-up period). (Note that case-control studies often use control-to-case ratios greater than one in order to increase statistical power.) The date of incident ADHD diagnosis or ADHD medication dispensation (whichever came first) served as the baseline date for each participant, and the index date was defined as the date of CVD diagnosis (cases) or, for controls, the date of CVD diagnosis for the matched case. Individuals who had CVD at baseline or received ADHD medication for indications other than ADHD (e.g., narcolepsy, depression) were excluded, as were any individuals with a follow-up period of less than three months. Ultimately, this resulted in a final analysis cohort of 10,388 cases (median age at baseline: 34.6 years; 59.2% male) and 51,672 age- and sex-matched controls. What they found Median follow-up time was 4.1 years. The majority of both cases (83.9%) and controls (83.5%) were reported to have used ADHD medications during the follow-up period. The most commonly used medication was methylphenidate (a stimulant drug known by the trade names Ritalin, Concerta, and others), followed by atomexine (a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor often taken in combination with stimulant drugs, known by the trade name Strattera) and lisdexamfetamine (a stimulant composed of dextroamphetamine bound to L-lysine, known by the trade names Vyvanse and Elvanse). Of note, unbound dextroamphetamine (trade names Adderall, Dexedrine, and others) is one of the most commonly used medications for ADHD in the US but is not approved for this purpose in Europe; thus, this compound is not represented in this Sweden-based study. Across the full cohort, the incidence rate of any type of CVD was 7.34 per 1000 person-years, with the most common type being hypertension (4,210 cases; 40.5%), followed by arrhythmias (1,310 cases; 12.6%). After adjusting for covariates (country of birth, educational level, type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, sleep disorders, and psychiatric comorbidities), the authors reported a positive association between ADHD medication use and CVD risk, with longer durations of medication use associated with increasingly elevated risk up to 3-5 years of cumulative use, which corresponded to a 27% increase in risk relative to non-use (adjusted odds ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.17-1.39). Beyond five years of use, excess risk appeared to stabilize (Figure 1). Higher daily doses were also found to be associated with marginally higher (4-5%) CVD risk, but only at doses at least 1.5x higher than the average daily dose of 30 mg. Similar results were observed when examining females and males separately, whereas separate analyses of participants under 25 years of age versus 25 and over indicated that longer durations of medication use may impart greater elevations in CVD risk among children and adolescents than among adults (Figure 2).

Shaded areas represent 95% CIs for each group, with the gray shading indicating the area of overlap between the orange and blue. From Zhang et al. 2024. In sub-analyses for specific categories of CVD, Zhang et al. reported that use of ADHD medications for at least three years correlated with a significant increases in risk of hypertension (AOR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.51-1.97 for 3 to ≤5 years of use; AOR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.55-2.08 for >5 years) and in arterial disease (AOR: 1.65; 95% CI, 1.11-2.45 for 3 to ≤5 years; AOR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.96-2.32 for >5 years). (Note: arterial disease was defined as ICD-9 codes 440-444, which include atherosclerosis, aneurysms of the aorta or other vessels, aortic dissection, aortic embolism or thrombosis, or “other peripheral vascular disease” – a broad term, to say the least.) No statistically significant risk increases were observed for arrhythmias, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, thromboembolic disease, or cerebrovascular disease, or for hypertension or arterial disease following short-term (<3 years) use of medication. Sub-analyses by medication type revealed that long-term use of methylphenidate (e.g., Ritalin) was associated with an increased risk of CVD relative to no use (AOR: 1.20; 95%CI: 1.10-1.31 for 3 to ≤5 years; AOR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.08-1.31 for >5 years). Lisdexamfetamine was also associated with an elevated risk of CVD (AOR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05-1.44 for 2 to ≤3 years; AOR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.98-1.40 for >3 years). Atomoxetine use was associated with a significant increase in CVD risk only for the first year of use (AOR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.13). Discrepancies in baseline risk Based on these findings, the authors of this study conclude that long-term use of ADHD medications, particularly stimulant medications, are associated with increased CVD risk, specifically in the form of hypertension and arterial disease. But as with any case-control study, this conclusion depends critically on how well the groups are matched at baseline. Previous research has indicated that unmanaged ADHD is associated with higher rates of substance abuse, obesity, anxiety & stress disorders, sleep disorders, and other major risk factors for CVD.2–4 (Mechanistically, the idea that some or all of these associations represent causal relationships is highly likely.) Thus, in this study, both CVD cases and controls had ADHD diagnoses, and the exposure of interest was ADHD medication use, not presence/absence of ADHD. This is a critical strength of the study, and with this design, the results imply that use of ADHD medications is associated with an increase in CVD risk that exceeds any risk associated with unmanaged ADHD. However, despite cases and controls being matched for age, sex, and ADHD diagnosis, baseline characteristics reveal significant differences between the two groups, with cases exhibiting higher rates of comorbidities associated with CVD risk, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, sleep disorders, substance abuse, and anxiety/psychiatric disorders. For instance, the rate of substance use disorders among cases was over 30% higher among cases than among controls, while cases were also 60% more likely to have obesity and more than twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes. Zhang et al. adjusted for these specific covariates, but these discrepancies collectively imply that cases had poorer health overall than controls, which could easily extend to variables that were not included in adjustments, such as exercise habits and use of other medications. Further, binary adjustment for the presence versus absence of obesity, substance use, or other covariates doesn’t take into account that such variables exist on a spectrum – a BMI of 20 or a BMI of 29 would both be treated simply as an absence of obesity, despite the former falling within a healthy BMI range and the latter categorized as overweight. Any one of the discrepancies in comorbidity rates might be enough to call into question the study conclusions, but together, they follow a pattern strikingly similar to that mentioned above regarding unmanaged ADHD, which might suggest that cases suffered from more severe ADHD on average than controls. Pharmacological treatment has been shown to reduce the risk or severity of some – but not all – comorbidities associated with unmanaged ADHD.2 Thus, greater severity of ADHD (which would likely correlate with longer medication use) might be expected to increase risk of CVD independently of medication. The fact that individuals under age 25 evidently experience a greater elevation in risk with cumulative medication use than those over age 25 would agree with this alternative explanation, as the behavioral features of ADHD are more pronounced in more severe cases and are likely to result in diagnosis at an earlier age. (Indeed, the relative difference in comorbidity rates between cases and controls tended to be larger among those under 25 than among those 25 and older). Weighing cardiovascular risk against other benefits A question that this study was not designed to evaluate – but which nevertheless is central to this discussion – is how the potential elevation in cardiovascular risk weighs against the quality of life benefits that many ADHD patients derive from pharmacological treatments, as well as the reported benefits in mortality risk more broadly. The authors reported a significant increase in risk only in hypertension and arterial disease following at least three years of medication use, whereas no correlations were observed with short-term medication use or between long-term medication and other forms of CVD. Further, it’s worth noting that although “arterial disease” includes atherosclerosis and other serious heart conditions, it also includes common but relatively harmless conditions such as primary Raynaud’s syndrome,5 which is a well-documented side effect of stimulants used for ADHD6 and thus likely accounted for many if not most of the cases classified as “arterial disease.” In other words, it’s unclear to what extent the finding on arterial disease has real clinical relevance. Still, given the high population-wide prevalence of hypertension in most developed countries, the absolute increase in risk associated with ADHD medication is certainly substantial. As we’ve discussed in detail on The Drive, high blood pressure has devastating effects on long-term health, so for those who are already at high risk of hypertension or CVD, this added risk associated with ADHD medications may offset any potential benefits, particularly if ADHD is less severe and might be managed adequately with behavioral therapy as an alternative. Conversely, for those at low baseline risk of CVD, the additional risk of hypertension associated with ADHD medications may be a worthwhile tradeoff for the reported benefits – which range from improved social function and self-esteem to lower rates of driving accidents to fewer addictive behaviors (all of which may contribute to observations of shorter lifespan among those with untreated versus treated ADHD).7 The bottom line When evaluating the relative risks and benefits of any therapy, more information generally translates to better decisions. Thus, I applaud Zhang et al.’s attempt to add to the collective pool of data on ADHD medications by investigating their associations with cardiovascular health, but we must keep in mind that any single piece of information can be misleading if we fail to place it in a larger context. First, let’s be clear: the stimulant medications most commonly prescribed for ADHD management increase blood pressure, potentially to a level that meets clinical criteria for hypertension, which may in turn increase risk of other aspects of CVD. This was a well-documented side effect of these drugs long before this study. For individuals who do not have ADHD or other medical justification for these medications (e.g., narcolepsy), this blood pressure effect and other significant side effects absolutely translate to a net negative impact on health. Nothing in this study or this newsletter should be taken as an argument against the dangers of casual use of amphetamines (e.g., Adderall, Vyvanse) or methylphenidate (e.g., Ritalin) without medical need. However, this study was designed to answer whether or not, in the context of diagnosed ADHD, use of these medications raises CVD risk to an extent that exceeds the substantial CVD risk associated with unmanaged ADHD. Comparison of baseline characteristics between CVD cases and controls indicates that the former were at higher CVD risk at baseline and may also have experienced more severe ADHD than controls, undermining reported associations with CVD and potentially suggesting that regardless of pharmacological management, more severe ADHD might be associated with a higher CVD risk than more mild cases. But even if we accept that ADHD medications increase risk of hypertension (based on prior work in addition to this current study), this finding still cannot be taken in isolation as evidence that use of these drugs should be abandoned by all. ADHD itself comes with substantial risks to physical and emotional health, many of which can be mitigated effectively by pharmacological treatment. Risks associated with any drug, supplement, or intervention must be weighed against benefits, and the balance is likely to depend on the individual in question. In light of the rising prevalence of ADHD diagnoses and medication use, more work is needed in order to understand more fully the long-term health implications of the use of various ADHD medications – and how they compare to the considerable long-term implications of unmanaged ADHD. *** For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama *** References Zhang L, Li L, Andell P, et al.

Peter has written about this trial We’re not going to go into great detail with respect to its primary outcome of ASCVD The short answer is it did not increase the risk of ASCVD Peter and Ted found themselves discussing a question of prostate cancer Tell folks a little bit about what we did and didn’t learn with respect to prostate cancer from the TRAVERSE study This study looked at men who were hypogonadal, who presented with some degree of symptoms, and then the idea was to replete their testosterone, bring it up to a eugonadal level The bump that they had in the TRAVERSE was pretty small, 140 ng/mL, so a tiny bump with bearing in mind about a 60%+ dropout rate at 5 years Very few people were actually maintaining the protocols that they originally set out to do at the beginning of the study With that in mind, the idea was: does supplementation of someone’s endogenous testosterone with exogenous testosterone increase one’s risk for being diagnosed with prostate cancer, with the implication that this could address 2 potential concerns 1 – Exogenous T would fuel the progression of an pre-existing prostate cancer 2 – And/or exogenous T would induce a cancer de novo in somebody with a low T state when you bring them into a higher testosterone state There is a lot of detail about who was enrolled in the study Everybody was hypogonadal and the mean PSA for individuals in TRAVERSE in both arms was around 0.9 ng/mL So this is a low risk group of men because we know PSA is the main way that we screen for prostate cancer In general, the higher one’s PSA, the higher one’s risk would be of being diagnosed with prostate cancer On average, these are men in their 60s with low testosterone and low PSAs on average ‒ they are a low risk group, and you take them from a hypogonadal to barely eugonadal state Ted explains, “The bottom line for the trial in a secondary analysis pre-specified, was that there were no more prostate cancers diagnosed in men on T replacement versus on placebo.” The total number of prostate cancers in TRAVERSE that were detected was very low In a cohort of 5,300+ men, there were 23 total cases of prostate cancer in the TRAVERSE study [12 in the testosterone group and 11 in the placebo group, see the figure below] The features of the individuals who had prostate cancer in TRAVERSE were on average higher PSAs than the median Again, the median PSA on entry was around 0.9 Individuals who were diagnosed with prostate cancer had higher median PSAs and had higher shifts in their PSA while in the TRAVERSE trial than those men that did not develop or were not diagnosed with prostate cancer Figure 1. Incidence of prostate cancer in the TRAVERSE trial. Image credit: NEJM 2023 What this study tells us about prostate cancer risk is reassuring in many ways 1 – Men with low PSAs have a low risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer 2 – You can use PSA in generally similar fashions when you’re supplementing a man on exogenous testosterone That is, you can look at changes in the PSA For most men in TRAVERSE, their PSA did not change It changed less than half a point over the course of the trial And for those individuals whose PSA did go up, those were the men that were at risk for or were subsequently at higher risk for being identified as having or harboring a prostate cancer There was a figure in the paper that showed the non-statistical significance in the difference between the incidence of prostate cancer in the groups. Even though it never comes close to reaching statistical significance (because in large part the sample size is so low), and even if there was a difference, it would be very hard to see The incidence curves do diverge a little bit Figure 2. Estimated cumulative indices of prostate cancer in the TRAVERSE trial. Image credit: JAMA 2023 The study wasn’t long enough or wasn’t large enough to see if this was increasing the incidence or recognition of prostate cancer [the mean duration of follow-up was 33 months] What are your thoughts on that line of inquiry? This is a large cohort [5246 men] Ted felt like there is pretty limited data to suggest that levels of testosterone or supplementation of testosterone really are strong and correlated with the induction of or the precipitation of a preexisting prostate cancer He personally felt that supplementation of individuals in a hypogonadal state to a eugonadal state is not going to increase their risk for the induction of or the propagation of a pre-existing prostate cancer In this study, you’re bringing somebody from a state where they have low T to a more eugonadal state, and there’s some interesting work that helps us understand what happens when a prostate grows One of the main growth components for a prostate are androgens, either in the form of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (which has a much higher affinity for the androgen receptor) And this really does 2 things: 1 – It causes growth and differentiation 2 – The sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to these growth hormones (for them androgens or DHT) is different between a cancerous and a non-cancerous cell There’s actually much higher densities of androgen receptor within a benign prostatic cell, and therefore they’re much more sensitive to supplementation of testosterone With that in mind, most of the studies that have looked at supplementation of testosterone in eugonadal men have shown more often than not, that they actually have worsening of their BPH or urinary symptoms And that’s thought to be due to the greater sensitivity of benign cells to exogenous T than actually the development or progression of a prostate cancer So that’s TRAVERSE plus a couple of other smaller but consistent studies that have been published over the last 2-3 decades within the urology space {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Don’t underestimate the importance of oral health",
      "content": "Oral hygiene is a necessary but Sisyphean task. As soon as you finish brushing your teeth, the oral microbiome begins to repopulate and reform biofilms, a process that is kept in check with a twice-daily routine. But this constant battle against bacteria may have profound impacts for health well beyond the teeth and gums. Certain circumstances can, at times, prevent some individuals from brushing their teeth. As an extreme example, someone in the ICU on a ventilator would not be able to brush their own teeth for days or potentially weeks. Such cases presented the authors of a recent meta-analysis with an opportunity to investigate whether the introduction of toothbrushing interventions might correspond to better health among ICU patients.¹ In particular, they focused their attention on incidence rates of hospital-acquired infections, as ICU patients are known to be at increased risk of acquiring infections like pneumonia. While the vast majority of us hopefully will not find ourselves on ventilators in the ICU in the near future, this study is illustrative of how the mundane habits of brushing (and flossing) are important for the overall health of every individual. Hospital-acquired infections One of the most common hospital-acquired infections is hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), a severe, sometimes fatal, lung infection that affects about 300,000 people in the U.S. each year. Although anyone admitted to the hospital for 48 hours or more can get pneumonia, the highest incidence is reported in the ICU, where anywhere from 12-29% of patients contract HAP, of which 90% is ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). All-cause mortality associated with VAP is estimated to be between 20-50%. The lower end of this range (~20%) may underestimate true VAP mortality, since another 60% are released to long-term care facilities, including hospice.2,3 Analyses of the bacteria in the mouth and lungs of patients with VAP support the hypothesis that one of the causes of VAP (and perhaps of other types of HAP as well) is the aspiration of small amounts of oral bacteria.4 The most critically ill patients aren’t likely to be able to brush their teeth, which allows an overgrowth of bacteria, and any impairment in swallowing (i.e., from a ventilator) means a greater chance of inhaling small amounts of bacteria-containing saliva. Therefore, this recent meta-analysis pooled fifteen studies to evaluate HAP incidence with a toothbrushing intervention, a known strategy to break up oral biofilms and reduce oral bacterial load. What did the study find? The pooled analysis included a total of 2,786 subjects, mostly in an ICU setting, with patients who had either oral or nasal intubation. Since the most common form of oral care for patients receiving mechanical ventilation is mouthwash treatment with the antiseptic chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine was used in both the toothbrushing and control groups in eleven of the fifteen studies. The remaining four studies used either plaque-removing toothpaste, saline, povidone-iodine (another antiseptic), or purified water for both groups. Although chlorhexidine and other antiseptics can help control the growth of bacteria, randomized trials to date have not been able to demonstrate a decrease in VAP from this type of care. In contrast, this present study reported that subjects randomized to a toothbrushing intervention had significant, 33% lower HAP risk (RR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.56-0.81) than controls, and this was driven by a reduction in VAP rates (RR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.57-0.82). It has been proposed that mechanical scrubbing via toothbrushing is more effective at disrupting plaque than an antiseptic rinse alone. The relative 32% reduction in the incidence of VAP translates to one fewer VAP case for every 12 patients receiving toothbrushing treatments. Even by a low estimation of 20% VAP mortality, this would reduce VAP mortality to 13.6%, resulting in about 17,000 fewer deaths each year. Non-ventilator HAP trended towards favoring a toothbrushing intervention but did not reach statistical significance, since there were five total cases of HAP across both the experimental and control groups in only two of the 15 studies. Of note, subanalyses showed no additional benefit of toothbrushing more than twice per day. So an intervention of twice-per-day toothbrushing by non-dental nursing staff was deemed sufficient to maximize reductions in the incidence of VAP. Additional benefits of toothbrushing A reduced risk of severe infection would be a sufficient outcome on its own, but other benefits were also observed in the toothbrushing intervention groups. Toothbrushing was associated with extubation 1.24 days sooner (95% CI: -2.42 to -0.06 days) and a 1.78-day shorter ICU stay (95% CI: -2.85 to -0.70 days). Toothbrushing was also associated with a 19% reduction in ICU mortality (RR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.69-0.95), but this effect did not remain significant in the sensitivity analysis of the four low-bias studies reporting this outcome. Unlike the relationship between oral bacteria and VAP, there may not be an obvious direct link between toothbrushing and ICU stay or mortality, but it nevertheless suggests that oral health impacts systemic health. Oral hygiene is important for everyone Mounting evidence indicates that oral health is connected to other chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While HAP or VAP might not be concerning for most individuals, general poor oral health eventually leads to chronic periodontal disease (i.e., advanced gum disease), the most prevalent chronic infection, which affects 46% of adults in the US. Periodontal disease is associated with a 3.5-fold increase in the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and a 1.7-fold increase in the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.5,6 This could be because these diseases share common pathways (e.g., inflammation), but the gram-negative bacteria found in periodontitis are also known to penetrate the vascular endothelium and cause endothelial dysfunction. These bacteria have been found at distant sites in the body including aortic plaques and some brains of AD patients, suggesting that the presence of dental diseases could at the very least fuel the progression of other chronic diseases, even if it does not initiate them.7 A routine of toothbrushing twice per day and flossing daily, along with regular visits to the dentist for professional cleaning, is the best way to prevent the build-up of bacteria-containing plaques and tartar. Given the accessibility of preventative habits with limited adverse outcomes, oral health should be a priority, whether dental diseases are associated with – or causal of – other diseases. Limitations of this study Although oral health habits are important for everyone regardless of whether or not they are in the hospital, there are several limitations to the trials included in this analysis. Conducting a double-blind trial for this type of intervention is impossible, as the staff will know which intervention is performed on each patient. This means there is a possible bias in the care by the nursing staff, such as extra vigilance for aspiration or better overall care of patients receiving the intervention. Many of these studies blinded the authors who performed the analysis instead to minimize the introduction of bias. Another source of bias is that the included studies were heterogeneous for the country, nursing protocols, and adjunct measures. It is possible that toothbrushing reduced VAP despite these differences, but it cannot be ruled out that another form of care may have contributed to the apparent reduction in VAP incidence. Most of the included studies compared toothbrushing with antiseptic mouthwash to mouthwash alone, but none added flossing as an additional part of the regimen. Flossing is arguably just as important as brushing, and so it is possible that there could be an even greater impact of oral hygiene on the morbidity and mortality from VAP if both toothbrushing and flossing had been included in the interventions. The bottom line For critically ill, hospitalized patients, a relatively simple intervention of toothbrushing reduced the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Toothbrushing also had broader implications for recovery, reducing overall time of ventilation and ICU stay, demonstrating that at minimum, oral health is a barometer for overall health, and in all likelihood, has systemic effects. Although broader implications of oral health in chronic disease are not fully understood, even the possibility of poor oral health contributing to chronic disease should be a motivation for everyone to maintain an oral hygiene routine, particularly given the minimal downsides. At the very least, doing so will certainly help to prevent gum disease, and at best, it might have meaningful, positive impacts on whole-body health. A further reminder that a little prevention can go a long way. For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama References Ehrenzeller S, Klompas M.

Your path through medical school and training was not very typical Zak grew up in Switzerland Nobody in his family was a doctor He came to the US, decided to major in biology, and then got nerd sniped by computing in the late 70s, so he minored in computer science He goes to medical school, and in the middle of the first year he realized it was not what he expected It’s a noble profession, but it’s not a science (it’s an art) He thought he was going into science He bails out for a while to do a PhD in computer science This is in the early 80s, and it’s a heyday of AI (actually a 2nd heyday) We’re currently in the 3rd heyday It was a time of great promise With retrospective scope, it’s very clear that it was not going to be successful But unlike today, we had not released it to the public It was not actually working in the way that we thought it was going to work, and it certainly didn’t scale His thesis advisor at MIT (Peter Szolovits) said, “Zak, you should finish your clinical training because I’m not getting a lot of respect from clinicians. And so, to bring rational decision making to the clinic, you really want to finish your clinical training.” Zak finished medical school, did a residency in pediatrics and then pediatric endocrinology, which was actually extremely enjoyable When he was done, he restarted his research in computing He started a lab at Children’s Hospital in Boston and then a center of biomedical informatics at the medical school Zak was getting a lot of grants, and like almost every other endeavor, getting money gets attention from the powers that be They asked him to start a center and then eventually a new department of biomedical informatics that he’s the chair of They now have 16 professors or assistant professors of biomedical informatics Zak has been involved in a lot of machine learning projects Like everybody else, Zak was taken by surprise by large language models He got an email from Peter Lee in October ‘22 (it was right out of a Michael Crichton novel), that said, “Zak, if you’ll answer the phone, I can’t tell you what it’s about, but it’ll be well worth your while.” Peter was a Professor of Computer Science at CMU and also department chair there Then, he went to DARPA and then he went to Microsoft He told Zak about GPT-4, and this was before any of us had heard about ChatGPT (which is initially GPT-3.5) He gets Zak early access to it when no one else knows that it exists, and Zak starts trying it against hard cases Zak remembers from his training, being called down to the nursery There’s a child with a small phallus and a hole at the base of the phallus, and they can’t palpate testicles They want to know what to do because Zak is a pediatric endocrinologist So Zak asked GPT-4 about this case, “What would you do? What are you thinking about?” It runs him through the whole workup of these very rare cases of ambiguous genitalia In this case, it was congenital adrenal hyperplasia where the making of excess androgens during pregnancy and then subsequently birth causes the clitoris to swell, form the glans of the penis, of the phallus, and the labia minora to fuse to form the shaft of what looks like a penis But there’s no testicles, there’s ovaries There’s a whole endocrine workup with genetic tests, hormonal tests, ultrasound, and it does it all Zak explains, “It really blows my mind, because very few of us in computer science really thought that these large language models would scale up the way they do. It was just not expected.” Talking to Bill Gates about this, he told me that his line engineers in Microsoft Research, a lot of his fanciest computer scientists did not expect this But the line engineers at Microsoft were just watching the scale-up, GPT-0, 1, 2, and they just saw it was going to keep on scaling up with the size of the data and with the size of the model And they said, “Yeah, of course this is going to achieve this kind of expertise.” “But the rest of us, I think because we value our own intellects so much, we couldn’t imagine how we would get that kind of conversational expertise just by scaling up the model and the data set.”‒ Zak Kohane The evolution of AI from the earliest versions to today’s neural networks, and the shifting definitions of intelligence over time [8:00] Zak alluded to the fact that when he was doing his PhD in the early ‘80s, he was in the 2nd generation of AI This leads Peter to assume that the 1st generation was shortly following World War II Alan Turing and the Turing test Talk us through what Alan Turing posited, what the Turing test was and proposed to be, and really what the 1st generation of AI was After World War II, we had computing machines, and anybody who was a serious computer scientist could see that you could have these processes that could generate other processes {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "My recent lesson in overtraining – and in the power of seeing first-hand the impacts of positive health changes",
      "content": "Most of us – even physicians – have a couple of vices when it comes to optimizing our own health and performance, even when we know the potential harm. Whether it be a couple of happy hour drinks most days, skimping on sleep during the workweek, or not drinking enough water, we often know what we should do, but for whatever reason, we ignore that knowledge. The vice of overtraining No one reading this will be surprised to know that I love working out, or that, as a result, one of my personal vices is overtraining. I know, I know – that probably sounds as stilted and pretentious as a job candidate who responds to an interviewer by saying “my biggest professional weakness is that I’m too committed to my work” – but as I explained in a recent premium article on VO2 max, overtraining is indeed well known to paradoxically impair physical performance. On a whole-body scale, overtraining can even lead to poor sleep, low mood, and a variety of other symptoms. I know this. I’ve seen it in some of my own patients. But call it stubbornness, habit, or whatever you will, I’ve nevertheless persisted in my exercise routine. That is, until I was recently forced to skip some workouts due to a hectic travel schedule – and was stunned by what I saw when I got back to my old routine, as I explain in the video below. <iframe title=\"My recent lesson in overtraining\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/71qyGc6I9kw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> After a break from upper body workouts for one week, I hit personal records in not one, not two, but every exercise in my next upper body session. It felt fantastic, and the only plausible explanation for the improvement was the break from training. The magnitude of difference it made left me downright flabbergasted, even though I’d known on an intellectual level that overtraining can negatively impact performance and that my own training regimen put me at risk of this very effect. Seeing is believing For some who are reading this, awareness of overtraining and its effects on performance might be the most important takeaway. But overtraining is just one – and far from the most common – of countless potential health-related vices. In some cases, skipping too many workouts is a concern, while for others, it might be snacking too close to bedtime, or not making enough time for loved ones, or not eating enough fiber. Regardless of the behavior, sometimes knowing what’s best for our health isn’t enough to motivate us to make positive changes. In my case, I had to experience the result of the change before I could truly appreciate it and make the decision to rethink my training regimen going forward. Seeing was believing – and I might never have made it there without a short (and, as I thought at the time, undesirable) disruption of my usual workout plan. Likewise, those with other negative health habits might find that even brief (or in my case, accidental) experimentation with giving them up might generate eye-opening results that make it easier to commit to long-term changes. And while not all changes will lead to immediate, perceptible improvements, at the very least, you just might find that abandoning known, long-held vices is easier than you thought.

      "content": "The onset of type II diabetes (T2D) is slow and often asymptomatic until it has reached an advanced stage, by which point years of damage have likely already been done. Rather than wait for the onset of symptoms, T2D can be detected at earlier stages using metrics related to the disease’s most damaging characteristic, the impairment of glycemic control. Specifically, current clinical diagnostics rely on measurements of fasting plasma glucose, plasma glucose levels in response to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and, most recently, hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c (and by “most recently” I mean over the past fifteen years). But while these tests are the most commonly used, are they all equally sufficient for detecting early stages of metabolic disease? Where does each succeed, and where does each fall short?

      "content": "Early detection of dementia with fMRI Why we are interested: The incidence of dementia is on the rise, with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) being the most common cause. Early detection of brain changes associated with dementia would provide the opportunity for early interventions to slow or disrupt the disease process. Previous work has indicated that changes in functional connectivity between certain brain regions are apparent via MRI in high-risk populations relative to healthy populations, even before the onset of cognitive symptoms. However, prior to this study, it wasn’t clear whether these changes could be used at the level of the individual to predict future dementia risk. What this study showed: This nested case-control study employed functional MRI scans during a resting state (rs-fMRI) along with computer modeling to map effective connectivity in 103 dementia cases (22 individuals with prevalent dementia and 81 who later developed dementia over the 9-year follow-up) and 1,030 matched controls. The researchers focused their investigations on the brain’s default-mode network (DMN), a network of brain areas thought to be particularly susceptible to AD pathology, and identified 15 connectivity parameters which could be used to predict future dementia. Use of effective connectivity maps in the DMN was found to be superior to other prognostication models (e.g., volumes of brain regions associated with AD, cognitive scores) in predicting future dementia incidence, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) of 0.82, indicating performance well above chance (which would correspond to an AUROC of 0.5). This work suggests that using rs-fMRI to determine effective connectivity could become a tool for identifying signatures of dementia risk early in the course of disease, prior to cognitive symptoms. doi: 10.1038/s44220-024-00259-5 Enzymes from gut bacteria used to generate ABO-universal blood Why we are interested: Blood transfusions save millions of lives every year, but matching the ABO blood groups of donor red blood cells (RBCs) and recipients is critical to avoid a systemic immune response by the recipient against the donor blood. ABO blood groups differ on the antigens found on their exterior, and the recipient immune system recognizes and attacks RBCs with foreign antigens. Blood types A and B have additional antigens in comparison to type O, which, because of the absence of these other antigens, can therefore be used universally in a medical emergency when a patient’s blood type is unknown. What this study showed: Enzymes can be used to convert group A and/or group B RBCs to the ABO-universal group O blood type by degrading the additional antigens. This type of enzymatically processed blood is called ECO blood. Early trials of enzymatic production of ECO blood had problems with unexplained reactions with recipient plasma, now thought to be caused by extended antigens that were not degraded in this initial process. This study reports the discovery of enzymes sourced from bacteria found in the human gut, Akkermansia muciniphila, to remove the extended antigens found on type A and type B RBCs. This strain of bacteria exclusively degrades intestinal mucins, a family of heavily glycosylated proteins, as energy sources, and since intestinal mucins have the same ABO antigens on their surfaces, enzymes found within Akkermansia would likely be able to degrade antigens found on the surface of RBCs – a hypothesis put to the test by this study. As discussed in my discussion with Colleen Cutcliffe in episode #283, Akkermansia is notoriously difficult to culture, as it requires an anaerobic environment. However, once the enzymes were extracted and purified, the conversion of type A and type B RBCs to type O was performed in 30 minutes at room temperature, conditions that suggest clinical feasibility. The enzymes were removed post-treatment to avoid any adverse carryover effects. The degradation of A, B, and extended antigens greatly reduced the number of incompatible O plasmas, although more optimization is required to reduce incompatibilities further. This work offers a way forward for the production of ABO-universal blood, a potential solution during blood shortages. doi: 10.1038/s41564-024-01663-4 An immunotherapy target to reduce T cell exhaustion in cancer Why we are interested: As detailed in past podcast episodes, the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has constituted a major advance in immunotherapy treatment of many cancers. Cancer cells often evade destruction by the body’s immune system by activating immune checkpoints which inhibit T cell responses. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block these inhibitory signals, thus allowing T cells to kill tumor cells. However, chronic T cell activation can lead to a physiologic state called “T cell exhaustion,” in which T cells are no longer able to kill cancer cells. Enhancing the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitor therapy therefore depends on gaining a better understanding of the processes that control T cell exhaustion. What this study showed: This study characterized a connection between the sympathetic stress response, tissue innervation, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Catecholamines (noradrenaline and adrenaline, also called norepinephrine and epinephrine) are released by the activation of sympathetic (i.e., “fight or flight”) nerves and activate β-adrenergic receptors, such as ADRB1. Not surprisingly, the chronic stress of malignant disease is associated with increased levels of catecholamines. The authors showed that terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells exhibit increased expression of ADRB1, and in some disease models, these T cells were positioned closer to sympathetic nerves than their non-exhausted counterparts. However, the deletion of Adrb1 (the gene encoding the ADRB1 receptor) promoted the maintenance of progenitor T cells (stem-like T cells) and impaired migration toward sympathetic nerves. Similarly, the use of β-blockers selective for ADRB1 promoted T cell effector function and reduced T cell exhaustion. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) showed high expression of Adrb1 in mouse models of colon cancer and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-responsive melanoma. Blockade of ADRB1 signaling in combination with ICB provided synergistic benefits, and the investigators observed smaller tumors and increased cytokine production by CD8+ T cells. In other words, blockade of ADRB1 improved T cells’ ability to fight cancer cells, as predicted by the mechanistic experiments demonstrating reduced T cell exhaustion. This study proposes that ADRB1 is a new immune checkpoint that is expressed by exhausted T cells. The adrenergic signaling via ADRB1 of a chronic stress response contributes to the terminal differentiation of exhausted T cells. Targeting adrenergic receptors in combination with ICB may be effective in promoting anti-tumor T cell responses and reducing T cell exhaustion. doi: 10.1038/s41586-023-06568-6 Intragastric expandable oral capsules for weight loss, phase 3 trial Why we are interested: Obesity remains a major global health concern and raises one’s risk of many chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The development of novel, effective treatment options has the potential to improve the quality and length of countless lives, as well as to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity and the physiological mechanisms underlying appetite and satiation. What the study showed: This phase 3, double-blind randomized trial was based on the premise that satiety can be induced if a substantial volume of the stomach is full, regardless of whether the fullness results from caloric food or a non-caloric substance. Participants with BMIs between 24-40 kg/m2 across six Chinese hospitals were randomized to treatment with either placebo capsules (n=137) or expandable oral capsules (carboxymethylcellulose cross-linked with citric acid) which absorb water, forming a gel that expands to occupy approximately one-quarter of the stomach volume (n=140). Four capsules were taken with water every day before lunch and dinner for 24 weeks, and at the end of the trial, mean weight change among all participants randomized to the expandable capsules was –4.9%±5.4% and –1.9%±4.5% among those randomized to placebo (P<0.001). When analysis was restricted to those who completed the full treatment protocol, mean body weight change at week 24 was –6.1%±5.4% for the expandable capsule group (n=111) and −2.5%±4.5% for the placebo group (n=103), again demonstrating superior weight loss among the treatment group. Mild gastrointestinal discomfort was the most common adverse event reported in both groups and did not differ significantly between treatments (25% in the expandable capsule group versus 21.9% in the placebo group). The gel used in this study is pH-sensitive, which enables it to degrade in the colon where the released water is reabsorbed and the hydrogel is expelled in feces. Of note, this gel is similar to the FDA-approved hydrogel Plenity, which has also been shown in a six-month trial to improve weight loss relative to placebo. doi: 10.1111/dom.15418 For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama",

      "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter delves into two topics that have generated a lot of questions over the years: skin cancer and sunscreen. He begins by exploring the basics of UV radiation, discussing its effects on vitamin D conversion, photoaging, and its role in skin cancer. He examines various skin types, discussing their implications for sun exposure and vitamin D levels, as well as how to determine where you fall on the skin type scale. He then delves into the various types of skin cancer, with a particular emphasis on melanoma, exploring its complex relationship with UV exposure and other contributing risk factors. Additionally, he covers tanning beds, the importance of early skin cancer detection through regular skin checks, and the often confusing topic of sunscreen. He explains how sunscreen affects UV radiation and skin cancer risk, what SPF levels to choose, the differences between organic and mineral sunscreens, and what to consider when selecting the best sunscreen for your needs.

And the three main impacts of UV radiation: 1) Vitamin D Conversion: How UV light facilitates the production of vitamin D in the skin. 2) Photoaging: The effect of ultraviolet light on skin aging. 3) Role in Skin Cancer: How UV radiation contributes to the development of different skin cancers Understanding solar UV: from the electromagnetic spectrum to skin health [3:45] When we say solar UV, what are we referring to? Figure 1. Sources: NPR. Power Electronic Tips, Office of the Surgeon General (US); 2014 Electromagnetic Spectrum Overview: What is happening when wavelengths across an electromagnetic spectrum change in size? Different types of waves explained: Sound Waves: Longer wavelengths can bend around corners, making them audible even when the source is not in direct sight. Light Waves: Shorter wavelengths are visible to the human eye but cannot bend around corners like sound waves. Visible Light Spectrum The visible spectrum of light ranges from 400 to 700 nanometers. This range represents only a small part of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, including everything from red light to blue light. Ultraviolet Light Ultraviolet light exists from about 100 to 400 nanometers, just below the visible light spectrum. More about ultraviolet light—it is divided into three types: UVA: 315 to 400 nanometers. UVB: 280 to 315 nanometers. UVC: 100 to 280 nanometers. Characteristics of Ultraviolet Light Shorter wavelengths contain more energy. Common misconceptions about microwaves: Microwaves have longer wavelengths than visible light. Visible light is more energetic than microwaves, so standing next to a microwave is not more dangerous than exposure to visible light. Ultraviolet A, B, and C UVA: Longest wavelength, lower energy, penetrates deeper into the skin, contributing to aging and long-term skin damage. UVB: Shorter wavelength, higher energy, responsible for sunburn and crucial for vitamin D conversion in the skin. UVC: Shortest wavelength, highest energy, but does not reach Earth’s surface due to atmospheric absorption, so it is not a concern for skin exposure. Relevance of UVA and UVB: UVA and UVB are the primary types of UV radiation that reach Earth’s surface. UVA: Broader band (315 to 400 nanometers). Accounts for 95% of UV radiation exposure. Penetrates deeper into the skin but is less ionizing. UVB: Narrower band (280 to 315 nanometers). Accounts for 5% of UV radiation exposure. Higher energy, causes sunburn, and aids in vitamin D conversion. Conclusion of UV Radiation Explanation UV light, visible light, and other forms of energy differ significantly. UVA and UVB have specific impacts on skin health, with UVA penetrating deeper and contributing to aging, while UVB causes sunburn and helps in vitamin D synthesis.

      "title": "Does hormone replacement therapy impact dementia risk?",
      "content": "Dementia is one of the most significant causes of disability and mortality worldwide, with over 55 million individuals currently estimated to suffer from the condition.¹ The medical community has long recognized that women are at substantially higher risk of developing dementia than men – a discrepancy that persists even after accounting for longer average lifespan among women relative to men in developed countries. This observation suggests that estrogen or other sex hormones may play an important role in cognitive decline, an idea which led researchers Pourhadi et al. to conduct a recent study on whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) – i.e., therapy designed to offset the drop in estrogen levels that occurs during menopause – might be associated with increased risk of dementia later in life.² What they did In light of hints from previous observational data suggesting a possible link between hormone therapy and dementia, Pourhadi et al. conducted a case-control study comparing HRT use among women with incident dementia (cases, n=5,589) and age-matched dementia-free women (controls, n=55,890). Cases and controls were identified from across the female Danish population between 2000-2018 using Danish national registries. All participants were between the ages of 50 and 60 as of January 1, 2000, and all were free of any history of dementia, breast or gynecological cancers, blood clots or clotting disorders, liver disease, bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries), or hysterectomy. The primary exposure of interest was the use of combined estrogen and progestin (E+P) for menopausal hormone replacement therapy. Using data from the Danish National Prescription Registry, the investigators assessed participants’ HRT use from January 1, 1995 until two years prior to the index date (for cases, this was the date of either dementia diagnosis or start of dementia treatment, while for controls, this was the date at which their age-matched case received a dementia diagnosis or initiated dementia treatment). What they found Of the 5,589 dementia cases, 4,436 (79.4%) were late-onset all-cause dementia, while 1,458 (26.1%) cases were registered as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The results showed that a total of 1,782 (31.9%) cases and 16,154 (28.9%) controls had received combined E+P menopausal hormone therapy before the index date. Most of these individuals (66.2%, or 11,879) had ceased E+P use >8 years before the index date, while 1,555 (8.7%) were still users at the time of the index date. Compared with never-users of menopausal E+P therapy and estrogen-only or progestin-only users, ever-users of menopausal E+P treatment were reportedly 24% more likely to develop all-cause dementia after adjusting for various confounders (adjusted HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.17-1.33). In looking at subtypes of dementia, the authors reported that ever-users of menopausal E+P treatment were also 21% more likely than controls to develop late-onset dementia (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.12-1.30) and 22% more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) specifically (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.07-1.39). Moreover, longer durations of hormone use were associated with further increases in dementia risk. While use of E+P for less than one year was associated with a 21% increase in risk of all-cause dementia relative to never-users (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.09-1.35), women who used these hormones for 8-12 years were at a 39% higher risk than never-users (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.58). Risk elevation among women on E+P for over 12 years was stronger still – an increase of 74% over never-users (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.45-2.10). A similar pattern held for late-onset dementia, though not for AD-related dementia. Collectively, these results indicate that women who use menopausal hormone therapy are at higher risk of dementia than those who do not use HRT, and that longer periods of use are associated with further increases in risk. Reasons for doubt So, how do these findings impact my generally positive views on menopausal HRT? Not at all, as this retrospective study suffers from a number of flaws (some of which are pointed out by the authors themselves) which ultimately prevent drawing any clinically meaningful conclusions from these results. As is common in observational studies, confounding variables may certainly have played a hand in these results. Cases were significantly more likely than controls to live alone, have lower education levels and household income, and have hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disease, all of which are known risk factors for dementia. The authors adjusted for these factors in their statistical analyses, but they are likely mere examples of many distinctions between the two groups. Based on these reported differences alone, we can infer that controls likely had better overall health and were engaging in more health-conscious behaviors which would independently reduce their risk of dementia, such as exercising or maintaining lower lipid levels. These possible confounds likely explain why even women with hardly any HRT exposure (i.e., those on HRT for less than one year) were still found to have significantly elevated dementia risk. (Indeed, risk among women taking E+P for <1 year was higher than among women taking E+P for 1-4 years or 4-8 years.) Further, we have reason to doubt the accuracy of certain elements of Poudhari et al.’s source data. For instance, data on hormone therapy use, duration, formulation, and dosage was based on filled prescriptions, but prescriptions filled are not necessarily prescriptions taken, potentially introducing error into the subsequent analyses. Additionally, we cannot trust the data on AD diagnoses since AD cases were almost certainly vastly underreported in this cohort. While AD is estimated to account for 60-80% of all dementia cases worldwide, in this study, it nominally accounted for only 26% – a discrepancy which the authors themselves point out as reflecting incomplete information on dementia diagnoses in health registries. In effect, this shortcoming renders any reported associations between HRT and Alzheimer’s disease completely meaningless. But perhaps the greatest limitation of this study with regard to its clinical relevance is that the hormone formulations used by women in this study do not reflect the formulations most commonly used for HRT in the present day. The authors report that the primary progestin used by women in this study was norethisterone (83.5% of cases on E+P and 80.6% of controls), followed by medroxyprogesterone and levonorgestrel, with ~90% of women in both groups using oral formulations. As I’ve discussed previously, use of these synthetic progestins has fallen dramatically over the years, and bioidentical micronized progesterone is now overwhelmingly preferred as a source of systemic progesterone in HRT. Indeed, systemic progesterone in general is less common with HRT than it was two decades ago, as progesterone-coated intrauterine devices are gaining increasing favor. In other words, even if we assume Poudhari et al.’s results are accurate and haven’t been influenced significantly by confounding or source data inaccuracies, they have little bearing on the question of cognitive health implications of HRT in a modern setting. The bottom line Through this case-control study, authors Pourhadi et al. attempted to determine how combined estrogen and progestin therapy in menopausal women impacted risk of dementia. Though the investigators reported higher risk of all-cause, late-onset, and Alzheimer’s-associated dementia with hormone use, these results were likely heavily confounded, preventing us from making any real conclusions that hormone therapy underlies the apparent association. Even if such an association were to exist, the formulations used by most women in this study are not representative of formulations more commonly used today, so these results tell us nothing about a potential link between HRT and dementia in the present day. As I’ve discussed at length on the podcast, far too many women have been denied the benefits of HRT over the years as a result of heavily flawed reports of associations with disease, and I sincerely hope that the results by Poudhari et al. do not add further fuel to the anti-HRT fire. As exemplified by this study, fears over HRT use are largely founded in misleading correlations with dubious relevance to modern clinical practice, whereas the many benefits of HRT for menopausal women remain clear and robust.

      "content": "In this special episode, Peter addresses the common questions about starting or returning to an exercise routine over the age of 50. Individuals in this age group have frequently reached out with questions about whether it’s too late to start exercising and often express concern over a lack of prior training, a fear of injury, or uncertainty about where to begin. Peter delves into the importance of fitness for older adults, examining all four pillars of exercise, and provides practical advice on how to start exercising safely, minimize injury risk, and maximize potential benefits. Although this conversation focuses on people in the “older” age category, it also applies to anyone of any age who is deconditioned and looking to ease into regular exercise.

It addresses common questions from people aged 50+ about starting exercise. Aimed at those who haven’t trained before, worry about injuries, or think it’s too late to make a difference. Although the focus is on people aged 50+, the advice applies to anyone deconditioned and looking to start exercising. Younger listeners can share this episode with their older parents to encourage them to start exercising. This conversation is intended to mimic how Peter would speak to his patients. Key Points on starting exercise as an older adult: Peter is himself in the over 50 camp And 50 is a significant turning point for starting exercise, but another crucial point is 65+. At 65+, people typically experience noticeable reductions in strength and vestibular changes, which increase the risk of falling. The episode will address concerns specific to the 60-65 age group and emphasize the importance of being mindful of these changes. Recommendations will cater to the unique needs of older, untrained individuals to help them start exercising safely and effectively. Why it’s never too late to begin exercising and incorporating the four pillars of pillars of exercise [5:45] What do you say to the person who asks, “Is it too late for me to start doing this? Is it too late for me to worry about this and start making changes?”? Peter has spoken at length about the importance of exercise for longevity He’s had the same response largely for many years now Some people will have already heard him say this on another podcast, but truthfully I haven’t come up with a better analogy yet The analogy of saving for retirement So if you could be talking to somebody who’s in high school or college and you were talking to them through the lens of being a financial advisor, their fiduciary, what would you say? You would say, “Listen, there’s this really magical thing called compounding that Einstein basically said was the 8th wonder of the world. And you want to use it to maximum advantage.” To do that, you should start saving immediately When you get your first job, you should be saving If not, certainly by the time you get out of college, you should be saving And if you do that, you don’t really have to be that brilliant about it If you put all of your savings into an index fund at the age of 22, the probability that you are not going to be set when you retire is so low But what happens if you’re talking to somebody who’s 45 and due to life circumstances they just haven’t been able to save They haven’t made enough money to even have some disposable saving income Or they’ve saved and lost or invested badly or something like that Would you say, “Well, too bad?” No, of course you wouldn’t The point here is it is never too late to start saving for retirement, but you must understand something which is the longer you wait to start, the more you’re likely going to have to save, the greater return you’re going to need, and therefore probably the greater risk you’re going to take “It’s never too late to start saving and it’s never too late to start exercising. But I want the message to be ‘Don’t wait’”‒ Peter Attia Peter wants the message to be: don’t wait because of some reason and say, “Well, I’m going to wait till I’m older because…” Remind people of your 4 pillars and how you think about each of those pillars individually as someone is aging? It’s basically stability, strength, aerobic efficiency [zone 2], and peak aerobic output [zone 5] You could argue, “Well, those are just kind of a continuum.” Peter would say “Sure, but let’s not get lost in the semantics. Those things, if you define them the way I do, kind of constitute everything.” Stability is kind of a broad term, but embedded within stability is everything that enables you to dissipate force safely Everything that enables you to have balance and flexibility because believe it or not, those come from stability If you have balance by definition, you have stability You can’t have balance without stability, you can’t actually have flexibility without stability We think of training as having a purpose, and different types of training factor into these different activities There are some types of training that myopically hit 1 of these things If you’re riding a bike (like Peter does for zone 2 training), it is a very one-dimensional activity There are no degrees of freedom outside of you pedaling the crank And if you do it at a fixed power output that meets the criteria for zone 2, then you’re very narrowly targeting that You’re doing very little for any of the other systems Conversely, there are other types of training like rucking with a heavy weight on hills, you’re actually targeting all 4 of those elements That requires tremendous stability, moments of strength, large segments of aerobic base or aerobic efficiency, and moments of peak aerobic output and even anaerobic output That’s just something to keep in mind The gradual, then sharp, decline in muscle mass and activity level that occur with age [10:00] A few graphs Peter thinks are important {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Does xylitol increase risk of cardiovascular disease?",
      "content": "Earlier this month, a study published in the European Heart Journal reported that the common sugar substitute xylitol increased risk of blood clots and was associated with elevated risk of adverse cardiovascular events.¹ The Washington Post, CNN, and other mainstream news outlets quickly latched on to the story, fueling another round of widespread alarm and confusion. But as I read through the research article, I couldn’t help but notice that it seemed eerily familiar. The methods, the results, even the design of the figures – I could have sworn I’d seen this before. Then I looked at the list of authors, and it struck me. I had seen (and analyzed) this paper before. About a year ago, the same research group had published similar results on erythritol,² a sweetener within the same class of compounds as xylitol. And after comparing my analysis of that study with the results published this month, I found that the two papers also resembled each other in another way – namely, their similar shortcomings. A link between circulating xylitol and CV risk As in the erythritol study, investigators Witkowski et al. identified xylitol as a molecule of interest by analyzing fasting plasma samples from 1,157 participants who had undergone elective diagnostic cardiac evaluations (the “discovery cohort”). By conducting untargeted metabolomics analyses on these samples, the authors sought to determine which circulating compounds were associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: death, heart attack, or stroke) over a 3-year follow-up period. Regression analyses revealed that plasma xylitol levels were positively associated with MACE risk after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors such as age, blood pressure, lipid levels, smoking status, and levels of the inflammation marker hsCRP (HR=1.64; 95% CI: 1.05-2.56), P<0.05). The authors then validated this result in another, independent cohort (n=2,149) by conducting xylitol-specific metabolomic assays in fasting plasma samples and analyzing associations with MACE in 3-year follow-up data. Again, results showed a link between circulating xylitol levels and MACE incidence. Those in the highest xylitol tertile (T3) had a 57% higher risk of MACE than those in the lowest tertile (T1) after adjusting for other risk factors (HR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.12-2.21), P<0.01). (Differences in risk between tertiles 1 and 2 were not significant.) Xylitol and blood clotting Witkowski et al. then evaluated the possibility that xylitol might contribute to MACE risk by enhancing blood clotting, thus increasing risk of vascular blockage. They applied varying concentrations of xylitol or control solution to human platelet-rich plasma, and when combined with application of known platelet-activating factors, xylitol was found to enhance platelet activation and aggregation (early steps in blood clot formation) in a dose-dependent manner. However, it is worth noting that these experiments were only performed using xylitol levels near and above the upper limit of concentrations seen in human fasting plasma samples. As more direct evidence of xylitol effects on blood clotting, the authors injected mice with xylitol or control solution and found that xylitol resulted in faster clot formation – though again, the xylitol concentration used in this experiment was near the upper limit of physiological ranges observed in the human cohorts. Case closed? These results make a case for a correlation between circulating xylitol and MACE risk, and they indicate that such an association may reflect an effect of xylitol in promoting blood clotting (albeit only at the very highest xylitol levels observed in fasting plasma samples). Still, the authors also demonstrate that everyone is in danger of extraordinarily high circulating xylitol levels if the sweetener is included in one’s diet. The investigators had ten healthy participants consume a single xylitol-sweetened drink, which they note as being comparable in xylitol content to a pint of xylitol-sweetened ice cream. They then found that circulating levels spiked by as much as 1000x baseline values within 30 minutes – well over the minimum concentration at which clotting effects had been observed. Levels returned to baseline ranges within 4-6 hours after ingestion of the xylitol beverage. So can we conclude from these data that xylitol consumption increases risk of blood clots and cardiovascular events, end of story? Absolutely not. Diet isn’t the only source of xylitol The problem with interpreting these results as a condemnation of xylitol consumption is that diet isn’t the only source of circulating xylitol. This compound is also produced by our own bodies through a process known as the glucuronate pathway, one of the pathways by which we metabolize glucose. So how did the authors ensure they were investigating the relationship between dietary xylitol intake and MACE risk? They didn’t. The investigators did not collect any data on xylitol intake from their human cohort, so we have no way of correlating consumption with MACE risk because we have no way of knowing which participants were regularly consuming xylitol-containing foods. And although xylitol is currently a very common sweetening additive, Witkowski et al. note that the majority of their study participants were enrolled prior to xylitol’s widespread use, suggesting that circulating levels measured in their observational cohort may not be attributable to dietary intake. But for the sake of argument, let’s assume that all participants were exposed regularly through diet. Associations between circulating xylitol levels and MACE incidence derived from plasma samples taken after an overnight fast (>12 hours, according to the study protocol), whereas the results of xylitol time course experiments showed that the spike in circulating xylitol following dietary ingestion returns to baseline within six hours. This suggests that the reported positive association between xylitol and MACE risk were instead the result of endogenous production. Indeed, the authors point this out themselves: The rapid rate of xylitol excretion observed in healthy volunteers with return to near baseline (fasting) levels within hours following ingestion of a significant dietary exposure suggests that the plasma levels observed in our observational (validation) cohort represent variations in endogenous production/levels and not food intake. In other words, this study provides no evidence whatsoever that dietary xylitol intake has any association with MACE, yet still the authors insist on linking the two in their conclusions, claiming that their results evince “a direct effect of the low-calorie sweetener xylitol on platelet function and thrombosis potential.” Causality is unclear So we don’t know about dietary xylitol, but can we at least conclude that circulating xylitol – regardless of the source – is harmful? Again, the answer is a hard “no.” As with most observational studies, Witkowski et al.’s human investigations do not demonstrate causality. The authors present these data as evidence that xylitol raises MACE risk, but the fact that our bodies produce xylitol as a result of metabolic processes introduces a very high likelihood of a “third variable problem” – a situation in which two unrelated variables appear to be correlated because they are both influenced by a third, unknown variable. Glucuronate pathway activity – and therefore xylitol production – is elevated with diabetes, liver disease, and other inflammatory and metabolic derangements which might impact cardiovascular risk independently of effects on xylitol production.3,4 In other words, circulating xylitol is a covariate of countless other variables with well-established connections to cardiovascular risk and may simply be a read-out of overall metabolic health with no causal role in disease. The authors attempted to establish causality through their mechanistic experiments in mouse models and using platelet-rich plasma. Mice, however, are a notoriously poor model for human cardiovascular disease. Their lipid biology has key differences from that of humans, and unlike humans, they almost never develop coronary artery disease. Mice also demonstrated poor absorption of dietary xylitol in this study, necessitating injection of xylitol solutions, an exposure route which mimics neither human dietary intake nor human endogenous production. Indeed, in discussing their results, the authors devote substantial attention to differences in xylitol metabolism across mammalian species, underscoring the limited reliability of their findings in mice. In vitro experiments are often even less reliable as a model because they lack any whole-body context. Further, platelet-rich plasma is not representative of the concentration of platelets normally found in human blood, so not only did the investigators need to use unusually high concentrations of xylitol to see an effect on platelet aggregation, but they also needed unusually high concentrations of platelets. Rings a bell, but not an alarm First erythritol, now xylitol. This research group followed the same flawed design and ended up with the same flawed conclusions. SSDD – same [study], different day. Indeed, just as a fun way to prove the similarity between these papers and their flaws, I was able to reuse my earlier analysis nearly verbatim – so if you’re experiencing your own sense of déjà vu in reading this, rest assured that you’re certainly not alone. At best, this work shows that endogenous xylitol correlates with – but doesn’t necessarily contribute to – cardiovascular risk. Far from condemning xylitol as an ingredient in foods and beverages, these data provide no insight whatsoever on potential negative effects of dietary xylitol intake, whereas other evidence (some of which I discussed in a premium article on sugar substitutes more broadly) indicates that xylitol may even offer advantages for health. So in summary, this work should ring a few bells – but there’s no need for it to ring any alarms.

Previous rapid-fire AMAs have been well-received. This format allows covering a variety of topics and questions more broadly. Answers will be more conversational, similar to how Peter would speak to a patient. Topics include: Preventing cognitive decline Various nutrition questions Relationship between cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease Weight loss and longevity Fasting Blood pressure Step requirements And more. Peter has recently shifted his in-person presentations from a lecture format to a Q&A format and has found it a better style for the listeners He believes a well-moderated Q&A is generally more engaging for the audience. Preventing cognitive decline [5:00] If someone came to Peter and said, “What’s the best thing I can do? How can I prevent cognitive decline in my life,” what would Peter say to them? Well, there is a “playbook” of modifiable behaviors that one can do to reduce your risk of dementia and prevent cognitive decline That said, genetics does play a role in cognitive decline (e.g., APOE4 gene and probably others we’re not yet aware of) Outside of that, what can you do with respect to your behavior to reduce the risk? The overlap between reducing the risk of a disease known as dementia is virtually identical to the steps you take to reduce the risk of cognitive decline Are there differences? Sure there are If you’re talking about patients in whom we’re trying to reduce the risk of dementia, and for example, we see serum markers of low amounts of amyloid accumulation, we may actually turn to pharmaceutical agents that reduce the amount of amyloid there So that’s something that wouldn’t be in the playbook. Let’s now talk about cognitive decline in the NON-pathologic sense Three most important things: Exercise Exercise is the most powerful in terms of magnitude, effect size, and the preservation of cognitive function Both strength training and cardio are essential — it’s not an either/or situation ⇒ See AMA #46 all about brain health Metabolic health The brain, this tiny organ, is roughly 2% of your body weight and yet approximately 20% of your metabolic demand if you think about that enormous asymmetry, it tells you that anything that plays a role in fuel partitioning and energetics is going to have an outsized impact on your brain And all of that points towards having remarkable fuel partitioning, being very insulin sensitive and being very metabolically flexible If you dispose of glucose very efficiently, you are by definition very metabolically flexible, which means you are able to access as substrate both fatty acid and glucose for ATP production the most obvious example of this is if you look at people at the far end of the spectrum in terms of metabolic inflexibility, we see that in the disease state of type two diabetes and in people with type two diabetes, the increase in the risk for Alzheimer’s disease, depending on where you look, could be anywhere from 40 to even 100% “And the good news is those go hand in hand. Exercise is one of the most important tools to increase metabolic flexibility.” says Peter Sleep The epidemiology would suggest that if an individual is not sleeping in appropriate length or stages, their increase in Alzheimer’s disease specifically, but probably in other forms of dementia, also goes up See: The connection between sleep and Alzheimer’s disease Sleep is not a passive thing, it’s an active form of recovery for the brain Cognitive activities So after those three things, the next most important thing is what you actually do with your brain and body Engage in complex activities that combine brain and body (e.g., dancing, learning new skills). More beneficial than simpler mental exercises like crossword puzzles. Practical examples: Peter’s father, at almost 87 years old, still works daily, which keeps his brain active and sharp. Peter likes driving (like his F1 simulator) because driving is one of those things that involves so many senses, so your eyes, your ears, and your proprioceptive vestibular system Peter on “retirement” from work “We should think about retiring as a time when we don’t work for money anymore. But I really think it’s probably important that people are working throughout their entire lives, meaning they’re working on something that is keeping their brain challenged.” —Peter Attia Supplements Supplements exist but are less impactful compared to exercise, metabolic health, and sleep. The mentioned lifestyle factors have a significantly much larger effect on preventing cognitive decline.

      "title": "Is Alzheimer’s disease unavoidable for individuals with a high-risk APOE genotype?",
      "content": "Last month, results from a widely publicized study¹ seemed to spell doom for millions of individuals in the US and around the world. Authors Fortea et al. reported that having two copies of the APOE-ε4 gene variant, long known to be associated with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), instead represented a form of genetically determined AD – meaning that, for the roughly 2% of the population carrying this genotype, development of the disease is not only more likely, it is nearly guaranteed. The grim news has naturally been met with alarm and despair, but is the hopelessness justified? Or is this yet another case of bold claims and flashy headlines without sufficient scientific validation? A brief refresher on AD genetics and the APOE gene Though we have previously discussed APOE gene variants and AD risk in detail on The Drive, a few overview points are worth reiterating in order to provide context for Fortea et al.’s study. Genetics have long been known to affect AD risk, but different genes vary in their relative impact. For certain key genes (most notably, PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP), mutations are virtually deterministic – conferring a nearly 100% chance of developing AD, typically at a relatively young age. However, such highly penetrant mutations are rare, accounting for only ~1% of all AD cases combined. More often, genetics plays a subtler role, with more common genetic variants imparting modest increases or decreases in risk. Of these non-deterministic genes, APOE is recognized as having the strongest association with AD risk. Three different variants of this gene (known as “alleles”) exist in the human population – ε2, ε3, and ε4 – and of these, the ε4 allele is associated with the highest risk of developing AD. However, each of us has two copies of the APOE gene (making for six possible combinations of alleles), and while having one copy of the ε4 allele is associated with a moderate elevation in risk relative to other genotypes (about 2 to 3x), having two copies raises risk far more dramatically (about 8 to 10x). Yet even among these APOE-ε4/ε4 individuals, development of Alzheimer’s disease is not regarded as genetically determined – in other words, it is far from inevitable, with prior work showing that risk associated with this genotype varies based on several factors including biological sex, ethnicity, environment, and lifestyle. At least, such was the mindset prior to Fortea et al.’s recent publication. About the study The investigators set out to assess whether an APOE-ε4/ε4 genotype might indeed constitute a highly penetrant, genetically determined form of Alzheimer’s disease. They utilized postmortem data from 3,297 brain donors from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), as well as clinical data – including data on AD biomarkers and on diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and AD – from 10,039 living individuals across five large multicenter cohorts. The researchers used this information to evaluate the prevalence and progression of AD among APOE-ε4/ε4 individuals, principally comparing against APOE-ε3/ε3 individuals (the most common APOE genotype, accounting for an estimated 50-55% of the overall population). Results indicated that the penetrance of the APOE-ε4/ε4 genotype may be close to 100%, far greater than previously thought. The authors reported that “nearly all” postmortem APOE-ε4/ε4 brains demonstrated AD-related neuropathological changes classified as either “high” or “intermediate.” In living subjects, data on abnormal amyloid and tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid indicated that levels of both biomarkers were consistently higher among ε4/ε4 individuals than among ε3/ε3s starting around age 55. Further, APOE-ε4/ε4 individuals were found to reach diagnostic milestones 7–10 years earlier than APOE-ε3/ε3 individuals, with ε4/ε4s experiencing early AD symptoms at an average age of 65.6, mild cognitive impairment at age 71.8, dementia at age 73.6, and death at age 77.2. Together, these results suggest that APOE-ε4/ε4 is highly penetrant for AD – to the point that it might be regarded as deterministic rather than as a mere risk factor – and that it is associated with earlier disease onset than cases of AD occuring in the context of other genotypes. What do these results add to existing knowledge? As explained earlier, the APOE-ε4 allele was already known to confer an elevated risk of AD in a dose-dependent manner, with the APOE-ε4/ε4 genotype associated with far greater risk than any other APOE genotype. Previous research has also already established that disease onset occurs at a younger age, on average, among APOE-ε4/ε4 individuals than among those with other genotypes.² So what new information does Fortea et al.’s study provide? The novel finding of this study is that the APOE-ε4/ε4 genotype demonstrates near-complete penetrance for AD and should thus be considered to be a genetically determined form of the disease rather than simply a risk factor. Indeed, if we take these results at face value, AD would be far more heritable than previously thought, and AD caused by the APOE-ε4/ε4 genotype would represent not only the most common form of genetically determined AD, but one of the most common Mendelian genetic diseases in general. If we take these results at face value. There’s more to AD than biomarkers A strength of this study is its reliance on multiple readouts; postmortem neuropathology assessments, AD biomarker data from living subjects, and data on cognitive symptoms were all consistent in pointing toward the authors’ conclusion that APOE-ε4/ε4 is deterministic for AD. But importantly, these lines of evidence were all independent. Neuropathology data from a given brain might suggest the presence of AD, but that does not guarantee that the patient in question had ever exhibited clinical symptoms or had an AD diagnosis. Likewise, we have no indication that higher levels of AD biomarkers among APOE-ε4/ε4 individuals corresponded to greater cognitive deficits among the same individuals. AD is a clinico-pathological diagnosis, meaning that it requires both positive results from biomarker tests and the presence of cognitive symptoms. While the investigators provide data on age of onset for cognitive symptoms and AD diagnoses, they do not share information on the proportion of individuals who met these clinical milestones. In other words, their conclusions regarding prevalence derive from neuropathology and biomarker data alone, which are notoriously imperfect correlates of functional cognitive decline. A case study in sampling bias Further, even if we do assume alignment across the various lines of evidence, consistency in results should not be confused for accuracy in results, as systematic errors can influence multiple data streams in similar ways. In the case of the Fortea et al. study, systematic error took the form of heavy sampling bias in the datasets used for their various analyses. Imagine walking into an AD support group meeting, taking a quick poll, and finding that everyone present has been diagnosed with AD. Would you then conclude that 100% of the world’s population has AD? Of course not. And yet, when a similar process and logic was applied by Fortea et al., the news was published in Nature Medicine and broadcast across mainstream media. Postmortem data were obtained from the NACC, while clinical data from were obtained from five separate cohorts: Alfa plus (Alzheimer’s and Families cohort), the A4 clinical trial, OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies), the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention. All six of these data sources were aimed at studying dementia or AD specifically, and many targeted participants at higher than average AD risk independent of APOE genotype (e.g., those with evidence of amyloid plaques or cognitive impairment at baseline). Thus, we can safely assume that each of these cohorts included a much higher proportion of individuals with AD or at high risk of AD than would be found in the overall population, and while such cohorts have utility for studying biomarkers, progression, treatments, and countless other aspects of the disease, extrapolating their data to determine prevalence of AD in the general population is as meaningless as our hypothetical AD support group analysis. Indeed, the NACC specifically states on its website that their data “are not suited for an analysis of dementia incidence or prevalence” because their sampling (which was based on volunteers and referrals) cannot be assumed to represent the broader population. In a cohort intended for Alzheimer’s research, who do you expect is most likely to be among those volunteers and referrals? For those who need further convincing, we need only look at Fortea et al.’s results from APOE-ε3/ε3 individuals. The authors report that 50% of ε3/ε3 postmortem brains had high or intermediate levels of AD-related neuropathology changes, and 54% of ε3/ε3s in the pooled clinical cohorts had been diagnosed with AD dementia. If we extrapolate these data to the general population, we would need to conclude that the vast majority of humans on the planet have at least a 1-in-2 chance of AD, which very clearly is not the case! Frankly, the fact that this enormous flaw was overlooked by the journal, the popular press, and the study authors themselves is nothing short of shameful and irresponsible. The result of this oversight has been undue emotional stress for those who have (or care about someone who has) an APOE-ε4/ε4 genotype – and perhaps, an unjustified loss of faith in risk mitigation strategies (discussed in detail in AMA #46) for which we have prior evidence of efficacy. No need for hopelessness This study appears to paint a bleak picture in which Alzheimer’s disease is an unavoidable fate for individuals with two copies of the APOE-ε4 allele, but fortunately, closer inspection reveals that this hopelessness is unfounded. In actuality, we can blame biased sample selection across all included cohorts for vastly inflating the apparent risk of AD associated with this genotype – and indeed, with any genotype – well beyond what would be seen in a general population. It’s worth noting, however, that this sampling bias does not necessarily invalidate the within-cohort comparisons between those with APOE-ε4/ε4 genotypes versus those with APOE-ε3/ε3 – i.e., the results showing earlier disease development among the former and a general pattern of higher prevalence (though we shouldn’t put any stock in the exact ratio of risk between genotypes as reported here). Our critique of Fortea et al.’s findings with regard to overall AD prevalence among ε4/ε4s thus should not be interpreted as any indication that this genotype isn’t a significant risk factor for the disease – but again, we already had ample evidence that this was the case. Yet “elevated risk” is a far cry from “guarantee” – leaving plenty of room for each of us to influence our own fate through other risk-mitigation strategies such as maintaining metabolic and cardiovascular health. Previous work has shown such strategies to be effective irrespective of APOE genotype, further demonstrating that AD is far from a sealed fate for APOE-ε4/ε4s. So to the millions who carry this high-risk genotype, there’s no reason to lose hope, but there’s every reason to take action toward cognitive and overall health.

      "content": "Sufficient protein consumption is critical for health and longevity. Too little protein in the diet leads to low muscle mass, which in turn is strongly associated with increased mortality risk. We have frequently pointed out why the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram (kg) of body weight per day is too low, and my team generally recommends a daily intake of at least twice that amount – around 1.6 to 2 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight. Many active individuals and those seeking to build muscle aim for even higher levels of protein intake,1 raising the question: is there such a thing as too much? Mechanistic data on the effects of protein on cellular signaling pathways have led to a hypothesis that excess protein intake promotes the development and progression of cancer, an idea that has been widely spread by advocates for protein restriction. However, the fact that a given hypothesis is mechanistically plausible does not necessarily mean that it is true, and in evaluating how protein intake impacts cancer risk, we must adopt a wider perspective. While randomized trials addressing this question are lacking, combining human epidemiological studies with a closer look at mechanistic studies paints a more nuanced picture of the relationship between protein and cancer.",

Why? Val explained the history of HRV, and this is interesting because it goes way back to the 1700s (awareness of beat-to-beat intervals) The Chinese have used pulse medicine for a long time The Russians were ahead of the game as far as application of HRV In the 1950s, they were aware that from an ECG you could pull out these beat-to-beat intervals and get something more than just heart rate When they sent the first human being in space (Yuri Gagarin), they were able to send back the ECG and some respiratory data and see fundamentally what happened to people when you shot them into space They saw as soon as he went into space, his HRV went way up Probably because you have changes in blood pressure, you have less gravity so you don’t have to have as much muscle activity They started using this in the ‘60s, which is fascinating because it wasn’t seen in Western literature until decades later They dominated the Olympics in 1980 They had a very elaborate drug program and an elaborate training program In the mid-80s they started figuring out how to use this tech for sport performance They put together an engineering team and they started collecting data on thousands of Russian athletes of all levels from their school age kids all the way up to the Olympic athletes They collected just populational norms They started building the system that was meant to monitor training and be used for training They spent years working on this platform, but before they could finish it, the Soviet Union collapsed and the team involved dispersed By chance, a lot of them were involved in track and field and different sports They ended up reconvening at a track meet in Eugene and talking about this past project They decide that they want to get together and keep working on this because they’d never brought to fruition, and they did That was the first system commercially available for sport and fitness, and this is what Joel was introduced to at the time The first HRV system It was a very research heavy, medical type system that was not easy to interpret Joel didn’t have $35,000 to buy it, but he convinced them to let him help them introduce it to teams across the US and gain some exposure for them He started using it It gave you 12 or 14 different metrics of heart rate variability It required you to connect electrodes to people before you’d measure them Joel explains, “That introduction to it ,where I started this whole journey and 20 years of looking at data and coaching people and trying to understand what the data was telling me and how it aligned with all these other metrics, [it] has really just led down this path of how you get to heart rate variability today.” He spent the next 20 years coaching with it Looking at HRV, he opened a gym, he worked with lots of fighters, athletes, different teams, military groups Methods of measuring HRV: EKG, wrist-based sensors, and more [11:30] When Joel was first introduced to HRV and it was done off an EKG, Peter assumes that 3 leads would be sufficient You could get it from 3 leads but they used 6 Is EKG still the gold standard for measuring HRV? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Reducing heavy alcohol intake: a lifeline for cardiovascular health",
      "content": "Excessive alcohol consumption is a pervasive behavior, often with significant implications for both personal and public health. While we’ve recently covered the ongoing debate about the health effects of low-to-moderate alcohol consumption, heavy alcohol consumption is a well-established risk factor for numerous adverse health outcomes, including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The wealth of evidence supporting a causal link between heavy alcohol use and cardiovascular disease certainly might motivate some to reduce their intake, but for many with a long history of heavy drinking, there is a perception that the “damage is already done,” such that any attempt at reducing intake would prove pointless. Thus, understanding and defining the exact impact of changes in drinking habits on cardiovascular health is crucial. Recent research by Kang et al. investigated just this question¹: can reducing heavy alcohol intake to mild, or even moderate levels, significantly lower cardiovascular risk, or is the “damage already done”? Study overview This cohort study explored the impact of reducing alcohol consumption on the risk of MACE in individuals with a history of heavy drinking using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service–Health Screening (NHIS-HEALS) database, which includes information on demographics, medical histories, lifestyles, and laboratory results from a large, representative sample of the South Korean population. The study analyzed data from 21,011 individuals aged 40 to 79, all of whom met criteria for “heavy drinking” – defined as consuming >4 drinks (56 grams) per day or >14 drinks (196 grams) per week for males, and >3 drinks (42 grams) per day or >7 drinks (98 grams) per week for females – over a preliminary health examination period (2005-2008). In a second health examination period (2009-2012), participants were then divided into two groups based on whether they continued to meet the criteria for heavy drinking (sustained heavy drinking) or reduced their alcohol consumption to mild-to-moderate levels – defined as up to 4 drinks (56 grams) per day or up to 14 drinks (196 grams) per week for males, and up to 3 drinks (42 grams) per day or up to 7 drinks (98 grams) per week for females. Alcohol consumption levels were assessed using self-report questionnaires administered during health examinations. The primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of MACE, which encompassed nonfatal myocardial infarction, angina (chest pain) requiring revascularization, any stroke, and all-cause mortality. Moreover, the authors analyzed and controlled for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, physical activity level, and the presence of medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. Key findings Over the follow-up period of 162,378 person-years, participants who reduced their alcohol consumption exhibited a 23% lower risk of MACE compared to those who continued heavy drinking (HR=0.77; 95% CI: 0.67-0.88). In addition to the primary composite outcome, the researchers also examined risk of individual conditions included under the MACE umbrella and likewise noted lower risk for many of these conditions among those who had reduced their alcohol intake. Specifically, participants who reduced their drinking experienced a 30% decrease in risk of angina (HR=0.70; 95% CI: 0.51-0.97), a 34% decrease in risk of ischemic stroke (HR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.51-0.86), a 28% decrease in risk of any stroke (HR=0.72; 95% CI: 0.57-0.91), a 29% decrease in risk of coronary artery disease (HR=0.71; 95% CI: 0.52-0.98), and, finally, a 21% decrease in risk of all-cause death (HR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.66-0.96). However, similar benefits of reducing alcohol intake were not observed for hemorrhagic stroke and nonfatal MI, which authors Kang et al. suggested might, in theory, be explained by changes in platelet function and coagulation factors linked with moderate alcohol consumption, potentially increasing the risk of hemorrhagic events. Still, overall these results tell an encouraging story: even for those with a history of heavy drinking, reducing alcohol intake can lead to substantial cardiovascular benefits. Some biases might inflate the apparent effect size… The study is not without significant limitations. The observational nature of the study means that causality can’t be definitively established. Although the time-exposure design strengthens the association between reduced alcohol consumption and improved cardiovascular outcomes, it does not eliminate the possibility that confounding factors might have influenced results. For instance, individuals who consume alcohol heavily often lead a more sedentary lifestyle and are more likely to smoke and have a poor diet, potentially exerting a substantial influence on cardiovascular health. Likewise, individuals who decide to reduce their alcohol intake may also be making other health-conscious decisions simultaneously. For example, a person who cuts down on drinking might also adopt a healthier diet, increase their physical activity levels, or stop smoking – all behaviors with well-documented impacts on cardiovascular health. Since a person who chooses to drink less is also likely to engage in other healthy behaviors – and because these factors can independently affect cardiovascular health – other lifestyle changes might confound the observed association between reduced alcohol consumption and MACE. In fact, when examining the baseline characteristics between the groups, it becomes evident that the group that ultimately continued to drink heavily was less healthy at baseline in terms of the several lifestyle-associated aspects than those who subsequently reduced their intake – with higher rates of obesity (42.5% vs. 38.6%) and greater fraction of participants currently smoking (40.1% vs. 31.6%). This observation supports the idea that those who reduced their alcohol consumption were already engaging in some other healthier behaviors than their sustained-drinking counterparts. Despite rigorous statistical adjustments, accounting for these interconnected behaviors and their individual contributions to health outcomes is challenging. This is further complicated by the fact that observational studies often rely on self-reported data for these lifestyle factors, which can also bias the data, especially if participants are asked to recall their drinking habits over a long period. Variability and potential for inaccuracy are inherent in self-reported data and can affect the study’s outcomes. …While other biases might detract from it On the other hand, other biases might lead to an underestimation of the association between reduced alcohol intake and lower MACE risk to an extent. For instance, self-reporting is more likely to result in participants underreporting, rather than overreporting, their alcohol intake in order to align with social norms that discourage heavy drinking. The resulting underestimation of actual alcohol intake could thus lead to underestimation of the cardiovascular benefits associated with reducing alcohol consumption. Consequently, the study’s outcomes and conclusions might not fully capture the extent of the health improvements experienced by those who genuinely reduced their drinking. Additionally, it’s probable that some of those who reduced their alcohol intake did so because of other cardiovascular risk factors placing them at higher risk – including factors which may have developed or come to light after baseline data were taken. In order to ensure that the observed effects on cardiovascular outcomes were more accurately attributable to changes in alcohol consumption levels (from heavy to mild-to-moderate) rather than to other health conditions that might have led participants to quit drinking (i.e., the “sick-quitter” effect), the investigators excluded individuals who completely abstained from alcohol drinking during the follow-up period were excluded. However, this exclusion did not account for those who may have simply reduced their drinking (rather than ceasing completely) in response to revelations about emerging health issues or other risk factors or markers for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In other words, causality was likely reversed in a subset of individuals who, despite reducing their drinking, likely had a higher risk for CVD events due to pre-existing health conditions not included in baseline characteristics. Depending on the extent of this issue across the cohort, the observed cardiovascular benefits reported in the study might actually be underestimated. So where does that leave us? The sick-quitter effect (leading to underestimation of alcohol consumption and its risks) and inadequate control for probable healthy lifestyle changes (which might overestimate the health benefits of reduced drinking) present opposing potential influences on the direction of error in the size of the reported effect. But while we may not be sure about the exact magnitude of the true effect, to some extent, it doesn’t matter, as it’s extremely unlikely that the effect doesn’t exist at all. The size of the observed effect is substantial and actually increased after accounting for confounding variables (crude HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.74-0.94 vs. adjusted HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.67-0.88), making it improbable that other unmeasured confounders could completely explain the reported outcomes. This implies that while the precise magnitude of the effect may be subject to debate – whether a bit smaller or larger than reported – the presence of a significant effect is virtually certain. Moreover, the authors conducted separate sub-analyses stratified by various baseline demographic and health factors and found that the direction of the association persisted across subgroups, further strengthening the likelihood of a true effect. Though associations did not always achieve statistical significance for the various subgroups (likely due to inadequate statistical power among the smaller sub-cohorts), the overall trend toward reduced cardiovascular risk with reduced alcohol consumption was remarkably consistent between sexes, across physical activity levels, in smokers and non-smokers, for those both under and over age 65, and both normal-weight and overweight individuals, underscoring the broad applicability of these findings for diverse populations. Indeed, even considering subgroups of those who were already suffering from major health concerns at baseline (including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation), cutting alcohol was associated with comparable or even greater reductions in MACE risk than among subgroups without these conditions, indicating that making this particular step toward a healthier lifestyle can substantially improve health trajectories even later in life or after negative health conditions have already arisen. A modest change with universal benefits Kang et al. demonstrated that even modest reduction in alcohol consumption is associated with significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular events. For many individuals, the prospect of completely quitting alcohol might seem daunting or unattainable. However, Kang et al.’s findings offer a more achievable goal, as they show that substantial health benefits can be gained by cutting down to moderate drinking levels – and they show that the benefits apply to everyone. The cardiovascular benefits of reduced alcohol consumption were consistent across various subgroups for various demographic and health variables, dispelling the myth that certain individuals, based on their age or other health conditions, might be “too far gone” to benefit from reducing their alcohol intake. Whether you’re in your forties or your seventies, have overweight or average weight, the study indicates that the positive effects of reducing alcohol intake apply broadly. Bottom line: it’s not too late! Even with a history of heavy drinking, the answer to the question posed at the beginning of this newsletter is that, no, the damage is not already done; there is ample opportunity for improvement that translates into real risk reduction and the potential for a longer, healthier life. The study by Kang et al. highlights a critical but often overlooked aspect of cardiovascular health – the significant benefits of reducing heavy alcohol intake even after years of excessive consumption. Their work underscores that in this context, it is not too late to make positive changes for cardiovascular health and that efforts to do so would be far from futile, reaffirming the power of lifestyle change and personal choice – including the choice to seek support and help – in shaping one’s health trajectory. So, if you’re contemplating whether to cut back on alcohol, the message is clear: even modest reductions can significantly enhance heart health at any stage and for anyone.

      "title": "High Lp(a) warrants intervention, even without other cardiovascular risk factors",
      "content": "When considering how to assess and reduce one’s risk of chronic disease, it’s often tempting to focus solely on modifiable risk factors. For instance, we can quit smoking, lose excess fat mass, or take medications to reduce elevated blood pressure or cholesterol levels. But when it comes to risk assessments and management strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD), one non-modifiable factor should never be ignored: lipoprotein(a), known more commonly as Lp(a). As explained on the podcast by Dr. Benoit Arsenault, elevated Lp(a) is the single most important – and most prevalent – hereditary risk factor for CVD, yet we currently lack any simple means of addressing it therapeutically. Indeed, in the absence of options for reducing high Lp(a), many physicians do not even bother to test this variable. But results from a new study highlight just how critical Lp(a) is for CVD risk assessment – and how, despite the lack of options for modifying one’s Lp(a) levels, this metric can nevertheless have substantial implications for risk management decisions. Study design and cohort The retrospective study by Shiyovich et al. investigated the association between Lp(a) and incident acute myocardial infarction (MI, otherwise known as a heart attack), as well as how this association was related to standard modifiable risk factors (SMuRFs) for heart disease.¹ (I will admit, it is a bit difficult for me to keep writing the word “SMuRFs” without thinking of, well, you know.) The researchers utilized data from 6,238 adults (mean age: 54; 45% female) who had undergone routine Lp(a) testing in the Boston area between January 2000 and July 2019 (derived from the Mass General Brigham Lp(a) Registry). Data from individuals with severe kidney dysfunction, cancer, or prior known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were excluded from the study. Participants were followed for a median of 8.8 years to assess incidence of fatal or non-fatal MI. Participants were classified as having “high Lp(a)” if their Lp(a) levels exceeded the 90th percentile (based on established whole-population reference ranges) or “low Lp(a)” if their Lp(a) levels were below the 50th percentile, corresponding to >168 nmol/L and <19 nmol/L for high and low cutoffs, respectively. Overall, Lp(a) levels among participants were slightly lower than those of the general population, with 58% of participants meeting the definition of low Lp(a) and 7% of participants meeting the definition of high Lp(a). SMURFs were defined as hypertension, smoking, diabetes, or non-Lp(a) dyslipidemia, with non-Lp(a) dyslipidemia being defined as: 1) total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL; (2) LDL cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL; (3) HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dL in men or <50 mg/dL in women; or (5) total triglycerides ≥175 mg/dL. Notably, a fairly large proportion of participants (23.7%) had no SMuRFs, while 17.8% had at least three. As numbers of SMuRFs increased, rates of high Lp(a) also increased modestly, and rates of low Lp(a) decreased. Heart attack risk increases with SMuRFs and high Lp(a) The authors reported that a total of 234 participants (3.75%) experienced an acute MI over the follow-up period. As expected, a higher number of SMuRFs was associated with increased risk of incident MI across the entire cohort, with two SMuRFs corresponding to a threefold increase in risk relative to no SMuRFs (HR=3.05; 95% CI: 1.93-4.83; P<0.001) and ≥3 SMuRFs corresponding to a 6.5-fold increase in risk (HR=6.51; 95% CI: 4.18-10.16; P<0.001). This trend persisted when low-Lp(a) and high-Lp(a) subgroups were analyzed independently. Not really surprising. But the most critical finding from the study was that high Lp(a) was associated with a greater risk of MI than low Lp(a) across all numbers of SMuRFs (see Figure below), indicating that elevated Lp(a) is a major risk factor for heart attack regardless of the presence or absence of other risk factors. Indeed, Shiyovich et al. reported that risk among those with high Lp(a) was over 3x that of those with low Lp(a) (HR=3.19; 95% CI: 2.20-4.65; P<0.001), making the increased risk imparted by high Lp(a) equivalent to the increase in risk associated with having two SMuRFs. Figure: Incidence rates of acute myocardial infarction for subgroups defined by the number of standard modifiable risk factors (SMuRFs) and low versus high Lp(a). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Green arrow shows how high Lp(a) imparts an excess risk comparable to that associated with two SMuRFs. Modified from Shiyovich et al. 2024. How does this impact CVD risk management decisions? These results indicate that high Lp(a) is a major risk factor for CVD no matter what other risk factors a patient may or may not have, and therefore, patients with high Lp(a) should always be treated aggressively. But as we mentioned earlier, we lack pharmacological or behavioral options for reducing Lp(a) levels. (Some physicians use PCSK9 inhibitors off-label to lower Lp(a) by ~25%, but results are highly variable, and this level of Lp(a) reduction may not be sufficient to significantly reduce CVD risk.) So although this study confirms the strong association between elevated Lp(a) and risk of cardiovascular events, is there any practical utility to this knowledge? Is it worth it to find out you have high Lp(a) if you can’t do anything to lower it? Absolutely. While we may not be able to reduce Lp(a) itself, we can reduce overall CVD risk by treating other CVD risk factors. The discovery that a particular patient has high Lp(a) can thus serve as a sign that hypertension, diabetes, and especially elevated apoB levels (or less accurately, LDL-C) should be managed more aggressively than they otherwise might be in order to offset the risk imparted by Lp(a). The bottom line The study by Shiyovich et al. underscores that high Lp(a) is a major, hereditary risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, even among those with no other red flags, yet many who have high Lp(a) are unaware of it due to the fact that this metric is often ignored and undertested. Fortunately, awareness of the importance of Lp(a) for CVD risk is growing; an increasing number of healthcare facilities test for this variable, and several companies have even begun to market direct-to-consumer, at-home Lp(a) test kits. But ultimately, simply knowing one has high Lp(a) is just the first step. To reduce risk of CVD events, this information must be used to motivate more aggressive approaches toward other, modifiable risk factors.

The first time klotho crossed her radar She was a junior faculty thinking about what to focus on, “What was going to be our chance to do something big and important?” She was intrigued by a few decades of work showing that aging itself was malleable Cynthia Kenyon demonstrated that tweaking genetics in worms could dramatically increase their lifespan Her work knocked-out an analog of one of the IGF genes, DAF-16 Dena wanted to know if that could have effects in the brain Klotho had emerged as a longevity factor, and it was a chance to understand: could klotho do something in the brain? Very little was known about klotho when she started A colleague had observed that the levels decrease in the white matter of monkey brains, that a variant of klotho that we can talk about in a bit was associated with decreased stroke risk The person who discovered klotho had noted that mice without klotho moved slowly and they were cognitively a little slow Dena was the right person at the right time, and had the chance to really dig in It was risky to start with something that not much was known about in the brain, but it was a chance to do something maybe big and important The discovery of klotho is such a story of serendipity It was in 1997, Makoto Kuro-o, a Japanese scientist accidentally discovered klotho He was studying hypertension and he engineered a mouse to insert a gene, and then he noticed that in a few lines of these mice, maybe it was just one line of these mice, there was this premature aging phenotype The mice lived to about 3 months instead of about 30 months They developed normally, but around 2 weeks of age they became progeroid: they looked like they were rapidly aging with osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, emphysema, and they moved slow They looked really old So, he went back to that mouse and he mapped out what had been disrupted, and that was klotho That was the first time klotho was found, and he named it after the Greek fate (Clotho) who spins the thread of life, daughter of Zeus He named it K-L-O-T-H-O in homage to his discovery His name is Kuro-o And a longevity factor isn’t something that just causes premature aging if disrupted So, it was very important for him to then go back and see what would happen if he overexpressed it He engineered mice to overexpress klotho, and those mice lived 30% longer That showed that klotho is a longevity factor ‒ disruption caused premature aging and overexpression extended lifespan Peter adds, “It’s a great story for people especially maybe who don’t do or haven’t done science because it illustrates the role of curiosity and serendipity.” There are some people who maybe wouldn’t have even gone back and done the experiments that he did to understand what turned out to be the most relevant thing “He followed the science, he opened the field. He looked into the mistake, the oops of science. And here we are, maybe on the cusp of a new therapy.”‒ Dena Dubal Biological properties of klotho: production, regulation, decline with age, and factors influencing its levels [11:45] Klotho itself is a pretty big protein: it’s about a 1,000 amino acids, by weight maybe 130 kilodaltons It codes for a type I transmembrane protein Which means that its N-terminus will sit in the extracellular space, it has one pass through the membrane, and its C-terminus is inside the cell {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Oldies-But-Goodies, May 2024 Edition",
      "content": "The world of biomedical science is constantly evolving, and I’ve often discussed how my ways of thinking have shifted over the years as new insights have come to light. But in evaluating what has changed, it’s also important to take note of information and ideas that have remained relevant and valuable despite the time that has passed. So this week, I’m sharing a collection of oldies-but-goodies – pieces from our newsletter archive that address a variety of topics of continued interest to our audience. Some provide additional context for recent or upcoming content; some address frequently asked questions, and some are simply worth repeating for anyone who might have missed them. Are continuous glucose monitors a waste of time for people without diabetes? Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are a topic of frequent questions from our patients and audience, and this newsletter, originally shared in June 2021, offers some of my reasoning behind my continued belief that CGMs provide worthwhile health information even outside of the context of diagnosed type II diabetes. (Additionally, this piece serves as useful background for an upcoming premium article covering glucose tolerance metrics more comprehensively.) Does fish oil cause cardiac arrhythmia in high-risk individuals? I’ve discussed fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids on various occasions on The Drive, usually in the context of their potential benefits for cardiovascular or cognitive health. But certain research papers and popular press articles over the last few years have drawn attention to a link between fish oil and cardiac arrhythmias (specifically, atrial fibrillation), prompting several questions from our audience on this topic. While I would like to revisit this subject in greater detail in the future, this newsletter from November 2021 summarizes my views and how I approach fish oil and arrhythmia risks with my patients. Nutritional epidemiology: abolition vs defending the status quo I have often railed against the many problems with nutritional epidemiology, but in this article, I summarized insights from a review by Dr. David Allison on possible solutions that might improve the field and increase the reliability and utility of epidemiological data. A previous guest on the podcast, David will soon be joining me for a second discussion on nutritional epidemiology and other aspects of obesity research. Has he seen any progress with his proposed improvements to the field? Prioritizing “real friends” over “deal friends” It’s easy to forget that mental and emotional health are just as important for lifespan and healthspan as our attempts to stay lean, slow cellular aging, and avoid cancer, and an essential element of good mental and emotional health is close friendships. This piece from August 2022 reminds us to evaluate our social networks and take the time to create deep, meaningful connections beyond the transactional nature of many acquaintanceships in modern society. The Epidemic on the Road Traffic fatalities have seen a sharp rise over the last decade. This newsletter, which serves as a nice primer for my recent podcast interview with road safety expert Mark Rosekind, describes the scope of the problem and how the COVID-19 pandemic is thought to still influence driving habits and traffic safety.

It’s not for lack of trying There have been some devices like the MARS machine that have been developed The bulk of liver disease has historically been chronic, and so you have time for intervention It’s the acute phases that we really need either a 3D printed liver or an accessory liver that could function either inside the body or outside of the body Those efforts are being undertaken, but it both hearkens to the complexity of what the liver does and how hard it is to mimic when the liver is injured, what it can do It also gives you a focus on the panoply of liver diseases, the timeline to development of liver disease, and the functional aspect of what it takes to actually get some of these devices to market Peter’s story from his time at Hopkins One of the attendings who had trained at one of the universities in Virginia told a story about when he was in his training: they were using baboons as a bridge to transplantation (not xenotransplantation) They would literally put a baboon in a bed next to the human in acute liver failure They would run conduits between them and obviously they had somehow ABO matched the baboon to the human, and they would basically circulate the human’s blood through the baboon using the baboon’s liver to detoxify and carry out gluconeogenesis (or whatever other features were critical in the acute moment) Apparently, this somewhat worked You could take a person who was completely jaundiced, on the verge of death and buy them another week or so until a liver transplant showed up According to the story of this one attending, it worked really well until once a patient emerged from basically a state of unconsciousness due to their liver failure and realized what was going on and freaked out and panicked and pulled the cannulas out It turned into a big bloody mess that ended with the baboon dying and the patient nearly dying, and that put an end to it That story always stuck with Peter as the depths to which one had to go to try to basically save people during this period of acute liver failure while you either hoped for a recovery and/or found a transplant Any of those stories ever come your way? Not so much the animal portion If you’ve read about accessory livers, you learn a lot about this from living donation: how much liver is required when people are in acute liver failure It’s not something apart from the pediatric population that a small segment of liver could actually solve For accessory livers, you’re implanting a human liver to basically function as a temporary means of metabolism and recovery of immune function and all the other functions that we’ll get to But it’s much more on the human side than cannulas to a baboon, which is a good mimicker We learned a lot about liver disease from alcohol in the baboon This model was one that mimicked human responsiveness more so than other animal models For example, nutrient deprivation that occurs from carbohydrate load from alcohol versus direct injury to the liver The complex and crucial functionality of the liver, its four most essential functions, and more [8:45] The liver is clearly complex enough that in the year 2024, we still do not have a way to approximate it the way we do most other vital organs There’s something about it that’s obviously quite susceptible to injury in the modern environment How would you get people to understand and appreciate the absolute beauty of this what Peter considers a very underappreciated organ? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "When it comes to health, appearances can be deceiving: a lesson from egg boxing",
      "content": "My passion for athletics and competition is no secret; from rucking to archery to motorsports, these pursuits are frequent topics of discussion on the podcast and my social media. But long before I ever engaged in those endeavors, I invented a sport of my own: egg boxing. I first introduced my audience to egg boxing in a demo video I recorded a few years ago, but the concept is fairly simple. Take two raw chicken eggs, knock them side-to-side against each other, and whichever remains uncracked is the winner and goes on to “challenge” other eggs. In other words, no particular athletic skill or strategy required – just a light-hearted game to add some fun to the process of making an omelet. But recently, a listener of The Drive shared with me how she’d turned my offbeat teenage pastime into an educational experiment – one that reminds us to look beyond the superficial when it comes to assessing health. An experiment in egg boxing The listener, Bronwen Holdsworth, graciously agreed to let us share her story and the results of her experiment. It started as any other egg boxing competition, pitting egg against egg in accordance with the rules set out in the video above, and gradually, a champion emerged. Dubbed “MuhammEgg Ali,” the egg went undefeated in 200 boxing matches spanning three months, after which Bronwen shifted toward the primary aim of her experiment: assessing the effects of such repetitive side impacts on egg internal structure. She took MuhammEgg Ali to the Matai Medical Research Institute, where it underwent an MRI scan alongside a fresh, untested control egg. Results: a tragic case of “TYI” Visual inspection confirmed that the shells of both eggs were fully intact at the time of scanning, and MRI revealed the shells to be roughly similar in thickness. Internal structure, however, was discovered to differ dramatically between MuhammEgg Ali and the control egg. Fluid images from the MRI demonstrate that while the fresh egg contained a clearly defined yolk structure surrounded by egg white, the yolk within MuhammEgg Ali appeared to have ruptured and partially mixed with the white, as shown in Figure 1 below. These results (which have also been shared on the Matai Medical Research Institute’s LinkedIn page) reveal a stark discrepancy between the internal state of the boxer egg and its fully intact external structure. Figure 1: MRI revealed substantial internal structural damage resulting from repetitive impacts. Fluid images (with color overlay) show clear separation between egg yolk and egg white in the fresh control egg (left), while the internal contents of the egg boxing champion MuhammEgg Ali (right) have partially mixed. Both eggs were subsequently cracked open and emptied of their fluid contents, which confirmed the findings of the MRI scan. In contrast to the distinct separation between yolk and white from the control egg, the contents of MuhammEgg Ali were scrambled and rotten (Figure 2). Figure 2: Visual inspection of egg contents confirms MRI findings. In contrast to the distinct yolk and white of the control egg, the contents of MuhammEgg Ali are blended and rotten. Importantly, the two eggs were unmatched in age (the control egg was two weeks old while MuhammEgg Ali was three months old), which may have contributed to the observed differences in contents. However, this explanation seems unlikely to account fully for the internal damage to MuhammEgg Ali, as anecdotal data from my own research team would indicate that eggs can retain full separation between yolk and white even after three months, at least under refrigerated conditions. Thus, we conclude that the yolk rupture observed in the boxer egg was due at least in part to its exposure to repeated blunt force impact, and we therefore [posthumously] diagnose MuhammEgg Ali with traumatic yolk injury, or TYI. The importance of looking beyond the surface Of course, humans are very different from chicken eggs, and this experiment was intended primarily to entertain (and perhaps to promote scientific curiosity among Bronwen’s grandchildren, who, along with those at the Matai Institute, assisted her in this project). Yet this story still serves as a reminder of a lesson that applies to humans and eggs alike: appearances can be deceiving where health is concerned. The point may seem obvious, but it is nevertheless often overlooked by both patients and physicians. For instance, many thin individuals fail to monitor their metabolic health because they assume [incorrectly] that a lack of obesity translates to a near-zero percent risk of insulin resistance or liver disease. Physicians may fail to check for or treat atherosclerosis because a patient is in their 30s and runs marathons. An individual with massive biceps may assume body composition analysis is unnecessary and miss the presence of an alarming amount of visceral fat. So in a way, humans have something in common with chicken eggs after all: outer appearances aren’t always all they’re cracked up to be.

      "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter delves into the often misunderstood concept of inflammation. He first defines inflammation and differentiates between acute inflammation and chronic inflammation, the latter of which is linked to aging and a plethora of age-related diseases. Peter breaks down the intricate relationship between chronic inflammation, obesity, and metabolic health, and highlights the signs that might suggest someone may be suffering from chronic inflammation. From there, the conversation centers on actionable advice and practical steps one can take to manage and minimize chronic inflammation. He explores how diet plays a crucial role, including the potential benefits of elimination diets, and he examines the impact of lifestyle factors such as exercise, sleep, and stress management. Additionally, he discusses the relevance of food inflammatory tests and concludes by examining the potential benefits and drawbacks of drugs and supplements in managing inflammation.

Tina the llama getting fed by Napoleon Dynamite. Source: napoleondynamite.fandom.com Defining inflammation Inflammation is just such a buzzword that gets thrown around so much with no meaning it is important that people have a very clear understanding of what we’re talking about and what is often misconstrued in popular circles Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system to defend against some sort of stimulus, usually harmful, but not always, and to eliminate the cause of injury. Inflammation is not always bad—oftentimes, inflammation is essential—it is the fundamental issue for tissue repair for the clearance of infectious pathogens, and obviously, the immune response plays a very important role in that You have the acute inflammatory response (i.e., things get red, things get swollen, things get sore, etc.) That, of course, results from both the infection and also the response of the body But there’s something that is more chronic in its nature, and truthfully that’s really where we’re going to spend our time today If acute inflammation goes unresolved then becomes chronic, then we should talk about that, but again, what we’re here to really talk about today is the maladaptive side of inflammation Acute vs chronic inflammation [8:00] Acute inflammation Anybody who’s had a mosquito bite or who’s cut themself knows what acute inflammation is If you think about a mosquito bite, it’s going to be warm, it’s going to be painful, it’s going to be swollen. You might even have loss of function. This is a very important aspect of healing the insult or inflammation Chronic inflammation What we’re here to talk about is chronic inflammation which can be something that lasts from months into years You don’t tend to have the same physical signs or symptoms, the redness, the swelling, the pain, the obvious things Oftentimes, we think of this as low-grade inflammation It’s often asymptomatic, although there are some examples of maybe where it’s not, for instance, when it’s diet-induced Chronic inflammation is important because of the role that this plays in disease and ultimately in life What do we know about why acute inflammation is a “good” thing but then becomes a bad thing in the context of chronic inflammation after the acute trigger is gone? Acute inflammation is essential to heal the body, so we have an innate immune system that is able to react immediately with soluble antibodies to harmful infectious pathogens example, if you have injury, tissue is damaged, so damaged tissue needs to be cleared All of these things have to happen really, really quickly and very efficiently, and anything that inhibits that process, by the way, is often quite deleterious. People who have shortcomings in their immune system, especially for that type of acute stuff, are going to have significant problems There are, of course, certain disease states that do that. It’s when inflammation becomes more chronic, even after the acute problem has resolved or sometimes when it lingers, that it becomes maladaptive and the balance tips against the organism or the host, which is us A prolonged immune activation can lead to a persistent release of inflammatory cytokines or mediators That can also damage healthy tissue. “Inflammation really becomes chronic once it’s persisted for several months, but it can persist for much longer than that.” —Peter Attia {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Can ovarian cancer be detected by genetic analysis of cervical cancer screening samples?",
      "content": "The best way to reduce the risk of dying from cancer is early detection and diagnosis. For cancers like colon and breast cancers, screening can often detect disease before perceivable symptoms, which often portend advanced cancer and hence a worse prognosis. However, many cancers do not have reliable screening methods, including ovarian cancer, one of the most lethal gynecologic cancers. Even when ovarian cancer becomes symptomatic, the symptoms are nonspecific, which often causes further delays in diagnosis. Indeed, most ovarian cancer is not diagnosed until stage III (when it has invaded the abdominal cavity) or stage IV (when it has become metastatic and spread to distant organs), at which point the five-year survival rate is less than 30%. In contrast, the five-year survival rate for stage I ovarian cancer is above 90%. Clinical trials have tested whether modalities typically used to make ovarian cancer diagnoses (e.g., plasma biomarker cancer antigen 125, either alone or combined with transvaginal ultrasounds) could be used for screening, but these tests were not sufficiently sensitive to early-stage disease.1,2 Since earlier detection is crucial for improving ovarian cancer prognosis, a proof-of-principle study recently explored whether high-grade ovarian cancer could be detected years earlier by analyzing the DNA from cervical cancer screening Papanicolaou (Pap) tests.3 (Brace yourselves – we’re about to dive into some technical details of cancer development and screening test performance metrics. For a little more background in these areas, see AMA #56.) Why might this work? The vast majority of solid tumors originate from the epithelium, the cells that cover the outer surfaces of your organs and line cavities, like the air sacs in your lungs. Epithelial cells have a high turnover rate, resulting in a higher likelihood of mutations that can cause cancer over time. High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is an epithelial cancer that accounts for 75% of all ovarian cancers but does not originate in the ovary. This type of cancer is initiated in the epithelial cells of the fallopian tube as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), and from there, the cancerous cells can travel into the uterine cavity and eventually the cervical canal, potentially allowing them to be detected in cervical cancer screenings. The investigators in this present study used shallow whole-genome sequencing to detect genetic hallmarks of HGSOC. Although most of our cells contain two copies of each gene, occasionally, errors occur during cell division (in non-germline cells) which results in either a gain or loss of large sections of DNA, changing the number of genes, called somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). One mechanism that can cause SCNAs is a failure to properly segregate duplicated chromosomes into two daughter cells during mitosis. This results in aneuploidy, since the gain or loss changes the total number of chromosomes. Aneuploidy and SCNAs in general are rarely found in normal tissues but are common in cancers, especially ovarian cancer, which is why these genetic signatures might be able to facilitate early detection. What the study found This study was a retrospective analysis of 250 archived Pap tests from 113 presymptomatic women with HGSOC at different time points relative to their ovarian cancer diagnosis (some with up to four repeat tests over time), as well as 77 healthy women. The pre-HGSOC women and healthy women were divided into two groups, 62 pre-HGSOC and 52 healthy women were used to train a model and the remaining 51 pre-HGSOC and 25 healthy women were used for subsequent validation. For the women who ultimately developed ovarian cancer, the investigators used purified DNA from both the ovarian tumor (tDNA) following diagnosis and Pap samples (pDNA) collected at or before the time of diagnosis (up to 13.6 years before). The comparison of tDNA to pDNA facilitated working backward from the genetic alterations of the tumor cells to earlier genetic changes, before the onset of symptoms. In the pDNA from pre-ovarian cancer samples, approximately 89% had detectable SCNAs involving the gain or loss of broad chromosomal regions and up to 75% were found to be in regions common with their paired ovarian cancer tumor sample. The samples of tDNA had a high number of genetic alterations across all chromosomes, which was not characteristic of the pDNA samples, indicating that HGSOC acquires many of its mutations during the late stages of tumor development. However, a commonality between pre-symptomatic pDNA and tDNA was a loss of DNA on chromosome 16, which was detected early in pDNA and remained present in the tDNA. This is consistent with previous research reporting that the loss of genetic material on chromosome 16 is an early genomic alteration in ovarian cancers.6 Rather than relying on detecting a common genomic aberration, the investigators used a measure of overall genomic instability, copy number profile abnormality (CPA) score. Based on the training data set, two thresholds were empirically determined using a genome-wide analysis, excluding regions known to have SCNAs in healthy people. A CPA score below the first threshold was considered negative for genomic alterations, and a score above the second threshold was considered positive, reflecting clear detection of aneuploidy. Scores between the two thresholds were regarded as being in a “gray zone” – or an area of uncertainty in which a result would require other follow-up testing to confirm or rule out ovarian cancer. This analysis detected an aneuploid genome (a “positive” result) in the samples of pDNA from up to nine years before cancer diagnosis. Test performance As for all diagnostic tests, it is important to understand what a “positive” or “negative” result actually means. This test had a 75% sensitivity, meaning that, of the pDNA samples from women who will ultimately go on to develop ovarian cancer, 75% were found to have a positive result (above the second threshold). Likewise, this test had a 96% specificity, meaning that 96% of the pDNA samples that had a “negative” result would not go on to develop ovarian cancer. Together, the sensitivity and specificity result in an overall 81% accuracy. For women of average risk (an estimated rate of 9 new ovarian cancers per 100,000 women each year), the negative predictive value of this test is 99.99%, meaning that this test has very few false positives and that if you receive a negative result, it’s unlikely that you have ovarian cancer. However, the positive predictive value is extremely low at 0.5%, meaning that for the most part, in a population without known risk factors, the vast majority of positive results will be false positives that would require further testing to rule out a cancer diagnosis. However, in women with a BRCA1 mutation who are considered high risk (a 40 to 60-fold increased risk of ovarian cancer), the predictive nature of the test changes. In these women, the positive predictive value is 19.7% and the negative predictive value is 99.7%, a more reasonable screening performance to implement when risk is high, though follow-up tests would still be required, as only one in five positive tests would correspond to a true positive case of cancer. So although neither the sensitivity nor the specificity of this test is high enough to warrant routine screening for normal-risk populations, it may nonetheless have utility in high-risk populations if it is tracked over time or if it is stacked with other less specific tests, like liquid biopsy, to either rule out or motivate further diagnostics. What are the limitations? This test used shallow whole-genome sequencing, which has the advantage of being a relatively low-cost way to look for generic variants in samples with many cells. However, the “shallow” methods have a “coverage” that ranges from about 0.5 to 1, meaning that any given portion of the DNA is read only up to one time, as compared to “deep” whole-genome sequencing, which reads each portion of the DNA many times (30 is considered typical for clinical genetic tests). Shallow WGS tends to be more cost-effective and can analyze a larger number of cells but has lower sequencing resolution, which may explain why there was only 75% overlap in the SCNA regions detected in pre-HGSOC and tumor samples. Increasing the sequencing resolution by increasing “depth” would also likely increase the sensitivity of this test by differentiating more of the women in the “gray zone” who would go on to develop cancer from those who would not. Since many of the genetic alterations occurred at around twenty genetic loci – a relatively limited number of positions – future studies will need to investigate whether to interrogate these specific genes with more depth or to maintain the shallow sequencing methods covering the whole genome. In addition to the type of genetic sequencing, this study needs to be replicated in women of matched age groups. Since this was a retrospective study, the samples were not collected for the specific purpose of this type of testing, and there was a difference in the median age of those with ovarian cancer and the healthy controls (60 versus 43 years of age). It is possible that some of the observed genetic alterations could be associated with aging rather than cancer, a limitation of this study that needs to be addressed before translating these methods from proof-of-concept to screening methods tested on a larger population. The bottom line Previous trials that used modalities typically used to make ovarian cancer diagnoses have failed to reduce ovarian cancer mortality because the methods of detection were not sensitive enough to early-stage disease.1,2 By contrast, the genomic analyses employed in this study were able to detect cancerous changes nearly a decade before diagnosis – an enormous advantage in combating a disease for which the five-year survival rate at stage I is over three times higher than the survival rate at stage IV. Since the DNA analysis can be done on samples that are already routinely collected for cervical cancer screening, this may be a feasible way to add ovarian cancer screening to the current standard of care in populations most vulnerable to this type of cancer. While the test, as it currently stands, is far too susceptible to false positives to justify use in the general female population of average ovarian cancer risk, its use as a screening method for women with especially high baseline risk has the potential to improve clinical outcomes associated with this disease.

      "title": "Body composition: impact on disease risk and how to assess and improve it",
      "content": "Countless different metrics are used to assess metabolic health. Body mass index (BMI) – the mass of the body divided by height squared – is among the simplest and most commonly used, but while BMI may provide a fair indication of overall trends in metabolic health across a given population, it falls short for assessing the metabolic health of any given individual. I often joke that at the individual level, it tells me little more about one of my patients’ health than their eye color! The reason for this failure is that BMI does not take into account how mass is distributed between fat mass and lean mass, which have largely opposing effects on metabolic health. In other words, BMI provides no information about body composition, a set of variables with far more relevance to health and mortality than body weight or BMI alone. The importance of body composition for healthspan and lifespan cannot be overstated, which is why it is a subject that repeatedly comes up in our content (e.g., see AMA 17, AMA 40, and AMA 44). So given its importance, how do we know where we stand with respect to body composition? What are the best ways of assessing body composition, and what are their respective limitations? Which metrics in particular are most predictive of healthspan and lifespan, and what are the ideal values we should be aiming for within each? We will devote the rest of this piece to exploring these key questions in depth. Would you like to read the full article?This content is an exclusive benefit to premium members.

      "content": "In this special edition celebrating 300 episodes of The Drive, Peter discusses a variety of popular topics and health interventions and classifies them based on their level of evidence and relevance using the following categories: proven, promising, fuzzy, noise, and nonsense. Peter first delves into the topic of geroprotective molecules, covering rapamycin, metformin, NAD and its precursors, and resveratrol. Next, he explores the significance of metrics like VO2 max and muscle mass, as well as emerging concepts like blood flow restriction and stem cells. The conversation extends to nutrition, addressing questions surrounding long-term fasting, sugar consumption, sugar substitutes, and the contentious role of red meat in cancer. Peter not only provides his current stance on each topic—most of which have been covered in great detail in the previous 300 episodes—but also reflects on how his opinion may have evolved over the years.

Peter asks, “Was it 7 years ago or 6 years ago?” It launched in June 2018, but we were recording previous because the original episodes were part of Peter’s research for his book So we started having some of these discussions in 2017 Peter never really thought about it To him it was binary We started it as a 12-part series and thought it was going to be either uninteresting/ unhelpful/useless (in which it dies) or it was going to be potentially interesting/ valuable (and we keep doing it) Once we hit that binary spot after 3 months and decided to keep doing it, he never really thought of the milestones What we like to do for every hundred episodes is do a special episode, something a little different, and release it to everybody It’s shot as an AMA, but just a little bit of a different style When we were thinking of how we wanted to do this one, we thought of a recent interview Peter did, which was structured in a way we liked He gave his opinion on various drugs, supplements, behaviors, interventions, and put them in the following categories: proven, promising, fuzzy, noise, nonsense We thought it was a cool way to go through and talk about some of these different things in a little detail and categorize them so people could understand how he thinks about them, how he applies them to his life and his patients A lot of these topics, are things that we’ve covered in various podcasts, newsletters, and we’ll link to those [see the selected links section at the end] The goal here isn’t to be super in depth, go through all these studies, all this background research We’ll link to those in the show notes for anyone who is interested This is going to be more of a conversation where a patient comes to Peter and asks about something We use the terms “proven, promising, fuzzy, noise, and nonsense” as heuristics, but what does Peter really mean by those things? To be clear (and people have heard him say this before): in biology there is no such thing as proof This is not physics or mathematics or even physics In biology it’s all probability When we say “proven”, what we’re really saying is what we’re talking about has such well-established data that the probability that it is untrue is so small that it would be foolish to not act on it Conversely, “promising” says the claim looks really good There are a lot of data supporting it, but there’s something that’s missing from a data perspective Either there isn’t just quite enough human data or there just isn’t quite enough RCT data or there’s some slight thing that’s missing that would keep you from saying, this is effectively proven “Fuzzy” is shorthand for there are some data around this claim, but they might be the best data The data might be inconsistent, they might be contradictory Not just one study is contradicting another study, but it’s like there’s real contradictions here and therefore we clearly need to do more before we could elevate this “Noise” is an interesting category, and it largely says that the data out there today are not of sufficient quality to make a judgment, but there might be something compelling that could move this in the other direction For example, there might be very compelling mechanistic data There might be a very compelling biochemical story around an idea, but the data have just been too small, too incomplete, to even elevate it up to fuzzy And by the way, noise can quickly turn into nonsense when you shine enough light on it “Nonsense” basically says, “No, actually this has been studied and it’s bunk.” We really have a high degree of confidence in saying that there is nothing there that should be paid attention to And that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s harmful, but it means that this is not doing what people say it is doing All of that takes a long time to explain, so Peter doesn’t want to have to explain it every time, but he thinks explaining it upfront hopefully gives people a sense of where we are With each example, we’ll provide enough detail to rationalize that position (hopefully) The beauty of science is that as new evidence comes out, Peter is happy to change his opinion on what he thinks about things Let’s say we do this in another hundred episodes, then what we’re going to talk about with new evidence can easily move up or down the chain So it’s not like this is how it is and this is how it will be And if we did this a hundred episodes ago, Peter can even look at this list and tell you things he would’ve said different 100 episodes ago He would be foolish to suggest that 100 episodes from now, if we come back and revisit this list, he would have the exact same things to say about it That’s very unlikely Rapamycin [9:30] This includes rapamycin, metformin, NAD, and resveratrol Peter’s definition of a geroprotective drug and how he thinks about that Geroprotection really talks more broadly about mechanisms that target hallmarks of aging A geroprotective drug would be a drug or a molecule that you’re taking not because it necessarily provides benefit in 1 arena against 1 chronic disease or 1 symptom, but rather because you believe it is fundamentally altering the biology of aging And as such, taking this drug moves things in your favor, and that should mean that you would live longer taking this drug That’s a very high bar There are lots of drugs that are really effective at doing things that wouldn’t quite rise to the level of being geroprotective What category do you put rapamycin in? Peter puts rapamycin in the promising category, but clearly it’s not proven We’ve covered rapamycin so much in other podcasts, and this podcast is in no way meant to displace or be a substitute for those things [see the selected links section at the end] At a high level, rapamycin is a substance that was discovered from a bacteria discovered on Easter Island in the mid-sixties The bacteria was Streptomyces hygroscopicus, which at the time was a very novel organism that had never been discovered anywhere else And it secreted this chemical that was named rapamycin to honor the island where it was discovered, Rapa Nui This molecule was found to be a very potent antifungal and made it a very logical choice for a bacteria to have evolved to produce it Bacteria is trying to fight a fungi by inhibiting them through this molecule The first thought was, “Hey, this might be the next cure for athlete’s foot.” That drug, which almost died a thousand deaths due to lack of interest, finally was championed through a guy named Suren Sehgal (who has since passed away) Suren single-handedly figured out utility for this drug that ultimately put it on the map as a drug with clinical application in organ transplantation as an immune suppressant In 1999, the FDA approves this drug for solid organ transplantation, and it spends the next decade in relative obscurity When Peter was in his residency, rapamycin was used amongst a cocktail of other drugs for patients who had received heart transplants, kidney transplants, and liver transplants Fast-forward to 2009, and a very well-done study is published as part of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) that looked at the use of rapamycin in a very well-documented strain of mice that are far more representative of what happens in biology than the typical strain of mice that are used in a clinical research setting That study showed more convincingly than any other study in the ITP history that rapamycin extended life in male mice, in female mice, and most importantly, when initiated very late in life (a period of time in which no other drug had ever been able to extend life) This was replicated many, many times in the ITP and elsewhere It was also replicated in other model systems, meaning it wasn’t just replicated again in mammals {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "With exercise, results matter more than “time served”",
      "content": "“How much time do I need to spend exercising?” It’s a question I hear often, and it is the subject of countless research studies and popular press articles. And yet, this question misses the point. When it comes to exercise, we should only concern ourselves with duration insofar as it influences what we really care about: results. Exercise is not a goal in itself – rather, it is a means of achieving good cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and metabolic health, and the ultimate indicators of sufficient exercise are therefore a good VO2 max and adequate muscle mass. Why do we care about VO2 max and muscle mass? The rationale for emphasizing VO2 max and muscle mass is simple: these are the metrics with the greatest implications for healthspan and lifespan. VO2 max, a measure of the body’s maximal ability to utilize oxygen during intense exercise, is indicative of overall cardiorespiratory fitness and, as discussed in detail in a recent premium newsletter, has been shown in multiple large-scale studies to be strongly and inversely associated with all-cause mortality risk across all adult age groups. Indeed, a low VO2 max is reported to be a far better predictor of mortality than diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or even age¹. The strength of this association can in large part be attributed to the fact that, in contrast to many other performance metrics, a high VO2 max requires consistency in training over relatively long spans of time and reflects not only aerobic fitness but body composition as well, underscoring the importance of maintaining this metric at a high level throughout life. In addition to VO2 max, muscle mass – and to a greater extent, muscle strength – is also inversely correlated with mortality. As explained in AMA #27, low muscle mass (meeting clinical definitions of sarcopenia) has been reported to be associated with a 60% increase in risk of mortality relative to the absence of sarcopenia². Inadequate muscle leads to metabolic dysfunction and frailty, both of which can limit both quality and duration of life, but unfortunately, gradual losses of muscle mass and muscle strength are features of the aging process that cannot fully be avoided. Therefore, the most effective strategy for preventing sarcopenia in our latter decades of life is to build and maintain as much muscle as possible leading up to (and including) those decades – in other words, to ensure that we have enough muscle to buffer against the inevitable losses over time. Focus on outputs over inputs Many research studies claim to identify an “optimal” amount of time to devote to exercise each day or week in order to maximize health and lifespan benefits, but in the short video below, I explain why these results can be deceiving – and why focusing on outcomes of exercise, i.e., VO2 max and muscle mass, is a better strategy for setting goals around exercise and determining what is or isn’t “enough.” <iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iGzEB3Ka39o?si=YrjVVkYLkG2zCJOf\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe> If the goal for exercise is to improve health and extend lifespan, then the metrics that matter are those most closely related to health and lifespan – i.e., VO2 max and muscle strength. Exercise duration is another step removed from that aim and is only one of the various “inputs” – along with exercise intensity and consistency over time, for instance – that impact the more relevant “outputs” of cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle mass. While setting goals for exercise duration may be valuable for some as a means of keeping oneself accountable on a day-to-day level, it’s critical to keep in mind that such short-term “goals” are merely stepping stones in a longer path; they are not ends in themselves. And to keep our eyes on that ultimate end of a longer, healthier life, we must focus instead on metrics that are indicative of how exercise is affecting our overall fitness and strength.

      "title": "Does the timing of sleep loss during the night impact subsequent negative metabolic effects?",
      "content": "Chronic sleep loss is associated with many disease states (see Episode #47 of The Drive with Dr. Matthew Walker) and is an increasingly pervasive problem, with 1 in 3 US adults¹ reportedly getting inadequate sleep every night. Even a single night of altered sleep can lead to insulin resistance² in healthy individuals and can disrupt satiety hormone signaling³, which may contribute to poor metabolic health in the long term through altered eating patterns. However, when sleep loss is unavoidable, are there ways to minimize the damage by adjusting the timing of sleep loss (i.e., which specific hours of sleep are lost)? To shed light on this question, a recent study investigated whether the metabolic impact of sleep loss differed when one loses sleep in the first half of the night versus the latter half. Study design This randomized, crossover study assessed the impact of sleep loss timing on hunger and appetite-regulating hormones among fifteen healthy, normal weight, young males (mean age=24.6 years, mean BMI=23.3). (Note that women are very often excluded from small trials such as this in order to avoid the possibility that menstrual cycles might impact results, so it’s important to keep in mind that findings might therefore only be applicable to men.) In addition to ensuring all participants were in good metabolic health, the investigators also excluded individuals on the basis of variables known to impact sleep, such as consumption of >50 g alcohol per day or >300 mg caffeine per day, shift work, recent travel between time zones, and habitual sleep <6 hours per day. All fifteen participants underwent three different sleep conditions, conducted 3-5 weeks apart in a random order for each subject: (i) late night sleep loss (sleep from 22:30-03:00 and awake the rest of the night), (ii) early night sleep loss (awake until 02:15 and sleep from 02:15-06:45), and (iii) regular sleep (sleep from 22:15-06:45). On each experimental night, subjects were given a standardized 380-kcal meal at 20:15 and afterwards were only allowed to drink water until 11:00 the following day. In the sleep loss conditions, participants remained awake in a sitting position and were permitted to read and watch non-arousing movies during wake time. Blood samples were taken to assess circulating concentrations of ghrelin and leptin – hormones which signal hunger and satiety, respectively – at regular intervals during wake and sleep time (20:00, 21:00, and 22:00 during the night waking period, every 2 hours from 00:00, to 06:00, and each hour from 07:00 to 11:00 during the morning waking period). Hunger, desire to eat, and appetite data were assessed using a self-report scale (each ranked from 0-10) at 60-minute intervals during awake periods. Late night sleep loss initially appears worse for hormones and hunger… The authors observed that though leptin levels did not differ between conditions, plasma ghrelin was significantly altered depending on the sleep condition. Specifically, sleep onset increased ghrelin in the conditions where participants started their sleep early, but did not spike during the early night sleep loss condition. Further, the morning blood collection data revealed that at 08:00, 10:00, and 11:00, ghrelin concentrations were elevated in the late-night sleep loss condition, but not the early-night sleep loss or regular sleep comparisons, and pairwise comparisons revealed that ghrelin in the late-night sleep loss condition was statistically significantly elevated compared to the early-night sleep loss condition. Regarding the self-reported data, the authors observed that feelings of hunger, desire to eat, and appetite were increased in the morning after late night sleep loss versus regular sleep and early night sleep loss conditions (at 07:00 and 08:00). However, by the middle-end of the morning observation period (09:00, 10:00, and 11:00), feelings of hunger, desire to eat, and appetite had largely converged, and were no longer significantly different between conditions (though appetite was slightly lower in the regular sleep group at 11:00). …But closer examination reveals significant issues that invalidate the conclusions Though the crossover design allows a greater degree of confidence that confounders are not influencing the findings of this study, several outstanding issues still undermine the validity of the conclusion that late night sleep loss is most detrimental to hunger and appetite regulation. Though ghrelin was elevated in those with late night sleep loss, the statistical comparison that achieved significance was between late night and early night sleep loss. Next-day ghrelin levels were not statistically different between late night sleep loss and regular sleep. We know that sleep loss is detrimental to health, so why would regular sleep not be better than both sleep loss conditions, and particularly the condition that appears to significantly increase hunger? Indeed, ghrelin levels in the regular sleep condition trended slightly (albeit non-significantly) higher than the early night sleep loss condition. These data would suggest that the best option for controlling hunger would be to get just 4.5 hours of sleep per night, starting around 2:00. Since we know this conclusion is categorically untrue, we must assume that these results are attributable to either unreported methodological issues or to the possibility that ghrelin may not be driving the differences in hunger/appetite regulation after sleep loss. The latter conclusion is further supported by the fact that the self-reported data do not reflect ghrelin observations. No groups differed significantly in hunger or desire to eat after 09:00 (at either 10:00 or 11:00). This seems contrary to their results that ghrelin was consistently elevated in the late night sleep loss group through the entire observation period. Ghrelin is far from the only hormone regulating appetite, and we know self-reported data have limited reliability, but if participants were equivalently hungry and had similar desires to eat regardless of the sleep pattern, can we really draw any conclusions about the real-world significance of a short-term difference in ghrelin levels? If the hormone differences do not translate into eating differences (something we cannot know since participants did not have access to food, but we might infer based on the self-report data), it’s hard to argue that this result has any relevance to metabolic health. Additionally, although the authors collected blood samples at regular intervals throughout the night, they only report data from the morning following each sleep condition (07:00-11:00). What do leptin and ghrelin values look like throughout the night? These results might give us a much better picture about how the timing of sleep disruption impacts hormonal regulation of hunger/satiety, and their conspicuous absence in the manuscript raises the possibility that the investigators cherry-picked data in order to draw clearer conclusions. For example, if ghrelin changes observed during waking periods in the early night sleep loss condition were similarly elevated, we might conclude that ghrelin fluctuations are, in sum, equivalent between early night and late night sleep loss, and perhaps a full night’s sleep would be found to be better than both sleep loss conditions. In that case, we would conclude that any sleep loss changes satiety signaling and may in turn drive eating behavior in uncontrolled conditions, regardless of when sleep is disrupted. Alternatively, the overnight ghrelin measurements might reveal more about the impact of meal timing relative to sleep on hunger and satiety. The only meal provided during each observation period was given at the same time (20:15), regardless of the sleep condition. Being awake for 6 hours after your last meal, compared to 2 hours, is likely to alter the release of hunger and satiety-related hormones. Further, release of these hormones is known to follow circadian rhythms, and it certainly wouldn’t be surprising if forcing someone to go without food for 9 hours after waking would correspond to greater hunger hormone signaling than going without food for 4 hours after waking. (When was the last time you ate breakfast ≥9 hours after getting out of bed??) This might explain, for instance, why no difference was observed between the early sleep loss and regular sleep groups. The bottom line We can’t really be sure about anything new regarding how the timing of sleep loss impacts hunger and satiety hormones based on this study. Despite a seemingly strong randomized, crossover design, it’s likely that the investigators simply didn’t examine enough metrics and didn’t cover (or report) on a long enough period of time through the day to draw any firm conclusions. However, one thing we can say for certain (based on a large body of evidence) is that good sleep, or sleep that is long enough and consistently timed, is important for health, and we should all continue to practice it as such. (For more information on improving your sleep, Episode #221 of The Drive provides an extensive summary of sleep optimization techniques.) If you must limit sleep duration for any reason, the best strategy for minimizing damage to health is to ensure maximal sleep quality during the limited time that you have – not trying to choose between early versus late night sleep loss.

      "content": "Luc van Loon is an internationally renowned expert in skeletal muscle metabolism. In this episode, Luc starts with an exploration of the roles of insulin and triglycerides in endurance exercise, highlighting their impact on skeletal muscle metabolism, and he offers profound insights into the significance of protein in this context. He elucidates how different protein types and forms influence muscle protein synthesis rates, exploring the nuances of protein absorption, digestibility, amino acid quality, and their implications for performance and recovery.

No, that’s correct Luc’s main interest in the beginning and also in his PhD was in fuel selection Substrate selection during exercise, and most of that stuff is done during endurance-type exercise And if you’re thinking about substrates, you’re not thinking about protein, which is from a quantitative point of view is not a very good substrate Instead, it’s carbohydrate and fat metabolism The most interesting thing for him at that time was that they had set up a stabilizer dope research facility where you could track metabolites The first things that that lab did is actually measure carbohydrate oxidation rates You would simply throw in some stable isotope labeled carbohydrates in your drink and simply by the oxidation of those carbohydrates, you would exhale 13CO2 If it’s labeled with 13C, you get 13CO2 after you oxidize it And by simply acquiring your expired breath, you can calculate how much of your energy came from a sports drink Luc explains, “That was so cool for me at that time.” Just to be clear, you would also need to know the amount of oxygen consumption to be sure that that CO2 came from glucose and not from fat, correct? Yeah, it’s a combination of indirect telemetry, so that’s total oxygen uptake and total carbon dioxide production, combined gives you total energy expenditure and also total oxidation of carbohydrates and fats Then, because you know what percentage of the carbohydrates derived CO2 was expired by 13CO2, you could calculate back how much of the carbohydrate is coming from your drink That is cool, because then you’ll see how much of the drink are you actually using Peter mentions a method that uses deuterated water in C-13 (doubly labeled water) to measure energy expenditure in a free living environment over a long period of time Is the method you are referring to only using labeled carbon and therefore only suitable for a short period of time to evaluate glucose oxidation, or do you also label oxygen and potentially get energy expenditure over a long period of time? If you use doubly labeled water, you need several days to do that You’re getting carbohydrates in, you start oxidizing them, that CO2 is also mixed in your blood It takes a while before the expiration of labeled carboy is a good proxy for the amount of carbohydrates that you’re oxidizing In 2 hours, they’re in a nice steady state That’s why he’s measuring oxidation rate at 1-2 hours for endurance athletes That’s only for exercise trials Peter asks, “Did this tend to be more accurate than the estimate you would get of carbohydrate oxidation rate just using the indirect calorimetry and the Weir equation? Or was the point here to determine not total carbohydrate metabolism, but specifically how much is coming from the drink?” Exactly, you can see how much of that carbohydrate is coming from your drink (versus glycogen) You have your glycogen coming from your liver, you have your glycogen coming from your muscle, you can actually detect that with an intravenous glucose tracer with a different label, and then you have your 13C label in your drink, so you can actually see all 3 substrates You can see what is coming from the drink, what is coming from your muscle glycogen, and what is total coming from your plasma glucose Plasma glucose includes the drink, but you can subtract that from the total That was not enough for Luc, he also wanted to know what fatty acids are being used from your intramuscular triglycerides (the fat inside your muscle fibers) and what is come actually from the fat tissue that is releasing fatty acids and then transported to the circulation and taken up in the muscle Because that is also an important topic for athletes, and also diabetes patients Fuel utilization during endurance exercise [9:30] Peter is preparing for a long endurance event An event that’s going to take about 20 hours It’s been so long since he’s thought about how to prepare energetically for something like this Peter believes that nutrition can make or break you in these 20-hour marathon events What did you learn about the rate of carbohydrate metabolism, muscle glycogen, liver glycogen in the steady state? One of the most important things is that all the glucose that is coming into circulation will be used for oxidation during exercise It’s a good idea to have a continuous supply of glucose coming from your gut To keep your liver glycogen intact, or at least not to deplete too fast You want to maximize your liver glycogen We know that glucose polymers are oxidized at a rate of 1.0-1.1 grams per minute About 60-70 grams per hour However it can be a little bit higher if you add some fructose Because fructose requires a different transporter So if you combine glucose with fructose, you can get a little bit higher, but that’s only for the high-end athletes that can actually gain that high energy expenditure Then you go up to maybe 1.3-1.4 grams per minute {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "content": "There are few concepts in the longevity space that inspire my disdain more than the b-word: biohacking – the notion that individuals can enhance health, performance, and lifespan by adopting an array of experimental, esoteric, and often expensive interventions, from over-the-counter supplements and “DNA diets” to young blood transfusions and implanted computer chips or magnets. The very term “biohacking” feels to me like an affront to those of us who strive to help others achieve meaningful improvements in health and quality of life. It seems to imply the existence of shortcuts to health and longevity, such that those who are in-the-know and have sufficient disposable income might circumvent the need for consistent adherence to tried-and-true approaches like exercise, nutrition, and good sleep. And yet, much to my chagrin, the popularity of this concept persists. Though I despise the thought of biohacking being associated with my work, I’m asked about it often, so I’d like to take a moment to make my thoughts on this subject as clear as possible. In this short video, I share the reasoning behind my belief that biohacking sends the wrong messages about the pursuit of a longer, healthier life, distracting from the interventions and lifestyle approaches that really matter for achieving that ultimate goal. <iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtYE-XV1bO0?si=S1jrrdr3WRFmwBdK\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe> For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama",

It’s just a question of focus, and when you focus more of your energy on healthspan, you’re getting a lot of those lifespan benefits for free You can clearly do a lot of the one-off stuff that is purely lifespan related (like managing your apoB and cancer screening and things like that) But it’s this focus on cognitive health and physical health that get you so much of that lifespan benefit, and of course you’re enjoying the quality of your life Those 2 decline quite predictably, and so really what we’re trying to do is we age is delay the rate of decline There’s this 3rd component of healthspan, which is emotional health, which is what obviously we’re going to speak about in great detail What Peter tells people (and what he tells himself when he’s feeling a little depressed about aging) is that the thing we have going for us is that is the 1 thing that doesn’t have to get worse with age Everything else gets worse with age You can do quite a bit to mitigate that and reduce the magnitude of the negative derivative, but you’re not making it a positive derivative But this doesn’t have to be true for emotional health In your experience working with people, do you see that people generally become happier and more satisfied as they age? How deliberate does one need to be about emotional health to ensure that you can be on an increasing curve of emotional health as you age? Unfortunately, emotional health often declines as people get older That is sort of the rule, but it doesn’t have to be Emotional health can improve throughout the lifespan, but there’s so many things that we have to be aware of Does it take intention? Yes We have to really think about how we take care of ourselves How is your emotional health setting the climate for your physical health, your cognitive health, for your happiness? Very often we get swept up in this idea that, “Oh, time is passing and we’re getting older. Isn’t that bad?” There’s a whole set of societal standards that bias us away from good emotional health as we get older This idea that “It’s sad that we lament getting older and we talk about how fast times is going”, because that’s really a societal construct “It’s a social construct that we can change… if we’re actively taking care of ourselves.”‒ Paul Conti Taking care of ourselves means taking care of our bodies so we can remain active Remaining interested in new things ‒ learning Keeping an expansive mindset that if we’re doing this, we’re setting a climate inside of us that is conducive to all these other good things to healthspan, lifespan, cognitive health So often we say that we’re trying to do that, but we’re ignoring the climate that we’re living in And we have much more control over that Part of the message of healthspan and lifespan is attend to our emotional health and take it seriously because we’re living in it day in, day out We’ve got to step back from our lives often and look at what we are presuming Are we thinking, “Oh, it’s just bad to get older and the jokes and all the dialogue within us is negative” Or, can we feel good about getting older that we have achievements under our belt And have learning and wisdom that we didn’t have before And continue to stay curious and active and get happier and healthier across the lifespan There’s a demographic of people for whom that’s absolutely true, and it’s wonderful to witness them They’re very, very different than people who are not like that People that are still bright-eyed, engaged in the world as they age And that doesn’t happen by accident The impact of emotional health on healthspan and how to foster a proactive approach to emotional well-being [7:00] When someone asks Peter to explain what the cognitive component of healthspan is, we can talk about executive function, we can talk about processing speed, we can talk about recall memory Of course, you can drill down further and further and further into these things and you can start to paint a pretty comprehensive picture of what cognitive health involves You can also do that cognizant of the changes that occur Arthur Brooks has written quite eloquently about the transition from fluid intelligence to crystallized intelligence [In the book From Strength to Strength, and discussed in episode #226] While our fluid intelligence peaked when Peter and Paul met each other (and in that regard they’ve only become stupider), they’ve gained other intelligence (this crystallized intelligence) that’s more experiential and more about pattern recognition While we might not have the processing speed we once did, we’re intelligent in a different way {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Silencing the alarm over a recent paper on dietary protein and atherosclerosis",
      "content": "The importance of dietary protein is a recurring theme in these newsletters and on The Drive podcast. So imagine the flood of emails, phone calls, and questions I received last month following the publication and press coverage of a recent study1 reporting that high protein intake, via activation of mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1), drives atherosclerosis development and progression. But as we’ve so often seen in the past, media attention is no guarantee that flashy claims are supported by good science. As we’ve discussed in detail in previous content, the increases in circulating levels of amino acids (AAs) following intake of dietary protein are certainly known to stimulate mTORC1 (and its core component, mTOR), but how might this effect then lead to atherosclerosis? And how convincingly do the results of this new study substantiate such a link? About the study The recent study by Zhang et al. involved experiments across a range of test systems – including human participants, mouse models, and cultured cells. For human trials, subjects with BMIs in the overweight range were divided to participate in one of two crossover studies. Study 1 (n=14) compared responses to a 500-kcal low-protein liquid meal (LP; 10% of total energy from protein, 17% from fat, and 73% from carbohydrates) and an isocaloric very high-protein liquid meal (VHP; 50% energy from protein, 17% from fat, and 33% from carbohydrates), while Study 2 (n=9) compared a 450-kcal standard-protein mixed meal (15% of total energy from protein, 35% from fat, and 50% from carbohydrates) and an isocaloric mixed meal more typical of human “high-protein” diets (22% energy from protein, 30% from fat, and 48% from carbohydrates). For both studies, participants each completed both test meals in random order, with approximately 1–2 weeks separating the two tests. Following an overnight fast and immediately prior to consuming the test meals, participants underwent a baseline blood draw in order to permit assessment of plasma AA concentrations and isolation of circulating immune cells (monocytes). For Study 1, participants were given five minutes following the baseline blood draw to consume the test meal, and further blood samples were collected one and three hours post-meal. For Study 2, which involved “real food” meals (containing homogenized beans, vegetables, bacon, eggs, etc), participants were instructed to consume the meal within 30 minutes following baseline blood draws, and further blood samples were collected one and two hours after meal initiation. In addition to quantification of AA concentrations, blood samples were assayed for indicators of mTORC1 activation and autophagy in circulating monocytes. What they found Results showed that consumption of greater amounts of protein led to a greater influx of amino acids into circulation and greater activation of mTORC1. Total AA concentrations in plasma increased after consuming the VHP meal (but not the LP meal) in Study 1, as well as after the HP meal (but not the SP meal) in Study 2. Markers of mTORC1 activation in circulating monocytes increased in a dose-dependent manner, with the most dramatic increases observed after the VHP meal, followed by the HP meal. Modest increases were observed after the SP meal, and no significant elevations were observed after the LP meal. Both higher-protein meals were also associated with decreased markers of autophagy relative to baseline and to lower-protein meals. In investigating postprandial plasma concentrations of specific AAs, seven AAs were found to be elevated after both the very-high-protein liquid meal and the high-protein mixed meal: leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, threonine, serine and arginine. The authors therefore sought to determine which of these AAs contribute to mTORC1 activation. By treating cultured monocyte-derived macrophages variously with these different AAs, they found that leucine was the primary activator of mTORC1, and activation in response to elevated leucine concentrations occurred in a dose-dependent manner above an apparent threshold between 100-300 μM. Bridging results to atherosclerosis The obvious question at this point is, “what does any of this have to do with heart disease?” To develop this part of their story, Zhang et al. turned to a mouse model of atherosclerosis in which the animals lack apolipoprotein E (a model known as apoE-/- mice). These mice were separated into one of three western diets (roughly equivalent in energy density) for eight weeks: low-protein (7% kcal from protein, 51% carbohydrates, and 42% fat), moderate-protein (21% kcal from protein, 36% carbohydrates, and 42% fat), or high-protein (46% kcal from protein, 11% carbohydrates, and 43% fat). (Due to differences in total food intake, the authors argue that these diets corresponded to human diets of ~15% and 22% protein for moderate- and high-protein mouse diets, respectively). As we will discuss in an upcoming AMA, varying a diet’s protein content impacts total energy consumption, as protein tends to be more satiating than other macronutrients. Thus, the authors found that animals across the different diet groups consumed different amounts of total calories. Low-, moderate-, and high-protein groups consumed an average of about 5.7 g, 4.8 g, and 3.3 g of total food per day, respectively, corresponding to an average protein consumption of 0.4 g, 1.0 g, and 1.5 g per day, respectively. Consistent with these discrepancies in total calorie intake, body weights following the 8-week diet intervention were likewise inversely correlated with protein content, with the animals on the low-protein diet exhibiting the greatest amount of weight gain and animals on the high-protein diet exhibiting the least weight gain. The divergence in body weight was attributable specifically to differences in fat mass, as the three groups did not differ significantly in lean mass. Yet despite the trends in fat mass, animals on the high-protein diet – but not moderate-protein diet – were found to have increased atherosclerotic plaque burden in the aortic root relative to low-protein animals at the end of the 8-week study. Based on these findings, Zhang et al. argue that the increased activation of mTORC1 associated with high dietary protein consumption drives atherosclerosis. Further, by conducting follow-up experiments in which the moderate-protein diet was adjusted to high-protein levels by fortifying with i) leucine, ii) all AAs except leucine, or iii) all AAs, the researchers found that high intake of leucine in particular is necessary and sufficient for promoting the atherogenic effects of protein. A bridge too far Based on all of the results described above, the authors state that they have “uncovered a mechanism by which high protein intake, through an increase in plasma leucine, causes mTORC1-mediated inhibition of monocyte/macrophage autophagy and subsequent atherogenesis.” As we’ve seen, mouse experiments form the critical bridge linking protein intake to atherosclerosis, which in turn has naturally been the focus of media coverage related to the study. So how well does this link stand up to scrutiny? Let’s just say that if I had to compare it to a more literal bridge, the Tacoma Narrows might be the first to come to mind. Mice are a notoriously terrible model for studying human heart disease, as their lipid metabolism pathways differ from those of humans and they do not spontaneously develop atherosclerosis on normal diets. Zhang et al. sought to work around this problem by using the atherosclerosis-prone apoE-/- mouse model, but making mice more susceptible to atherosclerosis requires genetic manipulations which may have myriad off-target effects, making it difficult to translate results to humans. ApoE-/- mice, for instance, were initially developed based on the logic that knockout of apoE would reduce hepatic clearance of LDL, thus mimicking humans with high LDL. But apoE has also been shown to combat atherosclerosis through antioxidative, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory actions, and knocking out this gene would impair these pathways as well as LDL clearance. Given the widespread cellular effects of mTORC1, the impact of losing these alternative anti-atherogenic pathways could certainly be modulated by protein intake in such a way that would appear to favor low-protein diets, but the atherosclerotic plaques developed in this way would still be a result of pathways that are completely irrelevant to humans or other genetically normal animals. (As a simple example for illustration, let’s say that apoE plays a role in suppressing pro-inflammatory signals induced by mTORC1 activation. In apoE-/- mice, this suppression is lost, so more protein → more mTORC1 activation → more inflammation, but in humans or mice with functional apoE, protein-induced mTORC1 activation is blocked from triggering rampant inflammation.) So what can we learn from this study? Let’s recap. 1) In the couple of hours following a high-protein meal, humans exhibit elevated levels of circulating amino acids. 2) The elevation in amino acid concentration is associated with increased mTORC1 activation and decreased autophagy among circulating monocytes. 3) Leucine is primarily responsible for these effects, which take place when plasma leucine reaches a threshold concentration of 100-300 μM. 4) Atherosclerosis-prone mice demonstrate a greater atherosclerotic plaque burden after eight weeks on a high-protein (or high-leucine) western diet than on a low-protein western diet. We’ve just seen that the atherosclerosis results leave plenty to be desired with respect to their relevance to humans, so what else can we take away from this study? We already knew that protein (and leucine in particular) stimulates mTORC1 signaling and that there is a threshold over which this effect takes place. This is a good thing! This is why, for example, protein consumption by itself can stimulate muscle protein synthesis (though not as much as exercise and protein consumption combined). The present study adds that the mTORC1 effect can be observed specifically in immune cells (monocytes) – whereas it has previously been studied primarily in muscle tissue – yet the implications of this mTORC1 activation for health and longevity remain unclear. The mTOR-activating effects of dietary protein are relatively acute. In this study, data from the human SP group indicate that mTORC1 activity diminished by two hours after meal initiation. This is substantially less time than a typical gap between meals for the average person, leaving plenty of time for mTOR signaling to return to baseline even after a higher-protein meal. In other words, the activation of mTOR induced by dietary protein is not constant, and while chronic suppression of mTOR (e.g., via rapamycin) has been shown to increase lifespan in various species, we currently have no evidence that suppressing or avoiding short, postprandial spikes would similarly extend lifespan (or that it wouldn’t have the opposite effect). Additionally, it’s noteworthy that this study was specifically conducted in untrained participants, as exclusion criteria included engaging in structured exercise for >90 min/week. However, as discussed in a soon-to-be-released episode of The Drive with Dr. Luc van Loon, responses to dietary protein differ between trained and untrained individuals. In the former, dietary protein appears to be more preferentially directed toward muscle, perhaps reducing the impact on mTORC1 signaling in immune cells. The bottom line I’ve often repeated that adequate dietary protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle mass, which in turn is essential for maintaining physical function and avoiding frailty. Yet despite the wealth of evidence underlying that recommendation, it seems that every few months, a new research report sets off alarms with respect to dietary protein and negative consequences for health. Invariably, closer inspection of these studies reveals that the terror-inducing conclusions are based on inappropriate methods and/or logical gymnastics between unrelated findings. The present study by Zhang et al. unfortunately falls into both traps. Yes, it provides a few nuggets of value regarding protein effects on circulating monocytes and cellular signaling. But rather than fully characterizing these effects by, for example, monitoring them over a longer time course or repeating experiments in trained participants, the investigators chose to draw dubious connections to the headline-grabbing topic of heart disease by employing a heavily flawed model with limited relevance to the general mouse population, let alone the general human population. So once again, the media fire turns out to be a false alarm – unless of course you’re a transgenic mouse. For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama References 1.

Why is iron necessary in the body? What happens if you’re deficient? What are those symptoms? How prevalent is it? Who is most susceptible? And then ultimately really lean into what can someone do about this? And is there even any concern if you have too much iron? Peter says: This is a topic that is far more complicated topic than we’re going to cover today, and that’s by design “As we got down the rabbit hole of iron biology, it was like the most overwhelming thing I’ve ever encountered, at least for me. And I realized that we needed to bring it way back to make it more actionable. And I think we’ve struck that balance here today.” The goal of this podcast is for listeners to: Know what blood tests you should get so you can ask for them Know how to look at it and interpret it And know what to do about it Additionally, Peter will answer some rapid-fire questions unrelated to iron, such as the following: Do you take creatine? Do you worry about the sodium in your venison sticks? A few other questions that we’ve seen come through a lot that will also tack on at the end of this The importance and ubiquity of iron in the body, and the role of the protein called ferritin [4:30] Why is iron so necessary in the body and why is this something that people should think about? Basically 2% of the human genome encodes for iron-related proteins—that a staggering amount Of these, nearly half are heme-binding proteins What is it about iron that’s important in the body? Well, a big part of it comes down to all things related to hemoglobin and oxygen binding and oxygen transport Another big part is that 6.5% of all enzymes in the human body are iron-dependent. An enzyme is a substance that facilitates a chemical reaction So if you think about the trillions of chemical reactions that are going on inside of our body, imagine how many of them are facilitated by enzymes that depend on iron. If you forget everything else about iron’s importance, just remember this, you’re not going to be able to move oxygen around your body without it And when it comes to your mitochondria and other very important places in the body where cellular respiration takes place, some of the most important enzymes depend on iron. Do only certain tissues require iron, or is it something that is necessary throughout the whole body? After a bit of searching, Peter had a hard time finding an example of a tissue that didn’t require iron — which tells you just how important it is As we get into how do you measure iron levels and stuff, a very important protein is going to come up over and over again—that protein is called ferritin If you’ve ever had at least a reasonably comprehensive blood test where they’ve checked more than just your iron level, hopefully you’ve noticed that they’ve checked your ferritin level Take home message number one of this podcast is: if your doctors are not checking your ferritin levels, please ask that they do It’s not enough to just know what your iron level is, you have to know what that ferritin level is as well This is a very, very ubiquitous protein which is sort of analogous to a lipoprotein it’s a huge spherical protein and its purpose is to store iron And its stores iron to the tune of, about 4,500 iron ions fit within one ferritin sphere Where it differs from lipoproteins is that the purpose of lipoproteins is not really to store cholesterol, but really to transport them, and in the case of ferritin, it’s really more about storage and there’s a little bit of transport Most ferritin actually resides within tissues, namely the muscle and the liver But a small amount of ferritin is obviously found in the serum and that’s how we sample it. And that’s why when you go and get a blood test, one of the things you look at is ferritin because it’s measuring the concentration of ferritin *A very important point* Ferritin is also what is known as an acute phase reactant what that means is, anytime inflammation is present in the body, you will see ferritin levels rise and they will rise independent of iron levels Ferritin being the total body store of iron, the most dominant protein that speaks to total body iron stores when it is high, all things being equal, iron levels are high, and when it is low, the converse of that is the case But when a person has an infection, for example, their ferritin level can be high even if they are deficient in iron Similarly, if a person has chronic inflammation, their ferritin level will be elevated as will other acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein, even while total body stores of iron remain low So therefore, you have to be a bit more nuanced in your appreciation for how to measure total body iron stores so that you can not be fooled or misled by high or low levels of ferritin.

      "title": "Resistance training partially reverses some of the hallmarks of aging type II muscle fibers",
      "content": "As we get older, the age-related decline in muscle mass and strength – known as sarcopenia – is one of the major impediments to performing the tasks of daily living, such as getting in and out of bed, shopping, walking, and preparing meals. Depending on your age, sarcopenia may seem like a concern for the distant future, but the declines in muscle quality begin earlier than many realize, with metrics such as muscle strength and power (strength multiplied by the speed of movement) starting to decline around age 40. Movements requiring strength and power recruit type II muscle fibers, which are known to atrophy with age more rapidly than type I (endurance-type) muscle fibers. In fact, the atrophy (shrinking) of these most powerful type II muscle fibers may be one of the most critical hallmarks of aging. Yet despite the trends of muscle aging at the population level, this process may not be as inevitable for any given individual as it might seem. A recent study tested whether heavy resistance training could reverse some of the age-related cellular-level changes in skeletal muscle that are generally considered irreversible. Cellular level changes in aging muscle In cross-section, healthy skeletal muscle fibers are tightly packed and form a tessellation, with each fiber taking the approximate shape of a pentagon or hexagon. However, as a muscle fiber atrophies, it tends to take on a more complex and often elongated shape in cross-section. One of the ways to quantify the irregularities in shape is with a “shape factor index” (SFI), which calculates the ratio of the fiber’s perimeter to the fiber’s cross-sectional area. The SFI of a perfect circle is one, whereas an oval with the same area as the circle will have an SFI greater than one. This metric quantifies the deformity of the shape of muscle fibers in cross-section (with higher numbers corresponding to greater deformity) but does not account for the overall size of the fiber (see panel A in the Figure below). Instead, the SFI distinguishes two fibers of similar cross-sectional areas with different levels of deformity (see panels B and C). Figure. Shape factor index (SFI) overview. (A) SFI is a dimensionless descriptor of shape, as shown with the same myofiber in three different sizes. (B) High SFI values indicate increased deviation from a circle, as illustrated by two fibers with similar cross-sectional areas but different shapes. (C) SFI values for a circle and four myofibers of different shapes. The area and perimeter values are from actual measurements of myofibers on cryosections. Muscle fiber deformity correlates with age This study used quadriceps muscle biopsies from 197 individuals, who were largely physically inactive, to quantify the deformities in the muscle fiber shape of both type I and type II fibers and assess age-related trends in performance and cellular morphology. For analysis, participants were separated into three groups by age – young (20-36 years), old (60-79), and oldest old (81-97). In the evaluation of the muscle biopsies, mean SFI exhibited a significant increase across increasing age groups for both type I and type II muscle fibers, demonstrating that the measurement of myofiber shape distortion increases with advancing age, regardless of muscle fiber type. However, the age-related increase in SFI was greater in type II fibers than in type I fibers, and the mean SFI was higher in type II fibers than in type I fibers across all age groups, implying that the type II variety are even more susceptible to atrophy and deformity across an individual’s lifespan than type I fibers. Indeed, compared to the young group, the old and oldest-old groups respectively had a 6.2% and 13.6% higher SFI in type II muscle fibers. Additionally, type II fiber SFI was an independent predictor of overall muscle size (as measured by the cross-sectional area of the quadriceps) and muscle strength (as measured by isometric and isokinetic maximal voluntary contractions). The effect of resistance training A subset (n=59) of this cohort then participated in heavy resistance training, which consisted of supervised training three times per week. Since the study aimed to evaluate changes in the quadriceps muscle, only leg exercises were required as resistance training. Training included a 5-min warm-up of low- to moderate-intensity cycling, followed by 3-5 sets of 8-15 repetitions of leg press, leg extension, and leg curl, as well as two optional upper body exercises. These exercises were performed using the maximal weight possible while still completing the 8-15 repetitions. When a participant achieved a target number of repetitions at a given load, the load for that exercise was continuously increased. After 3-4 months of this training protocol, a second muscle biopsy was taken from these individuals. Compared to baseline, both the young and old groups had a 3-4% decrease in average SFI of type II fibers post-training – a significant change and a partial reversal of the age-related trend. Though no participants in the “oldest old” group were part of the resistance training intervention, the finding that young and old groups experienced similar reductions in type II fiber SFI from suggests that age may not compromise the ability to improve muscle quality through resistance training as much as previously thought – which in turn would imply that “age-related” decline in muscle quality is not as unavoidable as previously thought and more likely reflects a decline in muscle use. (This would also explain why type I fibers see a more modest age-associated increases in deformity, given that these fibers are more important for movements in daily life activities and thus are less likely to be subject to steep declines in use). Furthermore, though 3-4 months of training did not bring the old group quite to the level of the young group’s baseline values, it’s possible with a longer training history, they might experience even more adaptation and further diminish the difference in SFI of type II myofibers between these two groups. Adding further support for the “use it or lose it” concept of muscle decline, the investigators also tested a subset of muscle biopsies for the presence of a biomarker of myofiber denervation. Denervated myofibers had high SFI values, and the presence of denervated myofibers increased with age, which supports the hypothesis that the deformities in myofiber shape may occur after the loss of motor neuron innervation. The importance of resistance training at any age It is well known that, on a population level, type II muscle fibers atrophy with aging and inactivity. However, it is not clear to what degree these age-related changes might be avoidable. I find myself, personally, unconvinced that the magnitude of decline we see at the population level is biologically inevitable. Rather, I believe it is driven more by a vicious cycle of inactivity and deconditioning. This study provides additional context about how a lack of use, particularly of type II fibers, translates into motor neuron denervation, leading to atrophy and deformity in the muscle fibers. Yet mechanical loading through resistance training stimulates muscle fiber recruitment, which at least partially reverses some of the age-related trends. Similar findings were demonstrated in another recent study of master sprinters (ages 40-85) who, over the 10-year follow-up, showed no change in quadriceps fiber composition or fiber cross-sectional area (meaning no fiber atrophy) as long as they continued their sprint training. Sprinting, like resistance training, also heavily recruits type II muscle fibers, suggesting that consistent training of these fibers is the key to reducing their atrophy as we age. Remarkably, the reduction in SFI in type II fibers after resistance training was seen across all age groups, as was the higher level of deformity in type II fibers compared to type I fibers. Although older adults had higher SFI and accompanying denervation, these observations imply that this slow decline starts from disuse earlier in life. Training (and maintaining training) throughout life may be a way to minimize what is popularly misconceived to be unavoidable. And while the resistance training intervention in this study was limited to people younger than 80 years of age, there is no reason to think that resistance training wouldn’t be able to stimulate similar changes in people of even older ages, since resistance training is known to increase strength and hypertrophy at any age. The bottom line Exercise, and in particular resistance training, is one of the most effective ways to combat sarcopenia, and the so-called “age-related” declines in muscle composition are not as unavoidable as many might assume. The results of this study demonstrate that heavy resistance training creates gross adaptations to skeletal muscle in the form of strength and hypertrophy and suggest that the irregular shape of atrophied muscle fibers is a hallmark of insufficient stimuli more than chronological age alone. Older muscle still responds to resistance training, proving again that it’s never too early or too late to start reaping the benefits of this crucial strategy for preventing muscle losses with age.

      "title": "The [almost] unbelievable effects of a high maximal aerobic capacity on all-cause mortality",
      "content": "A “Goldilocks principle” applies to many health metrics – going either too low or too high can increase the risk of disease and mortality. For instance, when blood pressure is too high, it is a risk factor for heart attacks and strokes, but when too low, it increases the risks of blood clots and fainting. But the Goldilocks rule certainly has exceptions, and with respect to longevity, one of the most notable of these exceptions is maximal aerobic capacity – known as VO2 max. Not only has it been shown that increasing VO2 max is associated with a monotonic risk reduction in cardiovascular mortality, but increasing VO2 max is also associated with a monotonic risk reduction of all-cause mortality (ACM) at any age.

Courtney grew up as a ballet dancer and spent a lot of time in ballet pointe shoes These shoes are very rigid, stiff, and you’re up on your toes All through grade school and high school, she spent a lot of time on her feet She always battled foot pain She chose this career through self-exploration She is a chiropractor by training, and she thought she was going to learn all of this stuff about the foot but that just didn’t happen She really didn’t get a lot of education in regards to how the foot actually functions Why did you choose chiropractor over say podiatry or something that was purely focused on the foot? She had this conversation with her father many times First she was going to go down the physical therapy route But she wanted to create her own treatment protocols Her dad has always been a big fan of chiropractic She has always been interested in exercise and movement, and it just seemed like a good fit She had maybe half a semester in school on the foot, and she was fascinated That’s more time than Peter would’ve guessed The foot has always intrigued Courtney ‒ it’s a very complex part of the body With our education, the foot was always viewed as if something hurts in the foot, we’re either going to put an orthotic under it or refer them for some type of surgery Courtney was blessed enough to have some really good mentors around that increased her appetite for learning about that, and that’s how it started She ended up graduating from school and working in a couple of orthotic labs Courtney went straight from school directly into specializing in the foot Orthotic labs are presumably a place where people come and have custom orthotics made? Yes She would work in the front offices and there’d be grinders in the back where they made the orthotics They would see patients who had foot pain, and they would cast them for orthotics and make the orthotics When she came out of school, her knowledge and practice was largely still based on the conventional way of putting support under the foot, hoping for the best Courtney has evolved leaps and bounds ahead of that to where she is today The vital role of foot strength, function, and health in human movement and well-being [6:15] The complexity of the foot: One of our superpowers is that we’re a biped We have so many cutaneous receptors, muscle spindles, joint proprioceptors on and in our feet that communicate with our vestibular system so we can become upright and bipedal When you take away those functions, it really alters how you’re moving, how you’re interacting with your environment It’s always so wild because when we think about it from a rehabilitation perspective, we are very good at rehabbing the low backs We do a lot of core strength, we do a lot of glute strength, we do a lot of hip strength But you don’t hear many people saying, “I’m doing a lot of foot strength,” and it’s literally our first interface with the ground That’s how everything starts “When we take that [foot strength] away, you’re really making it much more challenging for yourself, and I think it really can alter our survival as well as decrease our quality of life.”‒ Courtney Conley Using race cars an an analogy Peter is obsessed with race cars, and there are 4 things that determine the speed of a car: the engine, the chassis (the aerodynamics, the stiffness), the driver’s capabilities (what they can do in the car), and the tires The analogy is clearly that the tires are the feet and you can have the greatest car in the world, the most powerful engine, the most remarkable chassis, and the best driver, and if the tires are shot, none of it matters Without them, you simply can’t get the power to the ground and back He thinks there’s a lot to be said for how it is imperative Peter would even go one step further: feet are even a more important part of the human body than tires are to the car {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Research Worth Sharing, March 2024 Edition",
      "content": "AI analysis of plasma proteins for estimating the age of specific organs Why we are interested: As Dr. Rich Miller recently discussed, we currently have limited biomarkers for tracking aging systemically and are virtually lacking organ-specific aging markers altogether. Accelerated organ aging contributes to disease, and development of methods to determine organ age could be valuable for predicting risk of specific diseases. What the study showed: This study developed machine learning models to analyze plasma proteins originating from specific organs and assess their ability to predict organ-specific aging and disease. Accelerated aging in a single organ was reported in 20% of the study population, and organ-specific aging was associated with higher mortality risk and higher incidence of disease in the organ in question (e.g., brain age was strongly associated with Alzheimer’s disease and was useful in predicting the probability of dementia progression). Additionally, certain conditions, including heart attack and Alzheimer’s disease, were associated with accelerated aging in all organs. doi: 10.1038/s41586-023-06802-1 A blood-based test for certain brain tumors Why we are interested: Diagnosis of malignant tumors in the brain is a challenging process. Neural imaging can detect the presence of abnormal masses, but determining whether the mass is benign (as it is in most cases) or malignant typically requires a brain biopsy – a procedure with substantial risks depending on the site within the brain. Less invasive methods would therefore be highly likely to reduce complications involved in the process of diagnosing (or ruling out) brain cancer. The investigators behind this recent study report on such a non-invasive, blood-based method for detecting gliomas (malignancies of glial cells), which are the most prevalent type of brain tumors. What the study showed: This study reports the performance characteristics of a blood-based test that detects malignant glial cells that have been shed by the primary tumor and have entered circulation. The test was initially validated using spiked control samples, from which it was found to have a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83.1-99.4%) and a specificity of 100%(95% CI: 85.8-100%). Performance was then assessed based on real samples derived from patients across four study cohorts – which variously recruited healthy patients, patients with symptoms and/or observed lesions based on neuroimaging, or patients with known cancer of any type. Samples were analyzed in a blinded manner, and results showed high sensitivity (99.35%; 95% CI: 96.44-99.98%; n=154), specificity (100% (95% CI: 99.37-100%; n=588), and accuracy (99.87%; 95% CI: 99.25-100%; n=742). Though the test is not intended as a screening tool for healthy individuals, the authors propose its use as an alternative or supplement to brain biopsy for patients with abnormalities in neural imaging tests. doi: 10.1002/ijc.34827 Compounds in bananas limit absorption of beneficial polyphenols from other fruits Why we are interested: Fruits and vegetables are an essential part of a healthy diet, and as discussed in AMA #36, many studies have shown health benefits of specific plant-derived compounds. For instance, some research indicates that flavan-3-ols – a type of flavonoid and polyphenol found in cocoa, tea, and some fruits – may reduce the risk of cardiovascular death. However, combining certain compounds can interfere with their absorption and effects, so in order to derive maximal benefit from plant-derived compounds, we must be aware of and account for interactions such as the one investigated in this study. What the study showed: In this single-blinded crossover study, eight men consumed either a capsule of cocoa extracta berry smoothie containing cocoa extract, or a banana smoothie containing cocoa extract. The flavan-3-ol bioavailability (from the cocoa extract) was assessed by measuring the level of flavan-3-ol metabolites in both plasma and urine. Absorption of flavan-3-ols was found to be inhibited when consumed with the banana smoothie but not the mixed berry smoothie, with peak flavan-3-ol metabolite levels demonstrating an 84% reduction with the banana smoothie. The effect was attributed to the banana smoothie having high polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, as this enzyme reacts with flavan-3-ols found in cocoa and other fruit polyphenols. So while bananas might be a tasty addition to smoothies, they may prevent you from getting the benefits of flavonoids found in chocolate or other fruits. doi: 10.1039/d3fo01599h Old primates also have trouble climbing stairs Why we are interested: Measures of subclinical frailty and motor competencies can be used to assess physical function and predict all-cause mortality, but no single motor function test is sensitive to all aspects of age-related functional decline. Thus, identifying new, simple tests that can accurately evaluate a range of functions improves overall physical assessments and health predictions, and given their close relationship to humans and relatively experimentally-friendly lifespans, non-human primates are an excellent model for such test development. What the study showed: This study evaluated stair climbing speed as a metric for assessing aging-related physical decline before disease and loss of function occur. Compared to walking speed (a standard motor competency test), they found that stair climbing was better associated with chronological age (R= -0.68 vs. -0.45 for walking speed) and declined further with age, suggesting that stair climbing speed may be more effective as a method for detecting subclinical frailty. Of course, there’s no guarantee that the test would likewise outperform walking speed in humans (for whom walking quickly seems a far more natural skill than for the vervet monkeys used in this study), but regardless of whether stair climbing represents the best test for frailty, the important takeaway is that it might represent another tool to use in addition to other tests to obtain a fuller picture of functional decline. doi: 10.1002/ajp.23582 Low omega-3 intake interacts with a family history to increase CVD risk Why we are interested: Consuming higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) has been shown to have a protective role against cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the role of EPA/DHA in modifying CVD risk associated with a family history of CVD is unknown. What the study showed: This study pooled the results from 15 observational studies (for a total of >40,000 adults without CVD), analyzed blood levels of EPA/DHA, and collected family history of CVD. The authors report a significant interaction between low EPA/DHA and family history of CVD, in which low EPA/DHA plus a family history was associated with a relative risk of 1.41 (95% CI: 1.30–1.54), higher than for either low EPA/DHA (RR=1.06; 95% CI: 0.98–1.14) or family history of CVD (RR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.16–1.33) alone. In other words, these results indicate that EPA/DHA is more protective among those with a family history than among the general population, providing greater motivation to emphasize intake of fish oil (EPA/DHA) as an important risk mitigation strategy for patients with family history of CVD. doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.065530 For a list of all previous weekly emails, click here. podcast | website | ama",

and the profound impact of transportation accidents on human lives [4:15] This is a topic that given the consequences doesn’t get enough enough attention People may not appreciate the frequency of such interactions, and Peter is hoping to understand how much of what we are going to discuss today is under our control In particular the role of fatigue in accidental deaths “We’re all in vehicles moving around, and yet we have come to accept the carnage in ways that should just be unacceptable in our society.”‒ Mark Rosekind This is prevalent in everybody’s life Just being on the road Everyone is a pedestrian at some point Mark will discuss what you can control, what you should be doing to be safer, and what you can’t control Mark’s background and the loss of his father at a young age Mark lost his father a long time ago, but it is still challenging to talk about It was not until his Senate confirmation hearing to be administrator of NHTSA that he talked publicly about this very much His father was a San Francisco motorcycle policeman He was chasing a traffic violator and somebody ran a red light, hit him, and he was killed in the line of duty Behind Mark is a shadow box with his badge and Purple Heart His father was 30 years old Mark was 3 and his brother was 2 They were raised by a single parent This just points out, this is personal for Mark, but he doesn’t wear that as a badge on his shoulder every time we have the conversation His father’s death was clearly foundational to what put him on a lifelong path of pursuing safety and how to make people’s lives safer The human part of statistics One of the things he often talks about is how many lives were lost The exact number is important because every one of those is a father or sister or brother or some relative or one of your neighbors, etc. Those are real people and we cannot bring them back Too often when we start talking about all the statistics, we walk right by the human part of this and that gets lost Peter agrees, and there is a quote he is not remembering exactly, but it speaks to the idea that a million people is a statistic, but a small number of people is a story We can get numb to what those numbers mean There’s a series on Netflix right now that takes old footage from World War II and does some remarkable technology application where it puts it back into color ‒ it’s stunning What’s hard to fathom as you go through this is the loss of life (60-80 million) Peter realized as he came to the end of this that he doesn’t even know what that means He has never seen 1 million people What this series does very well is what Mark has done ‒ get a few stories that are very representative of the horrific nature of what happened Then imagine multiplying that by a thousand or a million Mark agrees, “The numbers numb you.” Often in talks he starts with what we call “the business of bent metal” Having been at the NTSB, he’ll literally take photos from investigations (minus the humans) It’s like: this was Dawn at 20 years old, she not only lost her life, but the people in this minivan you see (4 out of 5 died, and the only one who didn’t was a child in a car) That makes it real for people What you hope is people translate that to understand that it could be you or a partner or your kids or your neighbor (people that matter) There’s this huge gap between those numbers (which most people have no concept), and when somebody actually in your circle loses their life in some kind of crash Before we get into those statistics, explain your training: what brought you to Yale, what you studied, and how that led to what you are doing now The arc of this is more of a zigzag Mark is trained as a scientist He was a pre-med at Stanford and had the incredibly good fortune to take a course called Sleep and Dreams when he was a sophomore It was taught by William Dement, MD, PhD, a professor in the medical school Dr. Dement was part of the team that discovered REM sleep, and some believed he was actually the guy who coined the term REM sleep We’ve only known about non-REM and REM sleep since the mid-50s Dr. Dement came to Stanford and started one of the first sleep centers and was teaching this undergraduate course and it was just fascinating He was this passionate charismatic professor who was engaging Here’s this medical school professor teaching an undergraduate course At the time, the 2 most popular courses were Sleep and Dreams and Human Sex (taught by another medical school professor) What was really brilliant about what Bill did is he actually offered a couple courses You could take a course and become a TA for Sleep and Dreams, or you could take another course and learn where to put electrodes and how to score sleep and actually get involved in research The summer after Mark’s sophomore year, he signed up to be a research assistant staying up all night in a laboratory As an undergraduate, that was an incredible experience Everything got canceled that summer except 1 project which was studying the effects of the water bed surface on sleep This was the ’70s, and Mark met his wife during that study You don’t usually get the opportunity to be involved in research as an undergraduate and that changed everything When he graduated, Dr. Dement made an offer for him to stay and run research projects If you knew where the electrodes went, and this is a K complex, a sleep spindle, here’s how you score sleep, you could run projects Mark did that for a few years and he tells people, “That was like doing a postdoc before going to graduate school.” Mark applied to med school but changed because at the time, there was no sleep speciality, no sleep medicine fellowship Dr. Dement was pushing to make that real So if he wanted to spend a career looking at sleep, he had to get a Ph.D. Yale had a great academic research program and Mark could also get clinical training He could get clinical training in clinical psychology but still do research The interesting spin is that after he finished his Ph.D., someone he knew from Stanford asked him to do a postdoc ‒ Mary Carskadon She had been at Stanford with Bill and they created what is now the gold standard for objectively measuring sleepiness called the “Multiple Sleep Latency Test” She moved Brown Medical school as an assistant professor and had 1 technician The plan was for Mark to stay at Brown, get on the faculty, etc. Instead, he ended up going back and working for Bill, running a human research program for a while From sleep science to safety leadership: Mark’s journey in transportation innovation [14:15] Mark was a hardcore sleep academic, but part of his job was to get new projects going He got engaged with NASA Ames Group, which is one of the NASA facilities in Mountain View, California, and they were doing fatigue jet lag research NASA didn’t have many actual sleep people helping them do that, some chronobiology circadian people It was fascinating because they were doing a study that required recording EEG in a cockpit and they weren’t really sure how to do that Part of Mark’s job was to help them problem solve that so they could record pilot’s brain and eye movement activity in an ongoing way during flights That was a transition really out of the very specific academic environment to NASA Mark’s time at NASA Mark was recruited to work with the NASA Ames Group and directed the program at the NASA Ames Fatigue Countermeasures program for 7 years It was fantastic This illustrates what has become a clear focus of his career: the application of the science into real world application That has really been a force for him throughout my career Hence the safety emphasis, great sleep science How do you use that to help people every day, whether that’s driving a car or flying a space shuttle? What do you do to make that better? He worked with commercial and military pilots, astronauts, controllers at Johnson Space Center, etc. Fantastic, incredible work Then he started his own company Which broadened it from aerospace to basically everybody When he had his own company, they worked with folks in all modes of transportation, all over the world in healthcare, energy, military operations, you name it It was fantastic The next part that was so interesting, part of the zag was Mark had the opportunity to become a board member at the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Does time-restricted eating increase the risk of cardiovascular death?",
      "content": "No matter what your stance on a particular topic is, you can nearly always find a study that supports your point of view. What matters more than being able to find a published study with a particular outcome is the quality of that study. Case in point: last Monday, researchers presented unpublished (read: not peer-reviewed) data from an observational study, concluding that time-restricted eating (TRE) was associated with a 91% increase in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, which resulted in a frenzy of headlines by many news outlets. If you already think that TRE is harmful to health, you might take the headline at face value; but if you look with a closer eye, you’ll find that the results from this study are virtually meaningless. What do we know about this study? This study was presented as a poster at a conference, meaning that study details are limited and the full study still needs to be peer-reviewed before publication, as noted above. Randomized trials have been used to study the potential health benefits of TRE, but usually with limited duration. The motivation for this study was to see if long-term use of TRE affected mortality, something that would be extremely difficult to do with a randomized trial. For this retrospective, observational study, the researchers used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected between 2003 and 2018 from more than 20,000 people in the US. Each year, NHANES collects demographic, biomarker, and dietary data from approximately 5,000 randomly selected US residents to track changes in overall population trends. Each food recall questionnaire requires the participant to remember what they ate, how much, and at what times on the previous day. This study required that every participant completed two food recall surveys less than two weeks apart, and averaged their two feeding windows to determine each person’s eating duration. Try to quantify exactly how much food you ate yesterday and recall when you ate it. Unless you are the type of person who writes all of this information down while preparing your meals, you likely can’t do this with any accuracy. Asking this question of a large group produces unreliable data contaminated by recall biases. If survey respondents misremember the time of their first and last food intake by just 30 minutes, total eating duration changes by an hour. A common form of TRE, sometimes called 16:8, or sixteen hours of fasting followed by eight hours of opportunity to eat, is less common across the population than a pattern of eating three to four meals spread throughout the day, over twelve or more hours. For this reason, the participants were broken out into five categories based on their average eating duration: < 8 hours (the TRE group), 8-<10 hours, 10-<12 hours, 12-16 hours (the reference group), or >16 hours. Each eating duration group was followed for a median of eight years for outcomes of all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and cancer mortality using the National Death Index database. Like most hazard models of mortality, these outcomes were adjusted for age, sex, race, total energy intake, education, income, food security status, smoking, drinking, physical activity, diet quality score, body mass index (BMI), BMI squared, and any self-reported health conditions. This number of adjustments alone should tell you that many variables contribute to our dietary patterns and potentially confound any relationship between feeding window and mortality. If you’re interested in a deeper dive into nutrition research and the limits of nutritional epidemiology, my conversation with David Allison is an excellent starting point. What did the study find? Although there were no significant differences in all-cause mortality – the most important metric, obviously – across any of the eating duration groups, the TRE group had a hazard ratio for CV death of 1.91 (95% CI: 1.20-3.03) compared to the reference (12-16-hour) group – a relative 91% increase in the risk of CV death, and an absolute increase of 3.9% in the risk of CV mortality – which is significant. But, of equal importance, the TRE group wasn’t just different from the non-TRE group based on the timing; there were significant differences in other lifestyle habits and co-morbidities. This is highlighted by the fact that the relative increase in CV deaths was disproportionately driven by the deaths of people with pre-existing conditions. For unknown reasons, the percentage of CV deaths in the TRE group was nearly 38% in those with pre-existing CVD compared to 15% in the reference group. Family history of CVD and rates of diabetes and dyslipidemia were not included in the poster presentation, and it’s unclear if they were considered in this risk analysis. Beyond the mortality differences in the subanalysis of participants with pre-existing conditions, the significant discrepancies between group sample sizes and limited demographic information are more reasons to be skeptical of the findings. The TRE group had only 414 participants and a total of just 31 deaths compared to the reference group, which had 11,831 participants and 423 deaths. The TRE group also had a higher average BMI, were more likely to smoke, and were on average younger compared to the reference group, indicating that the groups themselves are different in more ways than just eating duration, making it almost impossible to compare the two groups. Flaws in methodology While it is valid to ask the underlying scientific question, “Does the long-term implementation of TRE affect lifespan?” the flawed methodology leaves that question still to be answered. Not only due to the substantial bias in nutritional self-reporting but also because the only requirements were two food recall surveys at the beginning of the observation period. The researchers assumed this was enough data to represent the participants’ “normal” eating patterns of both eating duration and total energy intake – for the next eight years, a lofty expectation given that most people will have some degree of fluctuation in their diet over nearly a decade. For participants who completed both questionnaires and had long-term follow-up data, the only other exclusion criteria were either eating >8000 kcal or <800 kcal per day for men, >6000 kcal or <600 kcal per day for women, or an “unusual” diet on either recall day. It’s unclear what makes a diet “unusual,” but where the participants fell in this extreme range of caloric intake, which would largely be considered unhealthy at both ends for most people, is a huge missing factor in this analysis. Although the analysis adjusted for total energy intake, this could potentially be a confounding factor, not necessarily in comparing the groups to one another, but in evaluating the likelihood of mortality. That is, if you are overeating, regardless of the duration, are you more likely to die? Previous controlled trials have demonstrated that TRE can be more effective at reducing overall energy intake than caloric restriction alone; but when TRE is implemented in an isocaloric setting, it does not have any additional benefit over caloric restriction, essentially saying that it matters how many calories you eat more than when you eat them. The utility and drawbacks of TRE It’s not that there is no value in TRE; many people find it an incredibly useful way to lose or maintain weight, simply because rather than tracking calories or controlling portion size, one can focus on eating window alone. However, one of the biggest drawbacks of this approach is that it can be difficult to obtain adequate protein, especially as the eating window shortens. Although not included in the poster data, DEXA scans which measure lean mass are collected as part of the NHANES data. The authors reported that, in unpublished data, people who were in the TRE group had less lean mass than those in the reference group, which would demonstrate this shortcoming of TRE. However, without quantifying the inter-group differences, it’s impossible to say whether it explains the differences in deaths. Obtaining sufficient protein to maintain and build muscle is something to keep in mind if TRE is either something you already do or plan to try in the future. It’s an especially important consideration as you age since it becomes increasingly difficult to gain muscle later in life, particularly if you are inactive. The bottom line It’s unfortunate that results such as these, which aren’t even in their finished form, are being used to scare people away from time-restricted eating, which is a proven weight loss strategy. This is yet another nutritional study that affirms my disappointment in the field – not because the topic is unworthy of research, but because of the willingness to draw sensational conclusions from flawed data.

      "title": "“DNA diets” are still a long way off from offering an easier route to weight loss",
      "content": "With rates of obesity and associated diseases continuing to rise across the globe, we are constantly bombarded with new diet strategies to help us shed the excess pounds. One approach that has been gaining increasing interest in recent years is the use of genetics to create personalized diets to optimize metabolic responses to food intake. These so-called “DNA diets” are based on the concept of nutrigenetics, which describes how genetic variation influences responses to certain foods across individuals. But is there any evidence that such “genetically validated” diets truly provide a benefit for weight loss? A recent randomized clinical trial by Höchsmann and colleagues sought to address this question. Genetics impact food processing We know that many genes alter our experience with food (e.g., some people possess mutations that make cilantro taste like soap), and we know that certain gene variants influence our ability to process foods (think: lactose intolerance, caused by variants in the LCT gene), so it is not unreasonable to think that we might be able to use genetically determined variation in nutrient absorption and metabolism to determine which foods an individual responds to in such a way that promotes greater energy expenditure or a reduction in overall appetite. Genes of particular interest in this capacity would include those involved in metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, as genetics could then be used to inform an individual’s optimal ratio of these two macronutrients for promoting weight loss and metabolic health. One such gene could be AMY1, which encodes amylase, the enzyme found in saliva that is responsible for breaking down carbohydrates. Some individuals possess multiple replicates of this gene on the same chromosome, and greater copy numbers of AMY1 are thought to result in more efficient/effective digestion of carbohydrates, conferring higher “carb-tolerance” to these individuals. Fat processing, meanwhile, may be influenced by variants in genes encoding fatty acid desaturase enzymes, including FADS1 and FADS2, which are involved in fat metabolism and have been linked with weight gain. The fact that genes influence our processing of certain macronutrients motivated Höchsmann et al. to test the notion that individual genetic profiles might be leveraged to aid in weight loss. About The Study In their 12-week randomized trial among subjects with overweight or obesity, the investigators first tested participants for variants (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) in ten genes thought to be associated with metabolic responses to dietary carbohydrate or fat. For each of these SNPs, an individual could have one of three genotypes (i.e., homozygous for one variant, homozygous for the alternative variant, or heterozygous – that is, one copy of each variant), so each was scored as a 0-2 for “high fat/low-carbohydrate” and “high carbohydrate/low-fat” responsiveness, and scores were aggregated. Participants were determined to be “fat-responders” (meaning they were expected to lose weight more easily with a diet high in fat) if they scored ≥4 for a potential high-fat response and <7 for a potential high-carbohydrate response, and they were determined to be “carbohydrate responders” (expected to lose weight more easily with a diet high in carbohydrates) if they scored <4 for a potential high-fat response and ≥7 for a potential high-carbohydrate response. From the original pool of 275 eligible participants who underwent genetic testing, 106 were excluded because they were determined to be responsive to neither dietary pattern or to both. “Fat responder” and “carbohydrate responder” groups were then subdivided to receive a diet either aligned with their genotype (genotype-concordant) or at odds with their genotype (genotype-discordant), resulting in four total groups: (1) fat-responders on high-fat diet (n=44); (2) fat-responders on high-carbohydrate diet (n=41); (3) carbohydrate-responders on high-fat diet (n=21), and (4) carbohydrate-responders on high-carbohydrate diet (n=16). The high-fat diet consisted of 40% calories from fat and 45% calories from carbohydrates, while the high-carbohydrate diet consisted of 20% calories from fat and 65% calories from carbohydrates. Protein accounted for the remaining 15% of calories in both diets. Though food itself was not provided, participants were given detailed diet-specific meal plans. Additionally, these meal plans were designed to impose a calorie deficit for each participant of approximately 750 kcal/day. By the end of the 12-week diet intervention, all four groups showed reductions in both body fat percentage and total body weight. However, the authors observed no statistically significant differences between any groups in either metric, regardless of whether the participants were on a genotype-concordant diet or a genotype-discordant diet, and apart from minor differences in self-reported cravings between groups, they also saw no differences in other outcomes assessed, including blood pressure, HOMA-IR (a measure of insulin resistance), and insulin levels. Though the genetically concordant groups trended slightly and non-significantly toward greater improvements in weight loss (-5.3 kg for genetic-concordant diet vs. -4.8 kg for genetic discordant diet) and body fat percentage reduction (-1.3% for genetic-concordant diet vs. -0.8% for genetic discordant diet), ultimately, this study found that genetically concordant and discordant diets produced the same results, indicating that the intervention that they had in common – namely, the 750 kcal/day caloric deficit – had a far greater impact on body weight and body fat than whether the diet was in line with genetic predispositions. Those on discordant versus concordant diets within each macronutrient response group did not differ even in measures of diet preference, intervention satisfaction, restraint changes, or overall hunger. Thus, it seems likely that even in the case of a longer-term but less severe caloric deficit, adherence would likely not differ in genotype concordant versus genotype discordant groups. Why Nutrigenetics (Currently) Doesn’t Impact Weight Loss As explained above, the logic of genetics-based diets is theoretically reasonable, so why did it fail in practice in this randomized trial? The most likely explanation is that, at present, nutrigenetics simply lacks the fidelity necessary to herald an era of “precision nutrition.” One aspect of this problem is in segregating individuals into diet patterns based on genetics. The Höchsmann et al. study utilized just two very broad categories of diets – differentiated only by the variable of carbohydrate to fat ratio – but used several genes to determine whether a given individual fell into one category or the other. This redundancy ought to increase the accuracy of each participant’s classification, while the broad diet categories ought to maximize the likelihood that a given individual can meet the definitions for either class. Yet even still, over half of eligible participants (106 of 275) did not fit cleanly into either dietary pattern (either because they were responsive to both or neither dietary pattern). Sure, these 106 participants might just need to adopt an intermediate balance of fats and carbohydrates, but the large exclusion rate highlights a bigger problem. Genetically informed diets are not an efficient way of determining one’s response to any single dietary variable. To find out whether you control weight better on a high-fat or high-carbohydrate diet, trying each diet for yourself will provide an answer that is far more reliable, cost-effective, and efficient than getting a genetic test. The real hope for nutrigenetics is in creating more finely tailored diets – taking into account genetic variation in responses to micronutrients, optimal meal times, types of carbohydrates and fats, and countless other variables. But for each additional variable introduced, the likelihood that genetics can be used to accurately and cleanly assign an individual to an “optimal” dietary pattern becomes statistically lower and lower. But the concept of genetically informed diets for weight loss also faces a more inherent problem. Though observational data have shown that some of the genes chosen for this study are associated with obesity, many factors outside of macronutrient-specific digestion also influence body weight. Indeed, the vast majority of obesity-associated genes are expressed primarily in the brain and are thought to exert their effects through their roles in nutrient sensing, food reward signaling, and other processes not directly related to digestion. Many of these processes may be completely unaffected by diet composition, or if diet composition does play a part, the connections are less obvious than with macronutrient-specific digestion pathways, so it’s unclear exactly how to design an optimal diet based on these genetic variants. Finally, there are many, many environmental factors that influence the interaction between obesity-associated genes and diet, adding further complexity and uncertainty. Indeed, even if DNA-informed diet personalization becomes feasible and reliable, at no point will this approach ever provide anyone with a static, life-long action plan for eating. New information will constantly come to light, necessitating revisions to previous algorithms. Other aspects of an individual’s health will change over time, necessitating dietary changes to achieve a new “optimal.” Even foods themselves change, as new options appear or nutrient compositions vary and evolve. Is there a future for nutrigenetics? The field of nutrigenetics has too many unknowns to offer substantial utility in weight loss at present, but it’s important to note that our understanding of both genetics and energy homeostasis has come a long way in a relatively short time, and as knowledge continues to build, it’s possible that a genetic approach to dieting could be a viable option in the future. But as we see from the failure of even the simple, proof-of-principle genetics-based diets used by Höchsmann et al., that future is still a long distance away. To realize it will likely require far more than advances in genetics alone; we will need proteomics, metabolomics, neuroscience, microbiome characterization, and many more fields to come together and form a cohesive picture – one that will nevertheless be subject to change as additional information comes to light. Unfortunately, there is currently no biohacking magic solution when it comes to weight loss. As this current study shows, even the wealth of genetic information now available to us does not yet offer us a way around the two tried-and-true requirements for weight loss: some form of caloric restriction, and maintaining it over time.

It’s something that people see everywhere, it’s marketed a lot, people talk about it, and so we see a lot of questions come through around people who are wondering more about it. What are the different types? How does interval training fit in? Where can it be used? Where is it limited? What’s the “best” protocol? We’ll also hopefully talk a lot about how someone can increase their VO2 max (which has a lot of importance for people who are thinking about their longevity) We’ll also talk about the importance of having a broad exercise program and training, and not just specifically focusing on one thing Anything you want to add before we hit the first question? Peter says that this was a subject matter that he had been kicking down the road a little bit because he couldn’t wrap his head around the right way to present it But he feels like it has finally sort of come together in the last couple of weeks He’s glad they waited until they had the data and the right studies to look at And then, obviously, the implications so that we make this much more rooted in: What do you need to do? As opposed to making sure you understand every molecular pathway of HIIT. The origins of HIIT [3:15] HIIT is such a commonly used word when people talk about exercise. Can you maybe set the stage of where it even comes from? There is some documentation from as far back as the 1800s of athletes who would use a combination of running and walking for their training (runners or long-distance walkers) What it comes down to is some documentation of athletes having altered their tempo between running and walking for their training It wouldn’t really be until kind of the early 1900s that it would be codified more seriously You would originally go back to the Finnish Olympic runners that first employed this type of training The term FARTLEK, coined in the 1930s, is derived from the Swedish language which may translate to something like “speed play” When Peter was growing up, they referred to alternating between fast and slow as “speed play” Tabata Another familiar term is Tabata training A Tabata interval is a very specific type of interval This was first described in the 1990s where a guy by the name of Izumi Tabata who was the first author on a paper that first presented this Interestingly, though, the protocol seems to have been developed by Olympic speed skating coach Koichi Irisawa The interval was eight sets of 20 seconds on a bike, all-out interval with 10 seconds of rest, so you’re 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, eight times, which gives you a four-minute duration Defining HIIT training and differentiating it from sprint interval training (SIT) [5:45] A lot of different programs, classes, gyms that call themselves HIIT training Can you speak a little bit about what HIIT training actually is, and is there a way for people listening or watching to be able to differentiate between the different types or forms that they may see out there? HIIT definitely has a bit of a brand issue, says Peter Part of the problem with everything we’re about to discuss today stems from the fact that there’s no uniform definition in what constitutes HIIT Peter suggests that we be a little bit more specific and we differentiate between, for example, high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, versus sprint interval training, or SIT, or things like Tabata training (which kind of are a bit of a subset of SIT) The reason for that is they produce very different metabolic effects, they’re carried out at very different intensities, and by extension, they have different pros and cons {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Removing race as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease?",
      "content": "Race has a complex and troubled history. There is no question that the concept of race has been used for millennia to justify all manner of atrocities, a practice which tragically continues to this day in some parts of the world. But in modern medicine, race has found another purpose: physicians use this variable, which serves as a stand-in for countless genetic, social, and cultural factors, to better estimate an individual’s risk of many life-threatening diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). And yet, the American Heart Association (AHA) plans to change that. About the announcement In November, the AHA introduced a new calculator – which they’ve called PREVENT, or “Predicting Risk of cardiovascular disease EVENTs” – to assess an individual’s risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. PREVENT incorporates established risk factors – such as hypertension and cigarette smoking – that had been included in the AHA’s previous CVD risk assessment tool (developed in 2013) and also adds to this list factors such as kidney function metrics and measures of glycemic control. But the new tool has gained more attention for the risk factor that it has removed relative to previous iterations: race. The committee responsible for developing PREVENT described race as “a social construct and an historically fraught proxy representing various lived experiences,” rather than a biological factor, and they note that it therefore should not be included in risk assessments. The authors argue that racism – not race itself – is primarily responsible for observed differences in CVD outcomes across populations, suggesting that the inclusion of this variable facilitates the perpetuation of racially motivated disparities in quality of healthcare. They acknowledge that different races are also associated with different levels of CVD risk factors and incidence (indicating that racism in treatment cannot entirely account for the disparities), but the authors make the assumption that these differences are nevertheless attributable to “nonbiological factors.” Race may be an imperfect variable… The AHA is not entirely wrong in asserting that race is a “social construct” rather than a variable defined by any single biological metric, but the notion that race has no relationship to biology is a step too far. Racial distinctions are defined by differences in physical appearance (e.g., skin color or eye shape) broadly associated with various geographical regions of ancestral origin. These correlate with genetic similarities, albeit somewhat inconsistently. For instance, a given individual will, in most cases, be more genetically similar to another of the same racial background than to someone of a different racial background, though this is reportedly not the case roughly one-third of the time, regardless of the specific races studied. It follows that racial designations thus downplay the vast genetic variation that exists within a given race. An analysis of populations from Asia, Africa, and Europe showed that 85-90% of genetic variation across all humans in these regions was present between individuals of the same continent, while differences between separate continents accounted for only 10-15% of total genetic variation. And the level of within-population variation is not uniform. African populations feature greater genetic diversity than all other human populations combined – meaning that, despite two people having the same racial definition of “Black,” if one is from West Africa and another from Southern Africa, they are almost certain to be more genetically distinct from each other than any given Caucasian is from a Pacific Islander, or Asian is from a Native American, etc. And of course, definitions become even muddier when we consider individuals with mixed racial backgrounds. … But it’s better than no information at all And yet, despite the many limitations, race still provides valuable information on disease risk that we cannot currently gain from any other variable. The AHA committee argues in favor of replacing race with other socioeconomic metrics such as income and education, but this would imply that race bears no relationship whatsoever to genetics, which as we’ve just seen, is not the case. Race may be an imperfect estimate of genetics, but imperfect is better than no estimate at all. Yes, we have the technology to perform genetic sequencing to obtain a more direct assessment of one’s genetic background, but in addition to the many practical roadblocks to universal genetic testing, we have not yet reached a level of understanding of the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases to be able to interpret most of the information we’d gain by poring over genetic code. Moreover, some of the associations we do know with respect to genetic variants and disease risk have been found to be true for some races and not others – for instance, as was recently shown with the FTO gene and obesity. As I’ve explained previously, many of those “known” associations are heavily biased toward those of European descent, so individuals of other races would thus be less likely to receive meaningful or accurate health insights from genetic risk assessments. This problem, combined with the financial cost of genetic sequencing, would therefore have the potential to create greater racial disparities in healthcare quality than currently exist with the use of race itself as a risk variable. At present, race tells us more than genetics In contrast to our relatively limited knowledge of genetic associations with disease, a large body of data exists on associations between race and disease, as clinical trials and epidemiology studies commonly collect data on participant racial backgrounds. As a result, we know that certain diseases are more common in some racial groups relative to others. Asian Americans are more likely than their white counterparts to develop stomach cancer. White Americans are more likely than African Americans to develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. African Americans are more likely than any other race in the US to develop hypertension. While some of these disparities in risk likely reflect socioeconomic or cultural differences in addition to differences in genetics, the mere fact that races differ in disease risk helps to point physicians toward areas of potential concern and the appropriate course of action, even if we don’t fully understand the social versus genetic mechanisms. Consider this example: Asians and Pacific Islanders are disproportionately burdened with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and often develop the disease at lower BMI than other groups. These observations led to a national campaign to reduce the recommended BMI threshold for T2D screening to 23 kg/m2 for Asians and Pacific Islanders, in contrast to the cutoff of 25 kg/m2 for the general population. If fully put into practice, the move is estimated to result in the identification of an additional 6,000 cases of T2D among the Asian American population of Massachusetts alone (where the initiative was first passed). In other words, without accounting for race in T2D risk assessments, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders experience a racial disparity in quality of care due to under-screening and underdiagnosis. This campaign – led by the Asian American community – thus pushed for race to be used as a key consideration in evaluating diabetes risk and is poised to vastly improve health outcomes for this population, regardless of ambiguity as to why Asian Americans have a higher risk. Politics over science? When it comes to predicting health outcomes, more information generally leads to better predictions, yet the AHA wishes to throw away a valuable data point. Yes, distinguishing between races creates the potential for discrimination, but some potential will always be there, since removing race from a CVD risk calculator does not remove race (a variable defined largely by appearance) from existence. Further, the logic of reducing risk of bias could easily apply as rationale to exclude nearly every other risk factor as well. Collecting information on a patient’s sex creates the opportunity for sexism. Recording a patient’s weight creates the potential for “sizeism” and discrimination against those who are very obese or very underweight. Asking for information on education history or other socioeconomic factors could lead to classism. And yet we don’t eliminate these variables because, despite the risk, they facilitate better, more informed clinical decisions. When we look at the issue from this perspective, it becomes clear that the AHA’s decision was motivated by political – rather than scientific – rationale, likely inspired by the wave of reports in recent years of racial inequities in medical care. But despite how progressive and appealing it might sound to go “race-free,” when we stop to consider what it would truly mean to sacrifice this information, it becomes clear that the move is likely to result in greater racial disparities in clinical outcomes. Thus, as an organization trusted for its medical expertise and its mission to promote health, the AHA sets an alarming precedent in prioritizing popular politics over scientific rigor and medical reality. Will they similarly be swayed to remove sex as a relevant variable, given that the related variable of gender is regarded as fluid? Will they bow to pressures from other political entities, such as pharmaceutical company lobbies or the reigning political party? If the course of the AHA’s decisions isn’t defined strictly by advances in science and medicine, then there is no clear limit to the potential influence of any number of outside interests. Using available information while understanding limitations Rather than throwing away information that provides clinical value, we should work to ensure that the medical community is aware of the limitations of that information while simultaneously directing efforts toward elucidating the mechanisms underlying racial associations with disease. If, as the AHA asserts, these associations are entirely social in nature, shouldn’t we wait to remove race as a factor until after we know exactly what those social factors are? And if, as existing data suggest, race does have underpinnings in genetics, shouldn’t we wait to eliminate race as a factor until we understand genetic risk factors, as well? I certainly look forward to an era in which we have a perfect, thorough understanding of both social variables and genetic variants as they relate to disease risk and in which everyone has equal access to perfectly accurate genetic risk assessments. But in the absence of the “perfect,” we can’t afford to thumb our noses at “the best we have right now,” regardless of what’s politically in vogue at the moment. Race is far from perfect, but it is currently our best proxy for a complex set of genetic variables – and yes, socioeconomic and cultural variables – that impact disease risk and treatment. The troubled history of race has left many with a negative impression of the entire concept, which undoubtedly motivated the AHA’s announced changes. But we mustn’t place such a high priority on eliminating the formal acknowledgement of race that, in the process, we increase – rather than decrease – racial disparities in healthcare.

      "title": "Optimizing protein quantity, distribution, and quality",
      "content": "Whether you are the type who eats to live or lives to eat, protein intake is a foundational part of nutritional planning to increase or maintain lean mass as you age. Dietary protein provides amino acids, which are essential for building new tissue, repairing old tissue, and conducting basic cellular functions throughout the body. In the human body, protein is formed from 20 different amino acids. Of these 20, nine are deemed “essential” because our bodies cannot synthesize them and must instead obtain them through our diet. Unfortunately, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 0.8 g protein per kg body weight per day is only the minimum amount of protein needed to maintain nitrogen balance and is far too low for goals of increasing lean mass and minimizing the risk of sarcopenia, especially as we age and become anabolically resistant. How much protein each individual requires is more complicated and depends on sex, body weight, lean body mass, and activity level, but essentially, if you under-consume protein, your body will use its own lean mass as a source of amino acids, leading to loss of muscle mass. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) is 10-35% of caloric intake as protein, which is 1.0-3.7 g/kg/d for the average 57-kg woman or 70-kg man. For those who are minimally active, the lower end of this range is probably sufficient to maintain lean mass. However, those who want to increase their lean mass or who partake in moderate or intense physical activity should try to consume higher levels of protein to promote strength and skeletal muscle growth, up to around 1.2-2.2 g protein/kg body weight/day. In our practice, we aim for the upper half of this range, or about 1 g per pound of body weight (2.2 g/kg body weight/day), but optimizing your increase in lean mass through muscle protein synthesis (MPS) via protein intake is more than a matter of how much protein to eat – it also depends on how that protein is distributed over the course of a day, as well as on protein quality.

To give the timeline, Jason went to Bolles School in Jacksonville, FL It’s a very competitive athletic school High school was the hardest thing he’s ever done The English department kicked his butt He had 8 classes and would rather go back to the Special Forces Qualification Course than do a year of English at Bolles Jason played tennis and a little basketball Growing up, he was always into sports and being really active He didn’t know what he was going to do with his life He wasn’t good enough to play tennis at a big school He played D3 tennis at Emory in Atlanta That was a great way for him to focus At Emory, he studied economics and art history Both of his grandmothers were docents at the Dayton Art Institute in Ohio Being in art museums was an important part of how he grew up He did well in college and graduated in May of 2001 He was very focused in college After college, he remembers applying to places that people told him he should: your bank, your consulting firm At age 22, he didn’t know what any of that was What do you do at Goldman Sachs or McKinsey if you’re 22? Importantly, you pay your dues Jaysons explains, “You have to figure out how to get into these larger organizations, and I didn’t know how to do that yet.” So he went and traveled around Central America and backpacked a little bit, then came back and got a job working at a call center of a marketing firm in Dayton Beach on 9/11 Literally across the street from the racetrack That was the day that anybody that was alive remembers exactly where they were on 9/11 For Jason, it was just this enormous sense of sadness and anger that led to rage, and as a 22 years old, military aged male, with no dependants, no attachments, he felt compelled to serve our country Saying you want to serve, watching the night vision goggles (NVGs) and everything is in green on CNN is a lot different that actually signing up to go fight in a time of war Jason looked at all kinds of places: the CIA, the FBI, the whole alphabet soup universe Those places take a long time to get into, and rightfully so Even though he had just gone to college The application process is long It was a time when everybody wanted to serve our country and you couldn’t just walk up, pick your branch, and become an officer There was a line a mile long of young people that wanted to serve our country because of what happened at 9/11 Now it’s 2003 and he had started working at a bank in DC and is still applying to places It keeps not clicking What happened in that year and a half between 9/11 and early 2003? He felt really down where he was in Daytona Beach and Jacksonville Beach, he felt really far away from what was going on He went and visited some friends in New York and being at Ground Zero just felt very communal in a positive way It felt like that’s where the decisions were being made It felt like that was just such an important place at that time, and he wanted to see it He went to New York in October of 2001, and you could smell it anywhere you were God bless the people that worked through that Day after day, they just pulled bodies out of the rubble Jason still gets goosebumps when he thinks about the amount of sacrifice and the service that went into that day and then to the handoff to the military The military is kind of a family business, and you’re best served, if you’re familiar with what that looks like Jason’s path to becoming a Green Beret, his calling to serve, and staying true to oneself [10:30] Peter points out that in late ‘01 and most of ‘02 presumably anybody could walk into a recruiting office and join the Marines or join the Army or things like that (not necessarily special forces) Was that something you were thinking of or were you still thinking you wanted to be in the CIA or something? {end of show notes preview} Would you like access to extensive show notes and references for this podcast (and more)?Check out this post to see an example of what the substantial show notes look like.

      "title": "Aerobic exercise for Parkinson’s disease",
      "content": "Parkinson’s disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and nonmotor function, is the fastest growing neurodegenerative disorder, having doubled in incidence from 1990 to 2015. In the United States alone, PD will affect more than 1 million people by 2030, and projections estimate another doubling of incidence by 2040, raising further interest in strategies for prevention and treatment. We previously discussed exercise as method of early intervention to help delay the motor symptoms of PD (see Episode #236 of The Drive). However, as a 2022 meta-analysis shows, exercise has utility for PD even after disease emergence, until well into its moderate severity stages. What is Parkinson’s disease? PD is associated with degeneration of the dopamine-producing neurons within one of the movement centers of the midbrain, called the substantia nigra pars compacta, which can occur as a result of genetics, environmental toxicant exposure, or other factors. Dopamine-producing neurons within this region are important for both allowing intentional movements and preventing unintentional movements. The loss of these neurons results in the typical motor symptoms associated with PD: tremor, stiffness (called rigidity), slow movement (called bradykinesia), and impaired balance, gait and posture. These neurons are also important for cognition, and loss of dopaminergic influence in the brain can thus impact cognitive function, including decision making and attention processes, as well as mood and sleep. In fact, nonmotor symptoms of PD are very common, and cognitive impairment in particular affects up to 80% of PD individuals. The standard of care for PD includes dopamine replacement (via levodopa, the precursor to dopamine), dopamine receptor agonists, and other forms of medications and interventions (e.g., deep brain stimulation) that increase dopamine levels in the brain. However, over time, medications for PD become less effective, and escalating doses are needed to achieve symptom control. As the disease progresses, these medications wear off more quickly and can lead to a slew of side effects including the development of dyskinesia (involuntary movements). For this reason, non-pharmacological interventions for PD are of high interest, and exercise in particular appears to be an effective option. Exercise has the ability both to protect the remaining intact dopaminergic neurons, as well as modulate dopamine neurotransmission, and it is therefore in a position to serve not only as a powerful therapy on its own, but also as a complement to other standard-of-care PD practices. About the study For their meta-analysis, investigators Zhen and colleagues aggregated randomized controlled trials studying the impact of aerobic exercise on PD symptoms from the last three decades. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (i) must be a randomized controlled trial, (ii) must be conducted in PD patients, (iii) must possess both an aerobic exercise and control group, and (iv) must use motor function and/or quality of life assessments as outcome measures. Motor assessments included measures of balance, mobility, gait (walking speed, stride length), and PD motor symptom severity. After excluding studies that used multiple interventions, the final analysis included 20 studies, from which the authors conducted a pooled analysis to assess the effect of aerobic exercise on any given domain, reporting results as standardized mean differences (SMD). At its most basic level, SMD is a measure of effect size, calculated by dividing a difference in means between groups by a pooled standard deviation to create a summary of the difference between an intervention and control condition. In other words, SMD creates a uniform unit that can be pooled across studies investigating the same outcome, even if those studies vary in cohort sizes and their specific units or instruments of measurement. An SMD of zero, for instance, means there is no difference in effect between an intervention group and a control group, while in most cases, an SMD over zero indicates that an intervention is more effective than control conditions, and an SMD below zero indicates that an intervention is less effective than control conditions, though sometimes these relationships are reversed, depending on the instrument of measurement. Conventionally, an SMD with an absolute value between 0.2 and <0.5 is considered a small effect, between 0.5 and <0.8 is considered a moderate effect, and ≥0.8 is considered a large effect. The authors observed that aerobic exercise interventions in people with PD improved many measures of motor function relative to control individuals, including: (i) faster timed up-and-go speed (SMD: -0.41, 95% CI: -0.61, -0.22), (ii) improved scores on the berg balance scale, which is particularly important because balance issues are not addressed by PD pharmacotherapy (SMD: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.76, 1.23), (iii) improvements to several components of gait, including longer stride length (SMD: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.61), and faster gait velocity (SMD: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.78), and (iv) greater distances achieved on the 6-minute walk test (SMD: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.56). The authors also reported that aerobic exercise improved PD-related motor symptoms relative to controls according to scores on part III of the Unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (SMD: -0.40, 95% CI: -0.55, -0.24). This assessment measures the severity of a variety of motor symptoms, including tremor, rigidity, spontaneous movements at rest, and others, and is the most universally used motor rating scale. Two measures in which the authors reported no impact of aerobic exercise in PD included step cadence (SMD: -0.08, 95% CI: -0.43, 0.27) and quality of life (as measured by the Parkinson’s disease questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39); SMD: -0.13, 95% CI: -0.39, 0.13). However, as the authors note, some weaknesses specific to their PDQ-39 analysis make it hard to draw conclusions on the true impact of aerobic exercise on quality of life in PD. In particular, only four studies assessed quality of life, just one of which accounted for over 50% of data included in the analysis. This one study may have been unable to capture an impact of exercise on quality of life because their control group was an active control group, making whatever benefit aerobic exercise specifically had on quality of life marginal. That the largest study had no impact on quality of life likely had an outsized impact on the overall lack of an effect of aerobic exercise on PD quality of life. Additionally, it is likely that quality of life changes may take longer to detect than the interventions in some studies. This is supported by the fact that two of the three 24-week interventions did achieve a statistically significant quality of life improvement and that the follow up assessment in the 6-week intervention (conducted six weeks after intervention end or twelve weeks after study start) also showed a statistically significant quality of life improvement, despite the post-intervention assessment not showing a difference. However, outside of issues with the nonsignificant quality of life findings, this meta-analysis provides a valuable opportunity to highlight why exercise is so important in PD. The neuroprotective effects of exercise Beyond its role as a therapeutic for PD-related motor symptoms, exercise appears to delay or prevent disease onset, as epidemiological studies have reported that individuals with the highest levels of physical activity have the lowest future risk for PD. For instance, one study followed 143,325 individuals (mean age: 63 years) over a 9-year period and found that individuals in the highest category of weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity (e.g., jogging, tennis, stationary bike) at baseline had a 40% lower relative risk of developing PD than those not exercising at baseline. A second study extended these findings, showing that in 48,574 men and 77,254 women, the highest levels of strenuous exercise from early adulthood were associated with a 60% and 50%, respectively, PD risk reduction in later life compared to those with the lowest levels. Though these observational data are almost certainly subject to a degree of healthy user bias, mechanistic animal data indicate that aerobic exercise might support the survival of dopamine neurons, which would support the idea of a causal link and add a degree of certainty that exercise may have specific effects on the disease process underlying PD. This work has shown that aerobic exercise may protect dopamine neurons through a number of mechanisms, including increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), decreased oxidative stress, or improved mitochondrial function. This protection would result in improved motor reserve. Though this dopamine neuroprotection has only been directly demonstrated with aerobic exercise, resistance-trained rodents also show higher BDNF and decreased oxidative stress relative to controls, so it is possible that similar benefit may be conferred by other forms of exercise, which have not been studied as rigorously. Importantly, these benefits confer neuroprotection no matter whether the exercise is applied before or after animals have been induced to develop PD (typically with intracerebral administration of dopamine neuron-directed toxins). Exercise preceding administration of the toxin has been reported to result in a statistically significant reduction in dopamine cell death, while other studies (e.g., Shi et al, da Costa et al., and Tajiri et al.) have shown that exercise following administration of the toxin results in a significantly higher level of dopamine neuron survival, suggesting that exercise can also be neuroprotective even after dopamine cell death has begun. It is important to note, though, that these studies did not allow a long enough period of time for cell death to finish, and therefore do not represent neuro-restoration. Exercise may therefore be helping to protect the remaining cells rather than to restore cells that are already dead. Though these results have yet to be replicated in human studies due to serious logistical challenges (it’s prohibitively difficult to obtain both post-mortem brain tissue and exercise data on any given individual with PD), it is very possible that given the impact of exercise on slowing the deterioration of several clinical symptoms (including postural and gait instability), a similar mechanism – that of extending the life of remaining neurons – may be in place in people with PD. The bottom line Outside of medications and typical clinical care, aerobic exercise is a form of lifestyle intervention that is not prohibitively difficult to integrate in PD and has immense benefits for its symptoms. It improves motor symptoms, but could also enhance quality of life, given the exercise is of sufficiently high intensity and implemented for a sufficiently long period of time. For individuals with mild or moderate PD, aerobic exercise of even moderate or high intensity is safe and well tolerated. Those with more severe disease may still reap the benefits of aerobic exercise but should employ supervision or close monitoring during exercise to prevent injury. Other forms of exercise, including strength training and stability exercises, are also important in PD, but were not addressed in the present study. Yet even beyond the effectiveness of exercise in treating symptoms of PD, this intervention also has utility as a neuroprotective strategy that could reduce the risk of developing PD, as well as extending the lifespan of remaining dopamine neurons that are vulnerable to degeneration even after disease onset.
