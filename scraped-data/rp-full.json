    "content": "Last year I wrote a similar article so that folks could start the year off better. Be sure to check that out here.\nThe good news is that those top three tips still apply, so be sure to start there. For this year, I will get a bit more advanced for you.\n#1 Stick to a routine\nRoutine will lead to simplicity. Simplicity will lead to results. I am a huge fan of simplicity, and the only time I get away from that is for the final week or two before a contest or photoshoot. Outside of that, I believe that keeping things simpler will lead to better results than trying to overcomplicate things.\nThat is why I am a fan of meal prep and hitting consistent times not only for your meals but for your workouts as well. Dr. Mike and I have talked about this on the RP Strength Podcast a bunch of times, but there appears to be something to the idea of hitting consistent meal times throughout the day with your nutrition. This means that if you usually eat at 8am, 12pm, 4pm, and 9pm, you should do your best to stick to that throughout your diet. You can vary a bit, of course, but you should do your best to hit around those times as often as you can. It also simplifies your schedule and you have to think less about prep and planning. That way your mental bandwidth can be focused on simply executing the plan.\nWhen it comes to executing the plan, that is why I am such a fan of our two apps. The RP Hypertrophy App lays out my workouts from week to week so that I know exactly what weights, reps, and sets I need to hit. I think less in the gym and execute the plan, knowing that I am consistently hitting progressive overload and making results in the gym. The same goes with the RP Diet Coach App. It tells me exactly how much and when to eat so that I just hit the meals and get results.\nI also think that you should hit the same time of day to work out, again to the best of your ability. All this does is help teach your body what to expect and make your life simpler. I get it, stuff will happen and times will change, but I would be shocked if trying to stick to a consistent routine makes your results worse. If possible, I would also encourage you to train earlier in the day versus later. If you wait until after work, stuff happens, especially with real life, jobs, kids, partners, etc. If you can knock it out earlier and get it out of the way, I think your chances of success will increase. There are, of course, exceptions to this, but overall it is likely better to train before you get caught late at work or have to pick up your kids from their practice or game.\n#2 Focus more on your technique\nIf you are a male reading this, chances are you need to lower your weight a bit and focus more on your form and technique. Probably for ego reasons, but women tend to do much better with this in the gym. Guys tend to let their ego guide their weight choices, especially in a public gym.\nThis means that you need to focus more on your technique so that you are actually training the muscle group the exercise is intended for. If you are trying to train your biceps but are doing a pseudo hammer curl or clean, then chances are you are working your ego harder than your biceps. Drop the weight down quite a bit, get that full stretch, and go a bit slower on each rep and I bet your biceps will actually feel it. Remember, nobody else gives a crap how much weight you are lifting.\nIf you are doing one arm rows and your body is jerking around and moving more than the weight, I think you are probably not training your lats too much. Drop the weight, throw on your Versa Gripps, stretch that dumbbell all the way to the floor, and row it all the way to your chest. That is how you actually train your lats and not just jerk the crap out of a 150 pound dumbbell that impresses exactly no one.\nIt will hurt your ego a bit, but your muscles, results, and joints will thank you months and years from now.\n#3 Change your environment\nIf you struggle with snacking or staying on track with your diet late at night, then I would strongly urge you to change your environment. If you have kids or a partner who likes to eat snacks or junk food, then you need to account for this. Ideally your support system would help you out with this, but that is not always the case. If you find that seeing cookies or chips sitting out triggers you, then you need to put them away or out of sight. Hide them in the pantry or put them in some type of non see through container.\nIf you are at work and eating lunch in the breakroom smells like pizza and doughnuts, then you need to eat at your desk and make sure your meal prep is with you, or you are eating that delicious smelling food.\nIf your gym is 45 minutes away, let us face it, you are not going as often as you want to. Try a different gym or get some easy equipment to train at home. Heck, go get a Planet Fitness membership for cheap that is 10 minutes from your house instead of having to drive so far to hit the gym. I have not ever trained there, but I know quite a few folks who can get in a great hypertrophy workout at PF.\nPart of this goes back to tip #1, and by creating better systems, routines, and habits you can radically change your environment to make it simpler for you to reach your goals in 2026.\nKeep it simple, make things easier on yourself versus harder, and finally enjoy the results of your fitness journey that you have long been seeking.\nFind more from Nick Shaw on… \nInstagram: @Nick.Shaw.RP",

    "title": "20 Fitness questions before the new year",
    "url": "https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/20-fitness-questions-before-the-new-year",
    "content": "Every year, it starts a little earlier than we expect.\nSometime before Christmas, before the holidays are even over, people begin mentally planning their “New Year reset.” You tell yourself things like I’ll get serious in January or I’ll lock it in after the holidays. The intentions are good. The timing just tends to rush the thinking.\nThe problem is not that people wait until January to act. It’s that they wait until January to reflect.\nMost New Year fitness goals fail not because people lack motivation, but because they repeat the same patterns with a slightly different calendar date. More rules. More pressure. More perfection. Same frustrations by February.\nBefore the holiday meals, the fresh notebooks, and the “new year, new me” energy kick in, there is a better move.\nPause. Reflect. Get honest about what has actually been holding you back.\nThese 20 quickfire questions are not a challenge, a detox, or a resolution. They are a short reality check to help you walk into the New Year with clarity instead of guilt, and a plan instead of hope.\nTake five minutes. Read them slowly. And let this be the part of your New Year process that actually sticks.\n1. Why am I not losing weight even though I barely eat?”\nBecause “barely eating” often turns into under-eating during the day and overeating at night. Long workdays, skipped meals, and low protein earlier = nighttime hunger that feels out of control.\nThis is one of the most common patterns we see. The issue is rarely willpower. It is timing, structure, and fuel distribution.\n2.“Is it bad that I hate cardio?”\nNo. You don’t need to love cardio, and you don’t even need to do it if you do not want to. Cardio is simply a tool. For some people, it helps with fat loss, recovery, and general health. For others, it is optional and used sparingly or not at all. Strength training, daily movement, and nutrition can still drive excellent results on their own.\nIf you want to understand when cardio is useful, when it is unnecessary, and how to apply it without burning out, our free Cardio Made Simple guide breaks it down in plain language.\n3.“Why do I look bigger after I start lifting?”\nWeight changes ≠ fat gain. Your body is adapting. Lifting causes temporary water weight and inflammation, which can affect the scale or mirror before fat loss shows up. Stay consistent. The results are coming. (We promise).\nEarly lifting changes are often misleading, not negative.\n4. “Do I really need to track calories?”\nNot forever. But if you have never tracked before, guessing is probably what is holding you back.\nYou do not have to track calories to make progress. Many people eventually move away from it. But tracking can be an incredibly useful learning tool, especially early on. Most people significantly underestimate how much they eat and overestimate how consistent they are. That gap between perception and reality is often the reason progress stalls.\nTracking helps close that gap. It increases awareness of portion sizes, protein intake, calorie density, and how different foods actually add up over the day. There is a reason the phrase exists: what gets measured gets managed. When you measure your intake, even temporarily, you gain information that makes better decisions possible.\nThe goal is not to track forever. The goal is to learn enough that you no longer need to guess. Tools like the RP Diet Coach app can help guide that learning process, remove a lot of friction, and turn tracking into education rather than punishment.\nTracking is a phase. Understanding is the outcome.\n5. “Why do I lose control around food at night?”\nUnder-eating during the day + stress + restriction = night chaos.\nNight eating is often a symptom, not the problem.\nFor many people, nighttime is the first moment of the day that feels free. Work is done. Responsibilities slow down. The pressure to perform disappears. That sense of freedom naturally pairs with a desire for comfort, relaxation, and relief from stress.\nIf food has been tightly controlled all day, both physically and mentally, nighttime becomes the release valve.\nBy the evening, hunger is high, decision fatigue is real, and restraint is already worn down. What feels like “losing control” at night is often your body and brain responding exactly as they were set up to respond.\nThis is why focusing only on nighttime strategies rarely works. The fix is not more rules at night. It is a better plan for the entire day. Eating enough earlier, prioritizing protein and fiber, and reducing all-day restriction can dramatically lower nighttime hunger and urgency.\nWhen you support your body throughout the day, night eating often improves on its own. Not because you tried harder, but because you no longer needed food to do all the stress-relief work by itself.\n6. “Am I doing enough protein… or too much?”\nMost people are under, not over. If you’re guessing, you’re likely low. The RP Diet Coach app can help you here.\n Protein clarity removes a lot of frustration.\nProtein matters because it supports muscle maintenance, recovery, and satiety. When intake is too low, hunger tends to increase and progress feels harder to sustain. That alone is why protein shows up so often in successful nutrition plans.\nThat said, protein is not a magic food. Eating more protein will not automatically lead to fat loss or muscle gain if overall calories, training, and consistency are not in place. More is not always better.\nIn reality, protein needs are often lower than social media suggests. For many people, intakes around 0.8 grams per pound of bodyweight per day are more than enough to support training and body composition goals. The bigger issue is not hitting an extreme target, but knowing roughly where you stand.\nWhen protein intake becomes intentional instead of guessed, a lot of confusion and frustration disappears.\n7. “Why am I sore but not seeing results?”\nSoreness isn’t progress. Progressive overload and consistency are.\nPain is feedback. Progress is trend-based.\nMuscle soreness is not magic and it is not the key to growth. It is simply one signal your body gives you after training. Soreness can sometimes be useful as feedback, especially when introducing new exercises or returning after time off, but it should never be the primary marker of whether a program is working.\nChasing soreness often leads people to cram in as much volume as possible, assuming more pain means more progress. In reality, excessive soreness can interfere with recovery, reduce training quality, and make it harder to progress week after week. If soreness is so high that performance drops or sessions feel consistently worse, it is a sign that something needs to be adjusted.\nEffective training focuses on doing the amount of work you can recover from, not the maximum you can survive. Progress comes from gradually increasing load, reps, or quality of execution over time while staying consistent. When recovery is on point, those small improvements add up.\nSoreness can inform decisions, but it should not drive them. Sustainable progress is built on trends over weeks and months, not how wrecked you feel after a single workout.\n8. “Is walking actually doing anything?”\nYes. It improves fat loss, recovery, hunger control, and adherence. ANYTHING > nothing.\n Simple actions compound faster than perfect plans.\nWalking is one of the most underrated tools for fat loss and overall health. It is a low-intensity way to burn calories without placing a large demand on your recovery or adding significant fatigue. Because it is easy to recover from, walking can be done consistently, which is what actually matters.\nTracking steps can be especially helpful. Many people do not realize how much their daily movement drops when calories get lower, stress is higher, or fatigue accumulates. That unintentional drop in activity is a common reason fat loss plateaus appear “out of nowhere.” Step tracking provides awareness and helps keep daily movement more consistent without needing to add more intense training.\nWalking does not need to be extreme or perfect. It simply needs to be repeatable. When movement stays steady day to day, fat loss becomes easier to manage and progress becomes more predictable.\n9. “Why does my weight go up when I ‘eat clean’?”\nClean food still has calories. Sodium and carbs also affect scale weight. There are many factors to take into consideration, but tracking is a win. When you track consistently, patterns start to emerge and the noise becomes easier to ignore.\nShort-term scale changes are normal and often driven by water, digestion, and daily intake shifts, not fat gain. This is why patience matters. When you track long enough and look at trends instead of day-to-day changes, progress becomes much clearer. Trends matter far more than any single weigh-in.\n10. “Is it bad if I miss workouts when life gets busy?”\nNo. Quitting completely is worse than scaling back. What can you commit to and be consistent with it?\nMissing workouts during busy periods is normal. The problem is not doing less for a short time, it is stopping altogether. Progress does not disappear because you train less for a week or two. It disappears when consistency breaks completely.\nScaling back allows you to maintain momentum, even when life gets hectic. Consistency beats intensity every time, especially over months and years.\n11. “Why do I lose motivation after 2–3 weeks?”\nMotivation fades. Systems and habits are what carry you forward.\nMotivation gets you started. Structure keeps you going.\nMotivation is a powerful spark, but it is a poor fuel source for long-term progress. It naturally rises at the start of a new goal and fades as life, stress, and boredom set in. Waiting to feel motivated before taking action is why so many plans fall apart after a few weeks.\nLong-term success comes from habits and systems that work even when motivation is low. Simple routines, repeatable meals, scheduled training days, and clear expectations reduce the need for constant decision-making. When the structure is in place, progress can continue on autopilot.\nMotivation helps you begin. Habits are what allow you to keep going when motivation is gone.\n12. “Why do I look better in the gym mirror than at home?”\nLighting, pump, posture, and angles all play a role. Welcome to ‘Instagram VS. Reality’. Gyms are designed with bright overhead lighting, mirrors, and equipment that naturally enhance muscle definition and posture.\nWhen you get home, the lighting is flatter, the pump is gone, and you are relaxed instead of flexed. Your body did not suddenly change. The environment changed. Understanding this helps keep expectations realistic and prevents unnecessary frustration.\n13. “Am I gaining fat or muscle?”\nBodyweight is not everything. The scale alone cannot tell the full story. It is just one data point among many.\nProgress also shows up in measurements, how your clothes fit, changes in gym strength, and performance trends over time. Focusing on only one metric can hide real improvements that are happening beneath the surface. Progress is multi-dimensional, and the bigger picture matters far more than any single number.\n14. “Why do I feel hungry all the time?”\nLow protein, low fiber, poor sleep, and high stress all drive hunger.\nHunger is influenced by more than calories alone.\nHunger is not just a matter of willpower or eating more food. It is regulated by a combination of physiological, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. When protein or fiber intake is low, meals are less filling and hunger returns sooner. Poor sleep disrupts appetite hormones and increases cravings, while chronic stress raises hunger signals and lowers impulse control.\nBecause hunger has multiple inputs, addressing only calories often falls short. Improving sleep, managing stress, and building meals around adequate protein and fiber can significantly improve appetite control, even without eating more overall. When these pieces are in place, hunger becomes easier to manage and far less overwhelming.\n15. “Is it normal to be scared to eat more?”\nYes. This fear often keeps people stuck longer than food ever does.\nFear delays progress far more than fuel.\nMany people are afraid to eat more because they worry it will automatically lead to fat gain or undo their progress. Some fear gaining body fat instead of muscle. Others believe that crossing a certain calorie number will stop fat loss altogether. These fears are understandable, but they often end up doing more harm than the food itself.\nWhen intake stays very low for long stretches, it becomes difficult to maintain consistency. Hunger builds, energy drops, and sporadic overeating becomes more likely. Over time, those cycles can lead to higher weekly calorie averages than if intake had simply been a bit higher and more stable to begin with.\nEating a slightly higher amount consistently, especially while tracking, provides a much clearer long-term picture. It allows you to see real trends instead of reacting to extremes. Progress becomes easier to manage, recovery improves, and decisions can be made based on data rather than fear.\n16. “Why do I always restart on Mondays?”\nBecause all-or-nothing thinking feels productive, but it rarely leads to lasting change. Starting over on Mondays creates the illusion of control while avoiding the harder work of adjusting in real time. It encourages extremes rather than consistency, which is why progress often resets every week instead of building forward.\nReal momentum comes from staying engaged even when things are imperfect. Small actions done consistently carry far more impact than short bursts of perfection. The question is not what you can do for seven days, but what you can realistically stick with beyond that.\nMonday is not magic. Momentum is. Progress builds when you keep moving forward instead of repeatedly starting over.\n17. “Do I need to work out every day to see results?”\nNo. Recovery is part of progress, not a weakness. 3–4 days in the gym can add up to meaningful changes when done consistently. The goal is not to train as much as possible for a short burst, but to train in a way you can sustain for weeks and months without burning out.\nDoing a smaller amount of training consistently almost always beats doing a lot for a short time and fizzling out completely. Recovery is what allows adaptations to actually happen. Without enough rest, performance drops, fatigue accumulates, and progress slows or stalls.\nMore is not better if you cannot recover from it. Long-term progress comes from balancing training stress with adequate recovery so that each week builds on the last instead of digging a deeper hole.\n18. “Why does my progress disappear when I stop dieting?”\nBecause the plan was not sustainable in the first place.\nSustainability is the real finish line.\nWhen progress disappears as soon as dieting stops, it is usually a sign that the approach relied on restriction, intensity, or short-term effort rather than habits you could maintain. The plan worked only as long as you were actively pushing against it.\nLasting results come from building a way of eating and training that still works when life gets busy, motivation dips, or goals shift. The finish line is not the end of a diet. It is reaching a place where progress does not immediately unravel once the structure loosens.\n19. “Is it bad that I compare myself to others at the gym?”\nIt’s normal to compare yourself to others, especially in a gym environment where progress is visible and constant. The problem is not noticing the comparison, but letting it dictate your plan or your mood. Everyone brings different genetics, histories, goals, and circumstances to their training, so using someone else as a benchmark rarely leads to productive decisions.\nComparison is human. Direction is a choice. Progress is always you versus you, and staying focused on your own trajectory is what allows improvement to continue without unnecessary frustration.\n20. “Why does fitness feel way harder than it should?”\nBecause you’re trying to be perfect instead of consistent. Perfection demands constant effort and leaves no room for real life, which is why it often collapses under pressure. Small mistakes feel like failure, and progress stalls as a result.\nConsistency wins quietly, then all at once. Repeating simple actions over time creates momentum that perfection never sustains, and those steady efforts eventually add up to noticeable, lasting change.\n \nThe Bottom Line\nIf you read through this list and felt seen, that’s a good thing.\nYour next New Year goal does not need to be extreme.\nIt needs to be honest, realistic, and built around habits you can repeat.\nBefore you chase more motivation, clarity is the upgrade that actually lasts.\n\nFind the contributors…\nTrevor Fullbright\nIG: @Trevorxgage\n\nElizabeth Harty \nIG: @elizabethhartyy",

    "content": "Most people think dieting success comes from finding the perfect plan. The flawless routine. The ideal season of life where everything lines up and you finally have the time, discipline, and structure to get lean or gain muscle.\nIn reality, life never lines up perfectly. Kids get sick. College schedules flip every semester. Work ramps up. Training shifts. Competition seasons interrupt even the best momentum. Real people with real lives rarely have the chance to follow textbook nutrition plans.\nThis is exactly why the RP Diet Coach app exists. It does not assume you live like a robot. It adapts. It adjusts. It helps you stay consistent even when life is messy. It gives you evidence-based nutrition coaching in your pocket while meeting you exactly where you are.\nThere is no one way to use the app. In fact, five different people can get five completely different results using the same exact tool. That is the power of flexible structure. It gives you enough direction to move forward, while letting you shape the plan around your life.\nThis article walks through how different populations use the RP Diet Coach to succeed. Busy parents. College students. Fitness enthusiasts. Combat sport athletes. Bodybuilders deep in prep. Each group has completely different needs but can use the same nutritional principles to move toward their goals.\nYou will probably see yourself in at least one of these examples, and maybe a few. That is the point. Dieting and nutrition coaching do not belong to one type of person. They belong to anyone who wants to make progress without losing their sanity.\nLet’s walk through the different ways people make the RP Diet Coach app work for them.\nThe core principles \nBefore we look at specific groups, it helps to understand the shared foundation. No matter who you are, your success in the app comes from a few key principles.\nThe first is evidence-based structure. You get calories and macros that are calculated from what your body actually needs. Not trends. Not guesswork. Not what your favorite influencer claims to eat each day. Data in. Structure out.\nThe second is ongoing adjustments. Most diets fail because they are static. Your needs change weekly. Your weight fluctuates. Your appetite shifts. You train more or less. A static plan ignores all this. The app does not. It updates your macros every week based on your check-in’s and your trend.\nThe third is flexibility. The app provides structure without requiring perfection. You can adjust foods. Swap meals. Eat out. Navigate holidays. Take maintenance blocks. The plan works because it lives in the real world.\nThe fourth is awareness. The app makes adherence, scale trends, and weekly patterns visible. Most people regain weight or stall progress because they are not paying attention to the right data. Once you can see it, you can change it.\nThese principles apply to every population. But how they are used changes based on lifestyle and goals.\nBusy parents: consistency in chaos\nIf anyone deserves a system that adapts to real life, it is parents. Kids do not care about your macros. They do not care about your cut phase. They do not care if you planned chicken and rice for dinner. They care about their own needs, which change on a minute-by-minute basis.\nParents often believe they cannot make progress because they cannot control their environment. They picture dieting as long cook times, elaborate meal prep, endless tracking, and hours of planning. They think the app is for people with perfect schedules.\nParents who succeed in the app do something different. They lean into structure without needing perfection.\nHere is how parents use it.\nThey plan simple, repeatable meals. A busy parent might eat the same breakfast every day for a month because it removes decision fatigue. The app helps them lock in macro targets and reuse meals easily. No thought required.\nThey plan around chaotic windows. If evenings are unpredictable because kids need help with homework, sports, or routines, parents shift most of their protein and fiber earlier in the day. They create stability where they can, not where they wish they had it.\nThey use maintenance phases strategically. When schedules get slammed, parents sometimes switch from a cut or mass phase to maintenance. This protects progress without adding pressure during high stress periods.\nThey rely on the weekly update. Instead of worrying about one tough day, parents focus on the trend. The app helps them zoom out and evaluate the whole week instead of getting discouraged by momentary setbacks.\nWhat success looks like for parents: Slow, reliable progress without needing rigid structure. The app gives them just enough direction to move forward even when life is unpredictable.\nCollege students: structure without sacrifice\nCollege students face the opposite challenge. Their problem is not kids, but freedom. Class times change each semester. Dining hall food can feel impossible to track. Social events pop up constantly. Schedules swing from all-nighters to open days with no structure at all.\nStudents often fall into extremes. They either try to be overly perfect or they give up entirely because they cannot control everything. The RP Diet Coach gives them something they desperately need: a framework that works even when meals are unpredictable.\nHere is how students use the app.\nThey build meal patterns around staples, not perfection. Dining halls have chicken, vegetables, salad bars, eggs, fruit, and starches every day. Students learn to build macro-friendly meals using what they can reliably get. They stop worrying about exact gram accuracy and focus on consistency.\nThey use the tools to estimate macros easily. Dining hall food and takeout can feel impossible to track, especially when portions vary. The AI meal scanner helps students get quick macro estimates from photos or simple text prompts. Instead of stressing about precision, they get close enough data to stay on track without slowing down their day.\nThey choose diet phases based on academic load. During midterms or finals, many students shift to maintenance. When life calms down, they ease into cutting or lean gaining phases. The app lets them pivot cleanly.\nThey use the app like a learning tool. College students are building lifelong habits. The app teaches portion sizes, hunger management, calorie awareness, and how to structure meals. They also learn how different foods influence their satiety and energy levels. It becomes an education in nutrition, not just a diet.\nThey practice flexible social nutrition. Alcohol, late night food, and campus events are a part of the experience. The app helps students navigate these choices without feeling guilty. They learn to shift calories, plan ahead, and keep the weekly trend moving in the right direction.\nWhat success looks like for students: A realistic approach that fits busy semesters, social lives, and limited cooking options. They get progress without sacrificing their college experience.\nFitness enthusiasts: clear direction for real results\nFitness enthusiasts sit in the middle of the spectrum. They care about their training. They want to improve performance or physique. They enjoy the process. But they also have work, family, and a full life outside the gym.\nTheir biggest struggle is not chaos or lack of options. Their biggest struggle is consistency. Many enthusiasts bounce between goals. They cut for two weeks. They bulk for three. They switch to maintenance randomly. They want results but lack a clear direction and plan.\nThe RP Diet Coach gives them something invaluable: a system that keeps them honest. It gives them structure so they can move forward and flexibility so they can actually sustain it.\nHere is how enthusiasts use the app.\nThey align nutrition phases with their training blocks. Enthusiasts often run structured mesocycles, but their diet does not always match the work they are doing in the gym. The app helps them lock in clear dietary phases so their eating supports the training stimulus. \nThey use structure to avoid overshooting calories during mass phases. Many enthusiasts gain unnecessary fat because they follow a “see food” diet They think they are eating in a surplus but often drift far above what they need. The app prevents this. It sets targets based on real needs, not guesswork, which keeps gains lean and productive.\nThey rely on flexibility when life gets busy. Even dedicated lifters have weeks where work ramps up, travel interrupts routine, or recovery dips. The app lets them shift to maintenance or adjust meal timing without derailing the entire phase. They get structure without rigidity.\nThey use trends to stay accountable. When weight spikes, they do not panic. When weight drops, they do not overreact. They follow the trend and trust the weekly update. This prevents emotional decision making, which is one of the biggest reasons enthusiasts stall or yo-yo.\nThey learn what works best for their body. After a few cycles, enthusiasts understand hunger patterns, response to different foods, rate of weight change, and what foods keep them full. They start to see clear relationships between diet, training performance, and recovery. The app becomes a reflection tool that teaches them how their body actually behaves, not how they think it behaves.\nThey use flexibility and structure together. They get a plan they can follow, but they also get meal swapping, food substitutions, and the ability to adjust timing around training. The structure keeps them progressing. The flexibility keeps them sane and compliant.\nWhat success looks like for enthusiasts: Steady, measurable progress. No more guessing. No more yo-yoing. No more jumping between goals every few weeks. Just consistent movement toward a long-term outcome supported by a system that fits their life.\nCombat sport athletes: fueling performance and making weight safely\nCombat sport athletes live in a world of weight classes, high output training, long sparring sessions, and unpredictable fatigue. They need to be lean enough to make weight but fueled enough to train hard. They cannot starve through a cut. They also cannot get sloppy in a gain phase.\nThe RP Diet Coach gives them a structured way to manage all of this without going to extremes.\nHere is how combat athletes use the app.\nThey plan long-term weight trajectories. If an athlete wants to compete at 170 and walks around at 185, the app helps them diet down gradually while keeping performance intact. They avoid rushed, dangerous cuts.\nThey place carbs around training. Hard sessions get carbs before and after. Light sessions get fewer. The app teaches athletes how to time meals for maximum output.\nThey use maintenance phases to stabilize performance. During high intensity training blocks or competition camps, athletes often shift to maintenance to maintain recovery. The app supports this without losing long-term momentum.\nThey keep the weekly weight trend close to their target class. This prevents panic cutting. No athlete wants to lose 15 pounds in a week. The app keeps them within a controlled range.\nWhat success looks like for combat athletes: Better performance, safer weight cuts, predictable conditioning, and improved recovery. The app becomes part of their fight camp toolkit.\nBodybuilders in prep: precision without emotion\nBodybuilders live at the extreme end of structure. Prep is demanding. Hunger is persistent. Fatigue grows. Precision matters. There is little room for winging it. At the same time, prep is emotional. Seeing the scale stall can be stressful. Watching bodyfat come off slowly can feel discouraging. Objectivity becomes difficult.\nThis is where the RP Diet Coach shines for bodybuilders. It is a neutral, data-driven guide. It does not get impatient. It does not get emotional. It does not panic. It looks at the numbers and adjusts in a way that keeps progress moving while protecting muscle.\nHere is how bodybuilders use the app.\nThey track every macro with precision. Prep leaves no room for guessing. The app sets exact targets, and users hit them consistently.\nThey rely heavily on the weekly check in. Instead of reacting to day-to-day fluctuations, prep athletes follow the trend. The app updates macros based on real progress rather than emotional swings.\nThey use structured cuts with predictable timelines. A 16 or 20 week prep becomes easier to manage when each week has clear macro changes based on objective data.\nThey stay accountable even when hunger is high. Prep amplifies cravings and decision fatigue. The app removes decision-making. Bodybuilders do not have to wonder what to do.

    "content": "Cold weather cravings: why you are hungrier in winter and how to work with it\nThe moment the temperature drops, most people notice the same thing. Hunger spikes. Cravings get louder. Cozy foods suddenly become irresistible. The same protein shake that felt fine in August now feels like punishment, while a plate of mashed potatoes and gravy looks like salvation. If this sounds familiar, you are not broken or undisciplined. Winter appetite is a real thing, and it affects almost everyone.\nThis article breaks down why hunger shifts so much during cold months, how to understand the difference between normal cravings and true hunger, and what you can do to manage it without feeling restricted or stressed. Winter eating does not need to feel like a battle. With the right strategies, it can become one of the easiest seasons to stay on track.\nWhy winter appetite rises\nBefore we talk strategies, let’s break down why this even happens. The short version is simple. When the environment changes, your physiology follows. Winter gives your body and brain a lot of signals that drive appetite up, and none of them are your fault.\nYour body burns more energy staying warm\nThe most straightforward reason for increased hunger in winter is thermoregulation. When it is cold, your body uses extra energy to keep you warm. In extreme cold, this shows up as shivering, which burns very high amounts of calories, but even in normal winter weather your body turns up small heat production processes to keep your core temp stable. This increase is not huge, but it is enough to nudge your hunger signals.\nThink of it as a background cost. When the temperature drops, your baseline energy burn ticks up a little. Your appetite often responds to that increase, even if you are not consciously colder or more active.\nLess sunlight affects appetite hormones\nShorter days hit harder than people think. Light exposure plays a big role in appetite regulation. When daylight hours drop, your serotonin rhythm shifts. Melatonin production starts earlier and lasts longer. Both of these changes influence hunger and cravings, especially cravings for carbohydrate rich foods that feel comforting.\nThis is one of the reasons people report stronger cravings in the early evening during winter. Your body is trying to stabilize mood and energy, and carb dense comfort foods feel like the fastest solution.\nComfort foods hit harder in cold weather\nEven without biology, winter has a psychological pull toward food. Holidays, family meals, nostalgic traditions, seasonal scents, and warm dishes all stack up. If you grew up associating winter with big meals, treats, or family gatherings, those cues get triggered every season whether you realize it or not.\nOn top of that, warm food simply feels more satisfying when it is cold outside. Cold foods like salads and shakes become less appealing while soups, casseroles, rice dishes, and pastas become irresistible. That is not a willpower problem. It is a sensory preference that almost everyone shares.\nActivity levels often drop\nWinter usually means fewer steps, less outdoor movement, and less daylight for spontaneous activity. This can shift appetite in two directions. Some people feel hungrier because movement patterns change and mood dips. Others feel less hungry during the day and then experience stronger cravings at night when they finally slow down.\nThis inconsistency can make appetite feel unpredictable. One day you are fine. The next day you are ready to eat the entire kitchen at 8 p.m. Understanding why this happens makes it easier to plan around.\nHunger vs cravings: what you are really feeling\nOne of the most helpful things you can do during winter is learn the difference between physiological hunger and cravings. They show up differently and require different responses.\nTrue hunger builds slowly, feels physical, and is satisfied by almost any balanced meal. Cravings feel urgent and specific. They show up fast, often tied to mood or environment, and feel like nothing but a certain food will fix them.\nBoth are normal. Neither makes you weak or undisciplined. But knowing which one you are dealing with helps you match the strategy to the signal. You do not solve a craving the same way you solve real hunger. And you do not restrict real hunger as if it is a craving. The more awareness you build here, the easier winter eating becomes.\nSmart strategies for managing winter appetite\nWinter eating is not about restriction. It is about planning and structure that work with the season instead of fighting it. Here are the highest impact strategies that help people stay on track while still enjoying winter foods.\nWarm high volume meals\nThe easiest win in winter is switching to warm, high volume meals that keep you full without blowing up calories. Think soups, stews, chili, curries, and stir fries. These dishes are naturally higher in water content, which increases satiety, and they feel comforting and satisfying in cold weather.\nYou get the best of both worlds. Warm comfort plus high fullness.\nMake protein winter friendly\nProtein is harder to eat in cold months. Cold shakes, cold chicken, cold meal prep, none of that sounds great when you are freezing. If you find yourself gravitating away from your normal protein options, switch it up.\nGreat winter protein choices include slow cooked beef, turkey chili, bean and meat stews, lentils with eggs, and high protein soups. When protein feels warm and hearty, you are much more likely to eat enough of it, which helps control hunger for the rest of the day.\nUse winter carbs to your advantage\nInstead of fighting carb cravings, work with them. Winter carb sources like potatoes, squash, oats, barley, and whole grain pasta give you warm, satisfying meals full of fiber. They slow digestion, help manage blood sugar, and keep you full longer.\nThis is not about avoiding treats. It is about anchoring your day with carbs that support hunger control instead treats that keep you chasing the next hit.\nUse guardrails instead of strict rules\nRigid dieting in December almost always backfires. People do better with simple guardrails like calorie ranges, consistent meal timing, and a few predictable high protein meals each day.\nGuardrails keep structure in place without making the holidays feel like a punishment. If you are bulking, guardrails help prevent overshooting. If you are maintaining, they keep things stable. If you are cutting, they protect against rebound eating.\nEnjoy holiday food without guilt\nAcknowledging seasonal comfort eating is normal makes it easier to enjoy it responsibly. No one is perfect during this time of year, and perfection is not required for progress. If you want something, fit it in. If you overeat, adjust the next day and move on. Winter becomes way simpler when you stop treating food like a moral issue.\nTraining adjustments that help control appetite\nTraining plays a big role in appetite regulation, especially during winter when routines shift.\nKeep NEAT steady\nSmall daily movement goes a long way. Short winter walks, indoor steps, some quick bodyweight exercises, and stretch breaks help stabilize appetite and mood. Even 5 to 10 minutes a few times a day makes a noticeable difference.\nStay consistent with training\nTraining helps regulate hunger, sleep, mood, and cravings. In winter, consistency matters more than perfection. If you need shorter workouts or fewer exercises, that is fine. Keep the habit alive.\nPrioritize recovery\nWinter sleep gets messy. Later nights, early darkness, inconsistent schedules, holiday stress, and less sunlight can all disrupt circadian rhythm. Poor sleep increases hunger. Good sleep keeps it under control.\nThings that help include consistent light exposure in the morning, pre-bed routines, and giving yourself enough time to wind down.\nWhen winter appetite is actually a good thing\nIf you are bulking, winter cravings can be a gift. You can use the extra hunger to fuel productive training and steady weight gain. Warm, hearty meals fit naturally into bulk structure.\nIf you are maintaining, winter appetite can remind you to emphasize structure and routine.\nIf you are cutting, fighting the season is harder, but still doable with the right approach. Warm high volume foods, consistent protein, and routine become even more important.\nBottom line\nWinter hunger is normal and predictable. You are not imagining it. You are not doing anything wrong. The season itself shifts appetite, mood, and daily rhythms.\nThe goal is not to fight winter cravings with willpower. The goal is to understand what drives them and build a plan that works with the season instead of against it. Warm meals, steady protein, winter friendly carbs, better hydration, a little movement, and stress management go a long way.\nYou can enjoy comfort foods, navigate holiday chaos, and stay aligned with your goals without stress. Winter does not have to derail your progress. With the right structure and mindset, it can actually make your nutrition simpler and more enjoyable.\nIf you want extra guidance with daily structure, simple guardrails, and personalized targets that adjust automatically as your routine shifts, the RP Diet Coach App can make winter eating a whole lot easier.\n\nFind Trevor on… \nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

    "content": "The holidays are here. Time for family, fun, celebration, and a whole lot of food.\nIf you care about your fitness, this season can feel like walking through a maze of stuffing, cookies, casseroles, and dessert tables while trying to stay on track. But here is the truth. You do not have to choose between celebrating your life and supporting your goals. With the right mindset, the holidays can actually strengthen the foundation you have been building all year.\nThere is no single correct way to approach this season. Instead, there are several time tested strategies that experienced lifters and coaches use depending on their goals. Pick the one that matches your priorities right now, and the holidays become smoother and far less stressful.\nThe protein first approach\nThis is the easiest strategy to follow and works for almost everyone. Start each big holiday meal by getting a solid serving of protein. It keeps you fuller, supports muscle growth or maintenance, and sets a stable foundation before you dive into the foods you enjoy most.\nAfter that, choose the treats that genuinely matter to you. The ones that are worth the calories. The ones that only show up this time of year. You stay grounded without feeling restricted.\n\nThe 80-20 holiday balance\nThis plan is perfect if your goal is simple consistency. You keep around 80 percent of your meals nutrient dense and aligned with your goals. The remaining 20 percent is saved for celebrations, special dishes, and the moments that matter.\nThis approach is also great after finishing a diet or during a maintenance phase. You enjoy the season, but you do not drift completely off course.\n\nThe massing mindset\nIf you are in a muscle gain phase, the holidays can become a genuine advantage. Big meals, calorie dense dishes, and extra carbs all work in your favor when you pair them with consistent, hard training.\nIf you end up at a dinner with heavier foods than you would normally choose, use it. A large meal today can fuel a great session tomorrow. On the flip side, if the menu is lighter, adjust your portions and enjoy what is available.\n\nThe structured flexibility plan\nThis is great for people who want to stay mindful without feeling boxed in. You choose a few anchors to keep steady. Maybe it is protein at each meal. Maybe it is three training sessions per week. Maybe it is your normal breakfast and lunch before big dinners.\nOnce those anchors are in place, everything else becomes flexible. You can enjoy celebrations, unique foods, and time with loved ones while still maintaining some control.\n\nBuilding your holiday game plan\nThe most important part of the holiday season is deciding what you want out of it. Your strategy should match your phase and your priorities.\nAsk yourself:\nAre you in a fat loss phase?\nAre you maintaining right now?\nAre you in a muscle building phase?\nAre you mentally ready to stay structured, or do you want a short mental break?\nYour answer will determine your plan. And here is the key. None of these choices are wrong.\nA few reminders as you navigate the season\nKnow your priorities\nWhen you understand your goal for this season, it becomes easier to make choices that support it.\nStay present and enjoy the moments\nHoliday memories matter. A good meal with family or friends does not take away your progress. It adds to your life.\nDrop the guilt\nOne meal does not matter. One day does not matter. Even a week of imperfect eating will not erase the months of consistent work you have already put in. Progress is always built over time, not during one specific week in December.\nAim for better, not perfect\nIf you can stay consistent most of the time, train a few times, and keep your head in a positive place, you have won the holidays.\nThe holidays are not a setback. \nThey are a chance to practice balance, flexibility, and intention.\nApproach the season with purpose, and it will support your long term success instead of interrupting it.\nFrom all of us at RP, have a strong, joyful, and memorable holiday season.\nFind Trevor on… \nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

    "content": "Every December, more lifters lose progress stressing about missed workouts than from missing them.\nThe holidays are full of travel, family, food, and (hopefully) a bit of rest, which usually means your regular training routine gets tossed aside. Between packed schedules, unfamiliar gyms, and endless social plans, it’s easy to feel like your hard work is slipping away.\nBut here’s the truth: you can stay on track and enjoy the holidays. It just takes a little preparation, flexibility, and perspective.\nPlan ahead (just a little)\nA bit of preparation goes a long way. Before you travel, look up local gyms near where you’ll be staying. Many offer day passes or short-term memberships. Knowing your options ahead of time helps you avoid scrambling once you arrive.\nYou can also plan your training week around your travel days. If you know you’ll be short on time, schedule a deload or maintenance week to coincide with your trip. That way, you can enjoy yourself fully without feeling like you’re falling behind.\nEven a few minutes of planning can take the guesswork out of your holiday training and keep you focused on what really matters: enjoying the time, not stressing about it.\nWork with what you’ve got\nEven with the best planning, you’ll probably still end up in a less-than-perfect setup, and that’s okay. You might find yourself training in a hotel gym, a relative’s garage, or a commercial gym with unfamiliar equipment.\nEffective training isn’t about having your exact machines. It’s about stimulating the right muscles.\nCan’t do your usual bent-over rows? Try a seated cable row, chest-supported row, or dumbbell rows. No leg press? Swap in lunges or goblet squats. As long as you’re taking your sets close to failure, you’ll be just fine.\nAnd remember, not all machines feel the same. If something feels heavier or lighter, don’t worry about the number on the stack. Adjust based on your target rep range and RIR (reps in reserve). Focus on the effort, not the load.\nShort on time? Train smarter, not longer\nHoliday schedules are rarely ideal for long workouts, and that’s fine. You can get an effective session in 30 to 45 minutes with smart strategies like:\n\n\nThe goal isn’t to prove you can outwork the holidays. It’s to make movement fit your life so you can still enjoy them.\nYou don’t have to train, and that’s still discipline\nNow that we’ve covered how to make training work if you want to, let’s be clear about something else: you don’t have to.\nTaking a few days completely off won’t undo your progress. Muscle and strength loss take weeks, not days, to occur. In fact, taking time to rest, eat, and connect with family and friends can actually help. You’ll come back to the gym better fueled, more recovered, and mentally refreshed.\nIf you plan your deload or lighter week to overlap with your travel, it’s not a setback. It’s smart periodization.\nKeep perspective: Discipline isn’t all or nothing\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about holiday training is that you have to grind just as hard as usual or risk falling off. The truth? You don’t.\nMissing a few sessions, training at lower intensity, or taking a week off doesn’t mean you’ve lost your edge or your discipline. Discipline isn’t about never taking a break. It’s about showing up consistently over time, even when things aren’t perfect.\nFor most of us, the goal of training is to enhance our lives, not dominate them. The holidays only come once a year, and they’re meant for connection, reflection, and joy. You’ve worked hard all year; you’ve earned this.\nThe best athletes, and the best long-term lifters, know when to push and when to pull back. That’s not weakness. That’s mastery.\nThe big picture\nTraining during the holidays doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Whether you get full sessions in, shorten them, or skip the gym entirely, you’ll be fine.\nA few choices:\n\n\nWhat matters most is consistency over time, not perfection in the moment.\nYou’ve worked hard all year, showing up when life got busy and pushing through when motivation dipped. That effort doesn’t disappear just because the calendar says “holiday season.” A year from now, you won’t remember the sets you missed. You’ll remember the laughter, the travel, and how easily you slipped back into routine once January rolled around. The holidays don’t erase progress; they highlight why the work matters in the first place.\nNeed help making it work?\nIf you’re busy, traveling, or just struggling to find the time to plan your training through the holidays, I’d be happy to help. With 1:1 coaching, I’ll build you a personalized program that fits your schedule, keeps you progressing, and takes the stress out of figuring it out on your own.\nWhether you want to stay on track or simply enjoy the break knowing your plan is solid, we’ll make sure your training supports your life, not the other way around.\nFind Dr. Nick Harden on…\nInstagram: @drnickharden",

    "content": "The Season of Gains (and Gravy)\nIt’s that time of year again. The temperatures drop, the hoodies come out, and the idea of spending more time in the gym just feels right. For many lifters, winter means one thing: it’s bulking season. This is the time to add size, build strength, and put in the work that will pay off once cutting season rolls back around.\nEvery year people kick off their winter bulk with good intentions. Training’s consistent, calories are dialed in, and they’re ready to add some size. But once the holidays hit and the food starts rolling in, discipline tends to disappear. Suddenly it’s, “It’s cool bro, I’m bulking,” as they reach for their fourth plate of Thanksgiving dinner.\nBy the time January rolls around, the scale’s up thirty pounds, but maybe five of that is actual muscle. The rest? A thick layer of “holiday gains” that makes the next cut a whole lot longer and less fun.\nIf you want to make real progress this winter, you need a plan. The goal isn’t to stay lean and shredded, but it also isn’t to throw all structure out the window. You can enjoy your food, enjoy the holidays, and still make great progress without letting things get out of control.\nStart With a Plan, Not a Free-for-All\nA successful bulk starts with intention. Too many people call what they are doing a bulk when they’ve really just stopped tracking and started winging it. You don’t need to be perfect, but you do need some structure.\n\n\nThis kind of structure keeps you accountable. It takes some thought at the start but saves you from months of backtracking later.\nHandle the Holidays Like a Grown-Up\nLet’s be honest. You are not skipping Thanksgiving dinner, and you shouldn’t. The goal isn’t to avoid good food, it’s to manage it well. You can absolutely enjoy the holidays without turning them into an uncontrolled binge.\n\nThe goal here isn’t perfection. It’s maturity. Eat, celebrate, and move on. You’ll feel better physically and mentally if you treat holiday meals as part of life rather than an obstacle.\nKeep Training the Priority\nYour training is what separates a successful bulk from a failed one. Without consistent, hard training, those extra calories won’t go where you want them to.\n\n\nIf you use the RP Hypertrophy App, this is where it shines. The app adjusts your volume and progression based on feedback, so your training keeps evolving with your recovery and performance. When your training is on track, those extra calories are more likely to go to muscle growth.\nKeep the Bulk in Check\nYou don’t need to bulk for half a year straight. A 12 to 16-week push is plenty for most people. After that, spend a few weeks at maintenance before deciding whether to start another phase. That small reset gives your appetite, digestion, and insulin sensitivity time to recover. It also gives you a clear look at how much true muscle you gained.\nIf your waist is climbing faster than your lifts, it’s time to slow down. If you’re progressing well, your energy is solid, and your clothes still fit comfortably, keep going. Listen to your body and pay attention to performance, not just the scale.\nMini breaks and periodic maintenance phases make your gains more sustainable. They help prevent burnout and keep you motivated to train hard instead of dreading the process.\nDial in the Mindset\nA good bulk is less about food and more about discipline. It’s about being intentional with your choices. You can enjoy life, family, and food without losing sight of your goals.\nHere’s the truth: maturity in fitness means learning to live in the gray area. You don’t need to be 100 percent “on plan” or completely off the rails. Most of your meals should support your goals, and a few each week can simply support your enjoyment of life. The more consistent you are over time, the more those small indulgences stop mattering.\nWhen you focus on the big picture, the short-term stuff stops feeling like a threat. You’re not “cheating” when you eat holiday food. You’re just choosing how to make it fit. You’re not restricting when you stay mindful. You’re managing. You’re not missing out when you say no to a third dessert. You’re staying in control of what you actually want.\n\n\nThat’s how you grow real muscle this winter without blowing out your waistline. The point isn’t to diet through the holidays or go wild with food. It’s to find that middle ground where training feels strong, recovery feels great, and your clothes still fit comfortably.\nWinter bulking should be fun. It’s the season to eat hearty meals, lift heavy, and enjoy the process of building your physique. Just remember that the best gains come from consistency, not chaos.\nFinal Thoughts\nA smart bulk is about respect for the process. Respect for your training, for your recovery, and for your future self. You don’t have to choose between building muscle and enjoying the holidays. You can absolutely do both as long as you approach it with some structure and common sense.\nSo this winter, eat, train, and grow. Enjoy the season, spend time with the people you love, and build some muscle while you’re at it. Just don’t mistake “off-season” for “off the rails.”\nIf you want a little help staying on track, the RP Diet Coach App can guide your calories and macros automatically as your body changes. It takes the guesswork out of bulking so you can focus on what matters most: lifting, recovering, and enjoying the process.\n\nFind Trevor on… \nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

    "content": "Halloween is the perfect time to embrace your inner nerd, and let’s be honest, the fitness world is full of us. Behind the muscles, macros, and meticulously tracked training blocks, a lot of lifters grew up watching the same heroes: Goku screaming through another power-up, Naruto pushing through pain with nothing but willpower, and All Might reminding us that even when the odds are stacked, you still go Plus Ultra. For many of us, anime and comics weren’t just entertainment. They were lessons in discipline, grit, and transformation long before we ever picked up a barbell.\nThis Halloween, we’re celebrating the connection between anime and the iron, the training arcs, redemption stories, and over-the-top determination that inspire us to keep pushing. We asked a few coaches, athletes, bodybuilders and a special guest from the anime industry to share their own “anime arcs,” the stories that shaped how they see training, growth, and the pursuit of strength.\n\nTrevor Fullbright\nI’ve watched anime since I was a little kid. Some of my earliest memories are of sitting in front of the TV watching Dragon Ball Z, Pokémon, and Yu-Gi-Oh! Then came the Toonami days with Gundam and Trigun. Anime has always been a part of my life. But instead of growing out of it like people said I would, calling it “cartoons for kids,” I found myself connecting to it even more deeply as I got older. I related to the characters’ struggles, celebrated their victories, and tried to embody their perseverance.\nIt’s not just about fitness or training; it’s about grit, the relentless drive to keep going no matter what. Characters like Goku, always pushing to become stronger; Asta, shouting “my magic is never giving up”; and Bakugo, whose ambition burns even when it hurts him, all remind me to chase growth with everything I’ve got.\nPeople say anime is for kids, but if you watch with an open mind, you find stories packed with emotion, resilience, and inspiration. You start hearing those catchphrases in your head when life gets tough, realizing you’re not just watching for fun, you’re drawing strength from them.\nSo if anime has taught me anything, it’s this: chase your dreams, stay true to your goals, and when things get hard, remember the words of All Might: “Now, for a lesson. You may have heard these words before, but I’ll teach you what they really mean. GO BEYOND! PLUS… ULTRAAAAAAAAAAAA!”\nJorge Brites\nThe Hero’s Journey\nThis might sound silly, but like a lot of guys, a big reason I started lifting was because of comics.\nI grew up watching superheroes. There’s nothing more powerful for a kid than seeing someone start from nothing, with no powers and no privilege, and build themselves into something extraordinary. They trained, they struggled, they failed, and through that, they transformed.\nThat stuck with me.\nBut for me, it went beyond comics. Growing up in Venezuela, a third-world country filled with chaos and uncertainty, heroes weren’t just entertainment. They were hope. They showed me what was possible when everything around you felt impossible.\nI related a lot to Naruto.\nIf you know, you know. It’s not just an anime. It’s a story about resilience, pain, and purpose. Naruto was the outcast, ridiculed and underestimated. Yet he never gave up. He trained when no one believed in him. He fell, got back up, and kept pushing forward because he had a vision of the person he wanted to become.\nThat hit home for me, because at one point, I felt like that kid too.\nFitness became my version of that “training arc.” The gym was my Hidden Leaf Village, a place where I could rebuild myself one rep at a time. It gave me structure when life felt chaotic. It gave me purpose when I didn’t see a clear path ahead. And over time, it became proof that I could change my story.\nAt some point, I realized it wasn’t just about muscles or aesthetics. It was about becoming, choosing to rise up, take control, and fight for something better.\nI came to the United States with that mindset, not as the same kid who started, but as the hero I used to look up to. The one I once imagined. The one who refused to quit.\nAnd that’s what lifting, and life, really is.\nIt’s the hero’s journey, your own story of transformation.\nDr. James Hoffmann\nNeon Genesis Evangelion\nHow does one even begin to talk about NGE? It's a show with imaginative aliens, giant robots, AI governments, deep state plots to both save and destroy the world, broken families, existential crises, human sexuality, and serious Daddy issues. At first glance this looks like a sci-fi show about big robots punching aliens, but the show is really about the human need to understand, and feel understood, by others. Each character's flaws, insecurities, and personal suffering are displayed in deeply relatable ways. The show also has a confusing, but brilliant ending. The end of the 26 episode show, and the end of the movie (The End of Evangelion) which is meant to serve as the actual ending of the series, wraps the show differently. Both are interesting and thought compelling in their own ways. It's left somewhat ambiguous for you to decide which ending emotionally resonates with you.\nAlthough this show was released in 1995, I didn't end up watching it until well into my 30s. The show is deeply meaningful to me, and I often rewatch it while doing treadmill time during weight loss to add existential pain to my current physical pain. For me, the show brings up many questions in my life which I often struggle to answer: could I be better at trying to understand others, am I too wrapped up in my own insecurities, do I want to reject the world and all of its harshness or try to integrate the best I can, should I feel bad about feeling the ways I feel, are other people suffering the same ways I am, is the world rejecting me? One of the characters goes through an incredible 'fall from grace' process, going from the best in the world to completely useless. This character also subsequently has one of the biggest 'holyyyyyyy shit' displays of dominance I have ever witnessed. Its emotional impact is up there with 'Vegeta vs Android 19' (DBZ), 'Madara Vs Shinobi Alliance' (Naruto Shippuden), and 'Rock Lee Vs Gaara' (Naruto).\nRecommended Watch Order:\n First watch the 26 episode series Neon Genesis Evangelion, then watch the movie The End of Evangelion, then watch the rebooted version of the series Evangelion 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3+1.\nDC Animated Universe (1992–2019)\nOk so I know this is not anime, but it is animated so bear with me. The DC animated universe holds a special place in my heart because it has spanned a length of time from my childhood (I was born in 1986) through my adulthood. The animated shows and movies during this time are all part of a cohesive interconnected narrative. These include, but are not limited to, Batman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, Justice League, and Justice League Unlimited. Although the early shows start off in a more child friendly way, they quickly begin moving into more adult themes. It's baffling they were able to keep the storylines connected across so many shows for so many years. You can rewatch this entire catalogue, and although the animation is a bit dated, it is still incredibly compelling today. You'll find some of the most fun and interesting superhero storylines out there. To this day, I still often think about many of the movies and episodes and the emotional gut punch they often brought. In particular Epilogue of Justice League Unlimited, which served as an ending to the Batman Beyond series which never had a finale of its own, and the movie Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. These were HEAVY themes for shows aimed at children and young adults.\nWhat's brilliant and unique about the DCAU was that I grew up with it, and it grew up with me. Twenty-seven years of interconnected and increasingly deep stories. Many popular characters of today like Harley Quinn are canon to the DCAU and not the original comic books. That's how good this series is! The DCAU also often used the same voice actors for the shows, movies, and video games during this time, notably Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker. The chemistry between them was absolutely legendary. So much so that after Kevin Conroy's passing in 2022 Mark Hamill retired from his role as the Joker. Their voices are forever burned in my brain as Batman and the Joker and can never be replaced. The DCAU sparked my love for comics and anime when I was six years old, and I have never been able to put them down since.\nAndres Botero\nAnime has had a huge impact on my life, though it took time for me to truly feel it. When I was younger, I watched Dragon Ball Z like everyone else—people always talked about how Goku inspired them to train harder and push their limits. But at that age, I didn’t really understand that mindset; I just thought turning Super Saiyan looked cool. It wasn’t until I grew older and watched Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden that everything clicked. Naruto’s story taught me about real perseverance—training not just for strength, but for purpose. His loyalty to friends, his constant self-improvement, and his belief in resolving things through understanding instead of violence reshaped how I view growth, relationships, and what it means to never give up.\nJared Feather\nGrowing up in survival mode while watching the people I loved struggle day to day, especially my mother, wasn’t the easiest, and there were days I didn’t know if we’d make it. But even then, even as a kid, I decided: I will carry this. I didn’t know how, but I knew I had to become strong enough to hold the weight.\nFitness became the one place I had control when everything else was chaotic—poverty, fear, uncertainty. I could at least go to the gym and “fight back.” Rep after rep, I was building something. Maybe not a body at first. Perhaps just a shield. Something to protect the people who couldn’t defend themselves.\nSo I worked. I worked through pain, through exhaustion, and through doubt.\nBy the time I made it to university, a place I never thought I’d be, I ended up with three jobs, was full-time with school, and sent everything I earned home to my family, as I had been helping since a very young age. Every day was an internal struggle and a battle, but I didn’t win it because I was special. I won (in a sense) because I refused to lose.\nBut even now, standing on a bodybuilding stage, with all of the business endeavors, helping to change lives, people still don’t see the whole picture. They see the physique and the success, but what they don’t see is that I still approach these things like my family’s future depends on it.\nBecause it did—and maybe, in some ways, it still does.\nThis brings me to the point of all of this. I saw such a contrast in my life compared to aura farming animes (probably my favorite kind), as it is with anyone who trains lol. The training montages, the burdens these characters hold for others, and the way it shapes these characters into who they are.\nSung Jinwoo in Solo Leveling, which is a fairly new anime, is someone I have found I fully relate to.\nHe started off weak, broke, and disregarded. He works as a hunter just to survive and help his sister while trying to keep his mother alive. Sound familiar?\nEveryone wrote him off until he got a second chance—a “reawakening.” But the craziest part?\nEven after he became powerful, he never did it for himself. He kept going, leveling up, suffering, because he loved too hard to let anyone else break the way he had.\nThis anime, as well as so many others, has really motivated me through some of my hardest times. Without these sorts of “role models,” I don’t know where I would be. Because I did not have any in my day-to-day, I had to look to these characters, even if it was just for motivation to keep fighting.\nAnime truly is a phenomenal tool for anyone struggling with internal conflicts or anyone who asks themselves the hard questions in life. The stories lay out almost as their own magisterium—answers to the questions we ask ourselves in this life. Next time you encounter a problem that is eating at you, or you feel like giving up, I encourage you to give anime a shot.\nShawn Gann\nWhat an amazing outlet and representation of perseverance anime can be, huh? For myself and many others, it symbolizes overcoming obstacles, believing in oneself, and knowing that putting forth everything you can (and more) is always the right choice. Anime has meant a great deal to me throughout my whole life and different shows have helped me through different stages, as well.\nAs a child, Robotech taught me teamwork and friendship were keys in defending what you cherished, and that giant mechs were AWESOME. In college, my friends and I watched Goku in Dragon Ball Z power up over dozens and dozens of episodes to save worlds and defeat evil, never ever giving up. We also marveled at Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop and prayed we could even be a fraction as cool as him. And these days, shows like Frieren remind me how time can be so fleeting and the value of living are in the connections you make and deeds you've done. What a great gift anime has been and continues to be.\nTo the fans—Anime has been a source of joy, a fulfilling professional outlet, and a way of life for me. Whether it's directing shows like Kaiju No. 8 and The Apothecary Diaries or acting in properties like One Piece and Ranking of Kings, I find so much to love and discover. And it's all only possible because of your love and appreciation. I hope all of you out there keep supporting the artform, keep adding to its beauty, and keep believing that great storytelling can shift the world. Much love and thanks to you all!\n\nFind the contributors…\nTrevor Fullbright\nIG: @Trevorxgage\nJorge Brites\nIG: @jorge_bfitness \nDr. James Hoffmann \nIG: @rpdrjames\nAndres Botero\nIG: @broterotv_\nJared Feather IFBB Pro\nIG: @Jared_feather\nShawn Gann\nIG: @readykafka",

    "content": "By: Trevor Fullbright\nTrevor Fullbright is a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt and online coach with 13+ years in the fitness industry. A former 350-pounder turned lean 215, he combines personal experience with evidence-based methods as Head of Digital Content at RP Strength, creating expert resources on training, nutrition, and behavior change.\nWhen it comes to nutrition, people love to argue over details.\nShould you close to bed? Is rice better than potatoes? Do you need to slam a protein shake right after training or wait an hour?\nHere’s the truth: most of that stuff barely matters.\nRoughly 90% of your diet results, whether you’re trying to lose fat or build muscle, come down to just three things: calories, macros (especially protein), and meal timing. The remaining 10% comes from food quality, supplements, and hydration.\nOnce you understand that hierarchy, you can stop spinning your wheels and finally focus on what truly drives progress.\nAdherence Comes First\nBefore diving into the percentages, there’s one rule that overrides them all: adherence.\nThe best diet isn’t the perfect one on paper. It’s the one you can actually follow.\nA plan that’s 75% optimal but followed 100% of the time will always beat a perfect plan followed inconsistently.\nYou can think of adherence as the foundation that supports every other part of your diet. If you can’t stick to your calorie target, hit your protein goal, or keep a regular meal schedule, the rest doesn’t matter.\nThe goal isn’t perfection. It’s consistency. Build a plan you can live with and stick to it.\nThe 90% That Really Matters\n1. Calories (≈50% of Your Results)\nCalories are the foundation of every nutrition goal.\nIf you want to lose fat, you must eat fewer calories than you burn.\nIf you want to gain muscle, you must eat more.\nSimple, but not very sexy.\nPeople often chase magic foods or supplements, but nothing overrides calorie balance.\nEven the “cleanest” foods can lead to fat gain if you’re in a calorie surplus, and yes, you can lose weight eating “junk” food if your calories are low enough, though that’s not ideal for health or performance.\nWhat matters most is your weekly average intake.\nA few high-calorie or low-calorie days don’t matter much if your average across the week aligns with your goal. The body responds to consistent energy patterns, not individual meals.\nIf you only focus on one thing, make it this one. Dial in your calories and you’ve already done half the work.\n2. Macros and Protein (≈30% of Your Results)\nCalories decide if you gain or lose weight.\nProtein decides what kind of weight you gain or lose.\nIf your protein intake is too low while dieting, you’ll lose muscle along with fat.\nIf it’s high enough, you’ll preserve lean mass and lose mostly fat.\nDuring a muscle gain phase, protein ensures your calorie surplus builds muscle instead of just adding body fat.\nA simple, science-backed target: about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.\nThe rest of your calories can come from carbs and fats in whatever ratio fits your preference and training style. Carbs can help fuel training performance and recovery, and fat is important for hormonal health, but as long as you aren’t falling into extremes, the exact mix doesn’t matter nearly as much as hitting your total calories and protein.\nBetween calories and protein, you’ve now covered about 80% of your total diet results. Everything else is just fine-tuning.\n3. Meal Timing (≈10% of Your Results)\nMeal timing isn’t the be-all, end-all, but it can help you squeeze out a bit more performance, recovery, and consistency.\nHere’s the general structure:\n- Eat 4 to 5 meals per day.\nThis keeps you fueled, helps control hunger, and provides steady protein feedings for muscle repair.\n\n- Space meals evenly through the day.\n Eating roughly every 3 to 5 hours helps regulate appetite and stabilize energy.\n\n- Distribute protein evenly.\nIf your daily target is 160 grams and you eat four times, aim for about 40 grams per meal. This keeps muscle protein synthesis elevated throughout the day.\n\nYou don’t need to stress about exact timing down to the minute. The goal is consistency. Eating at similar times day to day also supports better digestion, sleep, and metabolic health.\nThe Remaining 10%: The Finishing Touches\nOnce the big three are set, you can move on to the smaller but still meaningful pieces of the puzzle.\n4. Food Composition (≈5%)\nThis is the quality of what you eat.\nWhole, minimally processed foods make it easier to stay full, hit your nutrient targets, and feel good overall.\nFocusing on lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats improves both health and adherence. These foods help you stay satisfied, which means fewer cravings and better long-term consistency.\nThat said, perfection isn’t required. The occasional burger or dessert won’t undo your progress as long as you stay within your calorie and protein goals. Think of it as the 80/20 principle: eat mostly nutritious foods but leave room for things you enjoy.\n5. Supplements and Hydration (≈5%)\nSupplements are the smallest piece of the puzzle, the polish, not the foundation.\nThey can fill small gaps but can’t make up for poor eating habits or inconsistency.\n\n\nAnd don’t overlook hydration. Even mild dehydration can reduce performance, focus, and recovery. Most people do best with around 2 to 4 liters of water daily, depending on body size, training load, and climate.\nTogether, food composition, hydration, and supplements make up the final 10%. They help refine and optimize but they don’t define your results.\nPutting It All Together\nIf you imagine diet priorities as a pyramid, it looks like this:\n\nWhen you understand this hierarchy, dieting gets simple.\nYou don’t need to chase perfection. You just need to execute the basics consistently.\n\n\nDo those things, and you’re already covering 90% of what matters for fat loss, muscle gain, and performance.\nBottom line:\nFocus on calories, protein, and consistency. Stick to the plan.\nLet the details fall into place, and if you need help doing that, RP has you covered.\nMake It Easier With the RP Diet Coach App\nIf all of this sounds great but you don’t want to track everything manually, the RP Diet Coach App can do the heavy lifting for you. It sets your calorie and macro targets, helps you hit your protein goals, and adjusts your plan week to week based on real progress so you can stay consistent without second-guessing.\nThink of it as your personal coach in your pocket, guiding you through the 90/10 priorities automatically.\nAll you have to do is show up and follow the plan.\nFind Trevor on… \nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

    "url": "https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/the-best-way-to-create-a-calorie-deficit-walk-run-lift-or-diet",
    "content": "By Eric Trexler, PhD\nNote: the figures in this article come from the MASS Research Review\n\nIf you’re trying to lose fat, it’s all about creating a calorie deficit. Conceptually, that’s pretty simple: move more and/or eat less. But in practice, things get a bit more difficult. When we say “move more,” are we talking about doing more resistance training, more cardio, or just more general movement throughout daily activities? What are the ramifications of altering each type of activity, and how much does each change actually “move the needle” in terms of total energy expenditure? And where does dieting come into play – should we be leaning more on moving more, eating less, or a specific combination of both? There are a lot of decisions to make (and a lot of tradeoffs for each), but fortunately we have plenty of research to guide our way.\nComponents of Total Daily Energy Expenditure\nAny discussion about creating an energy deficit requires a quick primer on energy expenditure. Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is exactly what it sounds like: the overall number of calories we burn over the course of a day. This is divided into sub-components including basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermic effect of feeding (TEF), exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT), and non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT). BMR is often referred to as resting energy expenditure (REE), whereas the other components (TEF, EAT, and NEAT) are collectively considered non-resting energy expenditure (NREE). The components of energy expenditure are summarized in Figure 1.\n\nYour BMR describes the amount of energy it takes to simply allow you to exist; that is, if you laid around in bed all day and did virtually nothing. Turns out, there’s a lot of stuff going on in your body, even when you’re pushing the upper boundaries of laziness. So, BMR typically makes up about 60-70% of daily energy expenditure. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is quite similar to BMR, and the terms are often used interchangeably despite a very subtle distinction. Measuring BMR generally requires that the individual fasts for 8-12 hours and actually stays in the lab overnight so they can be measured directly upon waking. In contrast, RMR measurement allows for looser pre-testing standards and does not require an overnight lab visit, so it tends to be a tiny bit higher than BMR. \nIf you wanted to be slightly more “active” and work a couple of meals into your bedridden day, the thermic effect of feeding would describe the amount of calories used to ingest, absorb, metabolize, and store nutrients from food. If you’re eating at a maintenance level of caloric intake, this would take up another 10% or so of daily energy expenditure, but can fluctuate if you’re eating more or less than maintenance. Depending on how much you exercise, exercise activity thermogenesis could take up a huge (or negligible) proportion of your daily energy expenditure, so assigning a percentage can be tough. It’s common to attribute about 5-10% of daily energy expenditure to exercise, but this is highly variable. That leaves us with NEAT, which describes “everything else” that burns energy. Fidgeting in your chair, vacuuming your living room, and just about any non-exercise movement gets lumped in, and it’s generally estimated to contribute roughly 15% of daily energy expenditure.\n\nNow that we know which energy expenditure “levers” exist, let’s figure out which one(s) to pull when we want to create an energy deficit.\nBurning More Calories While Lifting\nLifting weights involves muscular activity, which means we’re going to burn calories in the process. But exactly how many calories are we talking?\nIn 2021, João and colleagues measured energy expenditure during three different full-body resistance training protocols with varying set and repetition schemes. In all three workouts, participants did the same 8 exercises (chest press, pec deck, squat, lat pull-down, biceps curl, triceps extension, hamstrings curl, and crunch machine) in order. The low-intensity protocol consisted of 2 sets of 15 repetitions of each exercise at 60% of 1RM, the moderate-intensity protocol involved 3 sets of 10 reps at 75% of 1RM, and the high-intensity protocol required 6 sets of 5 repetitions at 90% of 1RM. All three protocols included two-minute rest periods between sets and exercises, so the high-intensity protocol took much longer to complete than the low-intensity protocol (116 minutes versus 44 minutes).\nWhile the high-intensity protocol led to greater absolute energy expenditure (total kilocalories burned during the full protocol), all three protocols induced pretty similar rates of energy expenditure (kilocalories burned per minute). Rate of energy expenditure was slightly lower when progressing from low-intensity to moderate-intensity to high-intensity, but all fell within the 5.3-6.5 kcal/minute range, with 6 serving as a suitable average value. However, this value will likely vary (to some extent) based on a wide range of program characteristics, such as training split, exercise intensity, rest period duration, and the exact exercises selected, among others. These minor distinctions can lead to detectable differences in the long run. For example, a 2024 study compared the effects of full-body and split-body resistance training programs with equated set volume on fat loss and delayed-onset muscle soreness. After 8 weeks, the full-body program resulted in greater volume load, less soreness, and greater fat loss. However, the magnitude of fat loss was not substantial, with the full-body training group losing only 0.775kg of fat in total.\nAt the end of the day, the goal of your resistance training program should be to induce the intended training adaptations. This involves applying an appropriate combination of frequency, volume, and intensity, while closely monitoring one’s recovery capacity and progress over time. In other words, you should design your lifting program to optimize power, strength, or hypertrophy – whatever you’re training for. Lifting is not a “calorie-burning” tool, despite the fact that calories get burned along the way. If you get too wrapped up in changing your lifting program to increase energy expenditure, you may end up sacrificing your power, strength, or hypertrophy. That’s not an advisable tradeoff, so you’re better off adjusting something else when trying to create a calorie deficit. I would only consider adjusting a resistance training program to emphasize increased energy expenditure or fat loss if I had extreme time constraints that made it impossible to incorporate other opportunities for physical activity throughout the week. In all other cases, we have better levers to pull.\nDoing More Cardio\nWhen people in the general population decide it’s time to lose a few pounds, cardio is often the first lever they pull. When you go to the gym in the first week of January, you’ll see rows and rows of treadmills full of novice joggers (and good for them – always be sure to contribute to a welcoming gym environment). But is that really the right choice for them, or for a lifting enthusiast like yourself?\nThere’s no question that cardio burns calories. When muscles generate force, they engage a multi-step process called “excitation-contraction coupling” – this describes the process of deciding to move a muscle, sending that message down the nervous system, and generating force (and then relaxing) at the muscle fiber level. Unsurprisingly, chemical energy (in the form of ATP) is used at several key steps of this process. The result is that movement causes us to burn energy, and more movement causes us to burn more energy. A massive project called the “compendium of physical activities” quantified the energy cost of over a thousand common physical activities; Table 1 shows a small selection of the estimated energy cost of key activities for a hypothetical person (180 pounds, 170 cm tall, 25 years old) exercising for an hour.\n\n\nIt’s a beautiful story – work hard for an extra hour a day, burn an extra 500 kcal/day, and there’s your calorie deficit. Unfortunately, that story unravels when you consider a pesky concept called “exercise energy expenditure.”\nBack in 2016, Herman Pontzer published the seminal paper on exercise energy compensation. His hypothesis was initially inspired by some unexpected observations he made while conducting research with hunter-gartherer populations around the world. While they were dramatically more active than sedentary Americans, their daily energy expenditures were quite similar (after adjusting for body size). This led him to develop the constrained total energy expenditure model, which posits the following: As physical activity energy expenditure is pushed higher and higher (via increased physical activity), compensatory reductions in other components of energy expenditure will increasingly serve to constrain total daily energy expenditure. This would effectively work as a regulatory mechanism that preserves body energy and opposes continuous weight loss in response to large volumes of physical activity. This directly conflicts with the “additive model,” which is our intuitive assumption that adding 500 kcal/day of extra cardio will increase your total daily energy expenditure by 500 kcal/day. In reality, research repeatedly shows that your energy expenditure will generally increase when you add cardio, but considerably less than we would mathematically predict – especially if you were already quite active before making the increase. These models are contrasted in Figure 2, which is based on Pontzer’s work.\n\nSo, what are the downsides of relying on extra cardio to create an energy deficit?\nThere are two major drawbacks. First, it’s inefficient. When you dedicate the time and effort to a cardio bout that “should” add 500 kcal/day to your deficit, adaptive reductions in energy expenditure will directly undermine your efforts, such that the deficit increases by considerably less than 500 kcal/day. In many cases, the deficit may only grow by 200-300 kcal/day – that’s a heavy tax when you consider the time and effort invested. Second, the only way to overcome this “tax” is to do even more cardio. If you’re trying to create a substantial deficit, this amount of extra cardio could absolutely start to hinder your recovery and training adaptations, in addition to consuming amounts of time and effort that become difficult to justify. There’s nothing wrong with including cardio when you’re trying to lose some fat – it can make a small contribution, and it’s a fantastic thing to do for your general health and wellness. But as an independent fat loss tool, we’ve got way better options.\nReducing Energy Intake\nI won’t bury the lede or craft a long-winded explanation for this: reducing energy intake is, by far, the best strategy for introducing a calorie deficit. Most people eat more calories than they need – this is the single best explanation for rising obesity rates over the last several decades. People are often amazed by how dramatically they can reduce their energy intake before they really start to “feel it,” as long as they’re using evidence-based strategies to navigate hunger and cravings.\nThe best approach is to start simple. Begin by minimizing your tendency to add sugar, oil, or high-calorie sauces to the foods you currently eat. Next, minimize your consumption of high-calorie beverages containing a bunch of sugar or alcohol. After that, make some easy food swaps: replace your high-fat foods with low-fat foods and replace your extremely high-carb foods with lower-carb options. Along the way, be sure to include plenty of high-fiber and high-protein foods with textures that require more chewing and a slower rate of eating. Finally, settle into a diet with “adequately palatable” foods – fairly repetitive from day-to-day, tasty enough to be tolerable, but not so tasty that you’re constantly obsessing over the next meal or snack. In many cases, these simple tips can make a difference of 1,000 kcal/day or more. They require no time, minimal effort, and shouldn’t threaten your recovery, performance, or training adaptations to the same degree as a ton of added cardio.\nOf course, there is one complication to consider: metabolic adaptation.\nMetabolic adaptation describes a group of physiological adaptations to the combination of energy restriction and weight loss, which collectively serve to oppose further weight loss. One of the most notable consequences of the metabolic and hormonal adaptations to weight loss is that our body becomes a bit more frugal with its energy use, resulting in fewer calories burned in a given day. Several studies spanning multiple decades have documented a disproportionately large drop in energy expenditure in response to weight loss diets. \nThe most pronounced effects of metabolic adaptation affect the NEAT component of daily energy expenditure. Through changes in total activity and (possibly) the metabolic efficiency of activity, reductions in NEAT appear to accompany weight loss and energy restriction. A great example of this phenomenon comes from the Biosphere 2 experiment, which is essentially the plot of a Pauly Shore movie called “Bio-Dome.” Eight individuals were placed in a self-contained dome environment, and they intended to maintain their own food supply by cultivating crops within the enclosure. They were relatively unsuccessful, so the study accidentally became a weight loss study. After two years of energy restriction, the weight-reduced participants emerged from the environment and a marked reduction in their NEAT was observed.\nConsiderable energy restriction often leads people to reduce their energy expenditure throughout the day via conscious and subconscious adjustments. Consciously, you might start using the elevator instead of the stairs, driving to places you would normally walk, or walking down to check the mailbox a couple times a week instead of every single day. Subconsciously, your friends and family might notice that you do a lot more leaning and sitting rather than standing, fidget less, use less animated gestures while talking, or that you slouch more than you used to (a postural adjustment to conserve small amounts of energy). If you happen to track your steps, you’ll often find that your daily step count drops dramatically as this process takes hold, unless you’re very proactive about keeping it stable. Evidence suggests that the combination of reductions in NEAT and exercise activity thermogenesis explain up to 85-90% of metabolic adaptation.\nSo, just like we saw with exercise energy compensation, the human body tries to use some compensatory adjustments to oppose diet-induced weight loss. However, the existence of metabolic adaptation does not mean that weight loss becomes impossible. It just means you’ll need to go a little further with your dietary adjustments to create and maintain the desired caloric deficit.\nIncreasing Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)\nNon-exercise activity thermogenesis is the component of energy expenditure that nobody thinks about, but that’s a mistake. By some estimates, variations in this unstructured activity can yield differences in total energy expenditure of up to 2,000 kcal/day. I know that sounds completely incompatible with my prior statement that hunter-gatherers and sedentary Americans often have similar energy expenditure levels after correcting for body size. As it turns out, there’s a huge factor to consider: energy intake.\nEnergy intake is relatively low by default in hunter-gatherer communities. In America, excess energy intake is the norm. Recent research has indicated that exercise energy compensation is most commonly observed when people have limited caloric availability relative to their expenditure – for example, hunter-gatherers with limited access to easy calories, elite endurance athletes who are struggling to “out-eat” their massive training volume, or people who are intentionally restricting their calorie intake. \nIn addition, I’ll note that exercise energy compensation is nonlinear in nature. If you look back at Figure 2, you’ll see that increasing from extremely sedentary to moderately active is associated with a pretty straightforward increase in energy expenditure. In contrast, the “return on investment” (in terms of increasing total energy expenditure) gets way smaller if you’re increasing from very active to extremely active. So, we shouldn’t overlook the impact of being a little more active all day long. Walking short distances instead of taking the bus, standing instead of sitting, taking the stairs instead of the elevator – all of these small decisions can add up.\nBut the most important aspect of NEAT goes well beyond its independent impact on total daily energy expenditure. The main advantage of keeping non-exercise physical activity high when trying to lose fat is that it directly addresses the only “complication” of reducing energy intake. As discussed above, our bodies have a natural tendency to reduce NEAT when we’re on a weight loss diet. So, being more active while dieting isn’t actually about trying to drive your energy expenditure up to 5,000 kcal/day. It’s all about trying to proactively offset the potential reductions in NEAT that can occur when you go on a low-calorie diet. In this regard, increasing NEAT is a very helpful strategy that serves to complement dietary restriction rather than a standalone method for creating an energy deficit. For an added pair of bonuses, being more active is also good for your health and is extremely unlikely to hinder your resistance training recovery and training adaptations.\nIn practice, maintaining an adequate level of NEAT can be pretty simple. The easiest method is to track your steps (using a smartphone or wearable device) and aim for a daily goal. Most people will select a step count target somewhere in the 10,000 to 15,000 steps/day range to keep NEAT on the higher side without going totally overboard. There’s nothing to stop you from aiming for 25,000 steps per day, but you’ll likely find that extremely high step count targets can induce a compulsion to be perpetually walking. This compulsion can negatively impact your quality of life, and the tradeoff generally isn’t worthwhile. So, pick a sensible target that works for you and be proactive about maintaining it throughout the dieting process.\nThe Verdict\nCardio is one of the single best things you can do for your general health and wellness. But when it comes to creating an energy deficit, research points to a very clear winning combination: keep your NEAT high and use dietary changes as the primary weight loss tool. For body composition purposes, lifting should absolutely be a major part of the picture. However, the vast majority of lifters should be manipulating their resistance training variables for the purpose of facilitating gains in strength, power, or hypertrophy – not to burn more calories.\n\nFind more from Eric on…\nEric Trexler, PhD\nIG: @trexlerfitness",

The truth is that obsessing over the smallest details often adds stress without delivering any extra results.\nIn that same spirit, today I want to talk about one of the most common gray areas in tracking: vegetables. Some people log every gram of broccoli they eat. Others never track a single leaf of spinach. Which approach is right? The answer is that it depends. Leafy vegetables in particular have very few calories but provide big health benefits. The key is knowing when you can safely ignore them, when it makes sense to count them, and how to make the best call for your own goals.\nWhen You Probably Don’t Need to Track\nFor the majority of people dieting for general goals, there is no real need to track leafy vegetables. If you are trying to drop a few pounds, lean out a bit for summer, or simply live a healthier lifestyle, the calories you get from lettuce or spinach are not going to make or break your progress.\nThink of it this way: if your daily deficit is 300 calories, a handful of untracked spinach in your omelet or a cup of lettuce on your sandwich is not enough to derail fat loss. Even if those veggies technically added 30 or 40 calories to your day, your deficit is still intact.\nThere are actually advantages to skipping the tracking here. Veggies add volume to your meals, provide fiber, and help keep you full. By not worrying about the tiny calories in greens, you make it easier to include more of them. More veggies equals more satiety, more micronutrients, and better long-term diet quality. That is a win across the board.\n\nIn these scenarios, obsessing over lettuce is a waste of mental energy. Your time is better spent being consistent with protein intake, meal timing, and hitting the calorie target from the foods that actually matter.\nWhen It Might Be Worth Tracking\nThere are situations where tracking your veggies does make sense. They are rare, but they exist.\nIf you are in contest prep for bodybuilding or prepping for a photoshoot, every calorie matters. You are pushing your body to extremes and leaving no room for error. At that point, even 100 calories of untracked food spread across a week can add up. It is not that veggies themselves are the problem, but that the margin of error is so tight you cannot afford any guesswork.\nThe same applies in the final stages of a long fat loss diet. Calories are low, hunger is high, and every little variable feels exaggerated. The bowl of broccoli you used to eyeball might turn into three or four cups when you are starving. At that point, logging it ensures accuracy and keeps you from accidentally eating your way out of a deficit.\nAggressive short-term diets are another case. If you are pushing for rapid fat loss, the deficit is steep and every gram counts. In those scenarios, logging veggies is a safeguard against creeping calories.\n\nIn these cases, tracking is less about the veggies themselves and more about maintaining absolute consistency across all foods.\nCalorie Density Matters\nNot all veggies are equal when it comes to calories. Having a basic understanding of calorie density can help you decide whether tracking is even worth your time.\n- Leafy greens like spinach, lettuce, kale, and arugula are incredibly low in calories. They average 10 to 25 calories per 100 grams. If you have ever seen what 100 grams of arugula looks like, you know it is basically a mountain of leaves. Overeating to the point where it actually matters would be a challenge.\n\n- Non-starchy veggies like broccoli, green beans, zucchini, and asparagus fall a little higher on the scale, usually around 20 to 40 calories per 100 grams. You could eat quite a lot before this makes a major dent in your totals, but it is more realistic to see these add up.\n\n- Starchier veggies like carrots, parsnips, beets, and peas pack more of a punch. These average 40 to 60 calories per 100 grams. Eating a big bowl of roasted carrots can quietly add several hundred calories to your day.\n\nAs a rule of thumb: do not worry about lettuce, but pay more attention if you are eating large portions of the starchier, calorie-dense vegetables.\nThe Psychological Benefit of Not Tracking\nThere is another angle here that often gets overlooked. Tracking veggies can actually backfire for some people.\nIf you see your calories as a “budget,” it becomes easy to treat veggies as a waste of that budget. You might skip the spinach in your omelet because you would rather use those 20 calories on something else. Over time, this creates a habit of eating fewer vegetables just to squeeze in more treat foods.\nThe problem is that veggies are not just filler. They provide fiber, vitamins, minerals, and a ton of health benefits. By not tracking them, you encourage yourself to eat more of them without guilt. This can make your diet healthier and more sustainable in the long run.\nThis approach works especially well in the early and middle phases of a diet, where you want to create habits that last beyond your fat loss phase. Teaching yourself to fill up on veggies without worrying about calories pays off long after the diet ends.\nHow to Make the Call\nThere is no single rule for everyone. Instead, think about it from three different angles:\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nFor most people most of the time, it is perfectly fine not to track leafy vegetables. They are too low in calories to derail your diet and too beneficial to cut back on. Tracking them only becomes useful in the most extreme situations: contest prep, aggressive fat loss, or the final grind of a long diet.\nRemember that tracking is a tool, not a rule. Use it when it benefits your results. Skip it when it does not. The smartest approach is the one that helps you stay consistent and healthy for the long haul.\nSo experiment. Pay attention to how your body responds. Find the balance that works for you, and never let a handful of spinach be the thing that stresses you out about your diet.\n\nFind Trevor on… \nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

A former 350-pounder turned lean 215, he combines personal experience with evidence-based methods as Head of Digital Content at RP Strength, creating expert resources on training, nutrition, and behavior change.\n \nIf you've ever stressed about hitting your macros to the exact gram or logging every calorie perfectly, you're not alone. Tracking apps make it easy to see numbers and charts, and that can trick you into thinking precision equals progress. Diet culture has convinced many of us that if you aren't perfect, you're failing. The truth is that perfection isn't realistic, and it isn't even necessary. In real-world nutrition, being \"close enough\" consistently beats being \"perfect\" sporadically.\n\nThe illusion of precision\nNutrition labels look exact. They list calories, carbs, fats, and protein down to the single gram. But those numbers aren't carved in stone. In the U.S., food manufacturers can legally be off by as much as 20 percent from the numbers on the label. That 150-calorie snack bar in your hand might actually be 120 calories or 180 calories. Portion sizes can vary from package to package. Restaurant meals are even more unpredictable, with studies showing that the actual calorie content often differs by hundreds from the menu listing.\nEven at home, cooking can change food weight and nutrient content. Chicken breasts lose water and fat when cooked. Pasta gains water. Oils stay behind in pans. Even if you weigh your food down to the gram, you're still starting from a number that could be off by a fifth.\nSo when you find yourself panicking over being three grams over on your carbs or five grams short on your fat, remember that the underlying numbers are already approximate.\nYour daily calorie burn isn't static\nIf intake is imprecise, output is even more so. Your calorie expenditure changes every single day. Sleep, stress, hormones, training, temperature, and daily activity all affect how many calories you burn. You might burn a few hundred more calories on a day when you're running errands, doing chores, and training hard than on a day spent mostly at a desk.\nFitness trackers and \"calories burned\" readouts can be helpful for spotting trends, but they can also be off by hundreds of calories in either direction. A watch telling you that you burned 500 calories during a workout might mean 350 or it might mean 650. Online calculators estimating your Total Daily Energy Expenditure are just that: estimates.\nPut the intake error from food labels together with the output error from wearables and calculators and you can see why trying to hit your numbers with absolute precision is a losing game. You're basing your \"precision\" on data that is imprecise to begin with.\n\n\nConsistency over perfection\nThis doesn't mean tracking is useless. It means tracking should be used for what it's good at: keeping you in the right ballpark over time. The biggest driver of fat loss, muscle gain, and performance improvements is consistency within a reasonable range, not perfection.\nBeing within a few grams or a few calories of your targets on most days will give you virtually the same results as someone who tries to be exact. In fact, people who focus on the big picture tend to stick with their plans longer because they aren't burned out from obsessive tracking. Trying to \"nail\" perfect numbers every day often leads to frustration and eventually giving up. Allowing a reasonable range helps you stay on plan for months, which is where real results happen.\nThink of it like practicing free throws. You don't have to sink every shot perfectly to win the game. You just have to keep making most of them. Over days and weeks, your small daily variations average out. The trend line is what matters, not a single data point.\nStress: the killer of physiques \nThere's one factor people often forget when they're chasing dietary perfection: stress. Ask any top bodybuilding coach and they will tell you high stress can quietly sabotage your results. Chronic stress drives up cortisol, disrupts sleep, changes appetite, and encourages your body to hold on to water.\nYou have probably seen the classic \"whoosh\" effect. Someone grinds hard on their diet, hits a plateau, then finally has an unplanned meal, relaxes for a day, and wakes up several pounds lighter. It is not magic or breaking thermodynamics; it is a combination of glycogen changes and, most importantly, a drop in stress and cortisol that lets excess water retention flush out.\nThe takeaway is that constantly worrying about perfect numbers adds to stress and can actually work against your progress. Building in mental breaks, being flexible with your plan, and actively managing stress will do more for your physique than obsessing over every gram. Relax a little, hit your ranges most of the time, and your body will respond better.\n\n\nHow to define \"close enough\"\nFor most people, being within 5–10 percent of your calorie or macro targets is more than good enough. If your goal is 2,000 calories, anywhere from 1,800 to 2,200 calories will drive essentially the same progress. If your protein goal is 180 grams, hitting 170 or 190 is fine. That cushion not only accounts for the inevitable errors in labels and tracking but also gives you breathing room to live your life without constant stress.\nThis isn't a license to \"wing it\" every day. Consistency still matters. But it shifts the goal from \"perfect\" to \"accurate enough.\" When you relax a little, you're more likely to stay on track over time and less likely to spiral if you go over by a few grams at one meal.\nPractical takeaways\nHere's how to apply the \"don't major in the minors\" mindset:\nTrack to get in the ballpark. Use apps like the RP Diet Coach app to estimate and guide your choices, not as an infallible judge.\nWeigh and log when it's helpful. Measuring food can teach you portion sizes, but you don't need to obsess over minor deviations once you have a feel for it.\nFocus on the \"big rocks.\" Getting enough protein, eating mostly whole foods, planning meals, training regularly, and sleeping well will do far more for your physique than splitting hairs over labels.\nUse ranges instead of exact targets. Think of your macros as a target zone rather than a bullseye.\nLet go of guilt. Going slightly over or under your numbers on one day won't erase your progress. What you do most of the time is what counts.\nA real-world example  \nImagine two people with the same goal. One hits 180 grams of protein, 60 grams of fat, and 200 grams of carbs every single day with obsessive tracking. The other aims for the same numbers but allows a 10 percent range. Over a month, both end up with almost identical average intake. The first person spends twice as much time and mental energy tracking. The second spends that energy training harder and sleeping better. Which one is likely to be less stressed and more consistent over the long haul?\nThe bottom line  \nProgress doesn't come from obsessing over every gram or calorie. It comes from building consistent habits and sticking to them over time. When you stop majoring in the minors, you free up mental energy for the things that actually make a difference. Eat well, train hard, sleep enough, and hit your targets most of the time. That's the real secret to sustainable progress.\n \nFind Trevor on… \nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

    "url": "https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/rp-diet-coach-app-update-top-questions",
    "content": "After months of development and beta testing the newest update to the RP Diet Coach app is finally live. Using your feedback, we’ve redesigned the app to make planning, tracking, and adjusting your nutrition smoother than ever. To help you get up to speed, we’ve answered some of the most common questions about the update below so you can take full advantage of all the changes!\n\n1. I’m not getting enough high quality protein and my green beans are being added to my protein targets, why? \nThe app has always counted lower-quality proteins in your daily totals and accounted for them in your targets. The difference now is that it’s visible to you, giving you more control over your diet. \n\nWhile some foods provide lower-quality protein, meals aren’t eaten in isolation. You have a steady flow of high-quality proteins coming in throughout the day, and proteins from different foods complement each other to fill any gaps in essential amino acids. \n\nOur protein targets also have a built-in buffer above the research-backed 0.8g per pound of bodyweight threshold (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28698222/). That means even with some lower-quality protein you’re still comfortably above the level shown to maximize muscle growth and retention.\nPrevious users might see that some of their meals that used to hit daily targets are now going above those targets. Rather than changing how you eat, go ahead and plan the rest of this week’s meals based on the amounts you want and your previous experience. Make sure to click “Save food macros” when complete. Throughout the day focus on calories and protein in your Day Balance and try to land your calories within 15% of your existing target. During your next weekly review, the app will recalibrate your targets. \n\n2. Why aren’t the macros at the top of my schedule changing when I add my meals?\nThe app isn’t just a tracker. It’s a powerful meal planner to help you stay on track. You can build and save meals ahead of time, but they don’t count toward your daily totals until you check them in.\nChecking in is the key step that confirms what you actually ate and updates your macros with real data. Without checking in, your plan stays as just a plan. Once you check in by swiping the meal on the schedule screen, it becomes an accurate record of your intake so your nutrition stays on point.\n\n3. Where are all of my custom foods?\nAll of your custom foods are still saved in the app. You can find them two ways: by searching for the food name when you’re creating a meal, or by tapping More on the home screen and opening Custom Foods. From there you can see your entire list, edit any items you’ve created, or add new ones whenever you need.\n\n4. Why aren’t things changing automatically?\nPreviously, the app took the approach of trying to optimize every change to your day so updates would happen automatically. Now changes that you make will adjust only minor things like the time of meals but not macros. This better aligns with a core RP principle of consistency over perfection while still allowing, but not requiring you to make deeper optimizations. These can be done via the “Optimize” tool which is available from the action menu on the schedule screen or via magic wand in “Edit Schedule”.  \n\nJust in case you missed it, check out our article on the latest RP Diet Coach app update for a detailed breakdown of what we’ve changed, and why.\nWe know the app has changed in a major way and it may take a moment to readjust, but we promise you, these changes were made to help improve your diet experience and success with the RP Diet Coach app. Of course, we’re always keeping an eye on feedback and working to make the app as useful as possible.",

    "content": "By: Gerald Ernat\nWhen it comes to tracking health or fitness progress, the number on the scale doesn’t tell the whole story. Two people can weigh the same but look completely different depending on how much muscle, fat, and bone they have. That’s why measuring body composition—the breakdown of fat mass and lean mass—is so valuable.\nBelow, you’ll find the most common ways to measure body composition, what each method does well, and what to keep in mind when using them.\nBioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)\nMany smart scales and devices like the InBody machine use BIA. A very small electrical current is sent through your body, and the device estimates your body fat and muscle mass based on how easily the current travels. As a Sports Dietitian for the military, I use this method daily to measure Soldiers and help them move toward their physique goals.\n\n\nResearch Spotlight:\n A study led by Dr. Grant Tinsley found that simply drinking water or standing for a while before testing could change BIA results, sometimes making body fat appear higher even though nothing about your body changed.\nDEXA Scan\nDEXA uses low-dose X-rays to separate fat, lean tissue, and bone. It’s considered one of the most accurate ways to measure body composition.\n\n\nSkinfold Calipers\nA trained professional pinches and measures fat at several points on your body, then uses those numbers to estimate body fat percentage.\n\n\nCircumference Measurements\nThis includes waist, hip, and neck measurements, or waist-to-height ratios (commonly used by the military). It’s a simple way to estimate health risks related to fat storage.\n\n\nBOD POD (Air Displacement)\nYou sit in a small pod that measures how much air your body displaces to estimate your body fat percentage.\n\n\nHydrostatic (Underwater) Weighing\nYou’re submerged in water, and your body density is calculated based on how much water you displace.\n\nProgress Pictures\nSometimes the simplest tool can be the most powerful. Taking photos of yourself regularly—from the front, side, and back—can reveal changes numbers miss.\n\n\nTip: Take photos in consistent lighting, with similar clothing, and at the same time of day (morning is best) to get the clearest view of changes over time.\nThe Big Picture: What Really Matters\nAny method can be influenced or manipulated. Drinking water, eating a big meal, wearing heavy clothes, or testing at different times of day can all change results. A single number or photo only gives you a snapshot of where you are right now. What matters most is consistency: test under the same conditions every time (morning is ideal), wear similar clothing, go to the bathroom first, use the same method or device, and take pictures in the same spot with similar lighting. Following these habits lets you see trends over time, whether you are losing fat, gaining muscle, or maintaining, without obsessing over one reading that might be off.\n\n\nStressing over a single number or photo only adds confusion. Tracking trends, measuring consistently, and being patient will give you the most accurate view of your progress.\nWhether you're trying to lose fat, build muscle, or just feel more in control of your diet, I’ll help you build a plan around your goals, preferences, and lifestyle. No rigid rules. No shame. Just clear, science-backed guidance and support.\nIf you're ready to take the guesswork out of your nutrition, I’d love to work with you.\n\n\nFind more from Gerald...\n\nInstagram: @Geraldernat",

We want to walk you through exactly why we made these changes and how they're designed to make hitting your goals easier than ever.\nWe know change can feel a little jarring at first. But by the end of this article, we think you'll see the freedom these updates give you, while still keeping you on track to make progress.\nLet's Talk About the Elephant in the Room: Calories\nIn the old RP Diet Coach App, calories weren't visible. Some people loved this. Others hated it. But here's the truth: calories were always there in the background.\nProtein and carbs each have roughly 4 calories per gram. Fat has about 9 calories per gram. You could do the math yourself, but now the app simply puts calories front and center for you.\n\n\nWhy? Because calories are the main driver of body weight change. If your calories are on point and your protein is where it needs to be, you've already taken care of about 80% of your expected diet success. Carbs and fats still matter, but you have much more flexibility in how you split them as long as your total calories and protein are locked in.\nThis shift means you can make your diet work for you, not the other way around.\nThe Weekly Calorie Goal: Your New Secret Weapon\nHere's another big change: we're shifting the focus from hitting your exact calorie target every single day to hitting it over the course of a week.\nWhy does that matter? Let's say your daily target is 2,500 calories. That adds up to 17,500 calories per week. In the old setup, every day had to be exactly 2,500. Now, you can move those calories around to fit your life.\nIf you want a little more flexibility for the weekend, you can program the app to give you slightly lower calories on weekdays and more on Saturday and Sunday. Or maybe you know you have a big training day coming up, you can shift just some calories there to fuel your training.\nIt's all about keeping the bigger picture in mind and giving you the ability to live your life without derailing your progress.\n\nSmarter, Easier Meal Adjustments\nWe also wanted to address one of the most common \"in the moment\" frustrations: being out of the house, eating something unexpected, and then trying to figure out how to make the rest of the day's meals work.\nWith the new \"Day Balance\" feature, that headache is gone.\nHere's how it works:\nTrack whatever you just ate (let's say it's a protein bar while running errands)\nPress \"Save Food Macros\" and check in your meal or just check in the food macros\nHit \"Redistribute\" on the Day Balance on the schedule screen\nThe app will take your Day Balance calories and macros and adjust your other meals automatically for you (you can tell it to skip meals you don't want affected!)\nNo more marking a meal as \"over\" or \"under\" and hoping it all evens out. The app simply recalculates so you can keep going without missing a beat.\n\n        \n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n      \nSay bye-bye to steps!\nPreviously, creating a meal meant clicking through steps 1, 2, and 3 to pick your proteins, fats, and carbs, which was clunky, time consuming, and often made it hard to log everyday foods like a banana if you were in the wrong step. Now, all of that is gone and you can add any food to a meal from a single screen, making meal creation faster, smoother, and more intuitive than ever. With the removal of steps, the app also tracks every macro from every food so there are no more odd discrepancies between name brand and generic entries, and all macros for an item are now counted automatically, giving you more accurate and consistent data across your diet to help you make better decisions, manage your intake with confidence, and get even more from your results.\n\nEating Windows and Busy Times\nWe also updated how the app handles your daily routine. The old sleep schedule feature is gone, replaced with a simpler and more flexible system.\nNow you can set up eating windows, the times of day you are available or willing to eat. You can also block off busy periods when eating is not possible, like a daily meeting, your commute, or your actual sleep time if you work an unusual schedule.\nThis gives you more control over your plan and makes it easier to match the app to your life. Whether you are an early riser, a shift worker, or someone who wants meals scheduled around work and family, the app now adjusts to you, not the other way around.\n\nWhy These Changes Matter\nAll of these updates, including calories front and center, weekly calorie goals, and auto-balancing, are about the same thing: making it easier for you to stick to your plan consistently.\nBecause here's the truth: perfection is not what gets results. Consistency does.\nWhen you have flexibility, you're less likely to \"fall off\" after a single high-calorie day.\nWhen you can plan ahead for weekends or special events, you stop feeling like you have to choose between living your life and reaching your goals.\nWhen you can make adjustments on the fly, you can stay on track no matter what the day throws at you.\nThese changes remove some of the friction that used to make dieting feel harder than it needs to be. And when the process feels easier, you're more likely to stick with it long enough to see real results.\nWhat This Means for Your Progress\nIn the past, some users got caught up in hitting daily macro targets so precisely that they forgot the real goal: changing their body composition in a way that's sustainable.\nBy putting the focus where it matters most, calories and protein, we're giving you the tools to make your diet fit your lifestyle without losing sight of the fundamentals that drive results.\n\n\nCalories and protein set the foundation for your results. Carbs and fats fine-tune your performance, recovery, and overall satisfaction with your diet. Adjust them to fit your preferences and training demands while keeping your foundation in place.\nGetting Started with the New App\nIf you're already an RP Diet Coach user, you'll see these changes right away.\nCheck your Schedule: Your daily calorie and macro targets and meals will be front and center.\nSet up your week: Decide if you want even daily calories or to shift them for certain days.\nTry out the day balance tools: The next time your day changes unexpectedly, give the day balance tools a spin to easily adjust your meals to hit your day targets.\nTake a few days to get comfortable, and don't be afraid to experiment. The flexibility is built in to help you succeed, not stress you out.\nFinal Thoughts\nWe've been working on these updates for a long time, and they're based on years of coaching experience and research into what truly drives results. The RP Diet Coach app is now more flexible, more user-friendly, and more in line with how real people live and eat.\nWe're excited to see how you use these tools to make your diet work for you and, as always, we're here to help you every step of the way.",

    "content": "By: Dr. Derek Wilcox\nDerek Wilcox, PhD, is a sports physiologist and performance coach who helps clients of all levels improve body composition, strength, and longevity through evidence-based training, nutrition, and biomechanical assessments. As the U.S. Army’s Head Powerlifting Coach and a multi-sport competitor, he blends science, compassion, and practical strategies to deliver adaptable, results-driven coaching.\n\nThe Narrowing Window of Fitness Success After 35\nTry to find a more frustrated and annoyed group than people over 35 who exercise and diet consistently without making progress toward their body composition and performance goals. Go ahead. I’ll wait.\nIf you really want to see their frustration level spike, have someone in their 20s explain how simple the process is “based on the science.” Technically, they are correct: calories in versus calories out still drives weight gain and loss. Resistance training is the key to gaining muscle. Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates remain the main nutrients to focus on, with vitamins and minerals in supporting roles. The difference is that the context changes with age, and that is the kicker.\nWhen Reality Hits After Your 20s\nAnother favorite point from younger people is that research shows chronological age is not the main driver of metabolic dysfunction, being less active is. Completely true. Except, once you get past your college years, reality hits hard and responsibilities grow fast.\nStress builds as you search for a career that pays the bills and maybe start a family. Personal and professional priorities shoot up the hierarchy of needs and quickly consume the time you once had for exercise. Early on, youth still covers the cracks. But through your 30s those stressors add up, and both psychological and physical stress accumulate.\n\n\nSedentary Habits, Sleep Loss, and the “Oh No” Moment\nMany jobs now involve long hours sitting or repetitive short-range motions that tighten joints and cause chronic pain. Add kids to the mix and you sit even more, sleep less, and watch stress hormones rise while nutrition and exercise take a back seat for years.\nThe result: more body fat, less muscle, and hormones drifting far from optimal. Your mind assumes you can bounce back like before, until that first semi-athletic movement that ends with a strained hamstring, tweaked back, or popped shoulder. Reality has arrived.\n\n“This Is Normal” Isn’t Good Enough\nOne of the worst blows comes at the doctor’s office. Many people in this situation hear, “Yes, this is normal as you get older.” Not only are you expected to accept these new circumstances, you’re told not to expect much improvement.\nYet the basic prescription remains the same: lift weights or do general exercise, eat a better diet, and rest. The hard truth is that sometimes your body simply will not respond like it did in your youth. Hormones may not bounce back naturally. This is dysfunction and should be addressed with your medical team.\nHormones are critical for healthy psychological and metabolic responses. Dysfunction quickly becomes a quality-of-life issue. Common treatments include estrogen and progestin for women, and testosterone, thyroid, or growth hormone therapies for men and women with anti-aging goals. Eating fewer calories and lifting weights cannot work as intended if your hormones are off. “Calories out” is drastically different now. Pressing the same button on a machine with broken wiring does not fix the hardware.\n\n\nWhy Coaching Matters More With Age\nThis is where an educated, experienced coach can save you time and wasted effort. People in their youth have a wide window of strategies to lose fat and gain muscle. As we age, that window narrows. Recovery slows, injury risk rises, and tissues are less pliable. You need a calculated, efficient approach for nutrition and exercise.\nMy primary role with most clients is to strip away fluff and unnecessary steps so more time and energy remain for work and family responsibilities.\n\n\nThe Hidden Cost of Sacrificing Yourself\nOne of the biggest mistakes I see is people sacrificing their own health, thinking it is righteous to give that time to family or career. In the short term, it makes sense. In the long term, it erodes your ability to give energy to everything else.\nDeclining physical health, energy, and strength means you have less to offer the people and projects that matter. Maintaining your capacity to contribute in all areas of life is exactly what you invest in by staying in shape. Lean muscle mass is strongly correlated with survivability and lifespan. If you let yourself get weaker and out of shape, the chances rise that you will not be around, or will not feel well enough to achieve your goals or enjoy time with family. They deserve the best version of you, and you owe it to them to make that effort.\n\nThe Physics Stay the Same, the Context Changes\nYes, technically, the rules do not change because physics is a thing. Physiology follows physics. But the context changes as we age. We must use more efficient, detail-oriented methods for staying in shape and building the bodies we want.\nAll this work pays off far beyond aesthetics. The ability and capacity to perform your best for yourself and others cannot be taken for granted. It must be earned. Your return on investment in your health is exponential, and nothing else in life gives a payoff quite like it.\n\n\nReady for Guidance That Fits Your Life?\nIf you’re tired of spinning your wheels trying to do what used to work, consider working with a knowledgeable coach who understands the unique challenges of training and eating well after 35. My 1:1 online coaching is designed to help you cut through the noise, stay accountable, and finally see the results you’ve been working for, all while fitting your plan into a busy life.\n\nFind Dr. Wilcox on..\nInstagram: @wilcoxstrengthinc",

    "content": "By Eric Trexler, PhD\nEric Trexler is a Lecturing Fellow at Duke University where he teaches and conducts research related to exercise and nutrition. He is a former strength coach and pro natural bodybuilder who has published over 60 peer-reviewed papers about getting bigger, stronger, leaner, and healthier.\n\n\nCaffeine is everywhere. It’s the most frequently consumed psychoactive substance on the planet, it’s regularly consumed by over 80% of American adults, and in some cultures average daily intake exceeds 400 mg/day. It’s been used for thousands of years across numerous cultures. It was briefly a banned substance, then made a remarkable comeback. All in all, caffeine has had an interesting life, and it’s currently riding high on a wave of popularity.\nFigure 1: Average daily caffeine intake by country\n\n\nCaption: Image source: https://journals.lww.com/co-lipidology/fulltext/2007/02000/coffee,_caffeine,_and_coronary_heart_disease.5.aspx\nPublished research framed caffeinated beverages (namely coffee) as harmful in the 1980s, but research flipped that perspective entirely by the early 2000s. Over the last several decades, parallel research has linked pre-exercise caffeine with improved performance. Unlike most supplements, caffeine has been shown to improve a wide range of performance types including aerobic endurance, sprints, strength, muscular endurance, and power. It also improves subjective focus and perceived energy during workouts while reducing perceived exertion – no wonder it’s the primary ingredient in just about every pre-workout supplement on the market.\nHaving said that, caffeine research is constantly evolving. I’ve published research papers and textbook chapters about caffeine and have generally framed it in a categorically positive light. But in recent years, a few key findings have caused me to revise some of my conclusions and add some major caveats to others. So, let’s dig into the newest caffeine research to discuss caffeine’s pros, cons, and most justifiable use cases.\n\nWho Stands to Benefit From Pre-Workout Caffeine?\n\nCaffeine has been studied for over a century, yet its exact performance-enhancing mechanisms remain debated. Early theories focused on peripheral effects, such as catecholamine release and increased glycolytic flux, but these explanations fail to consistently account for caffeine’s ergogenic impact. Similarly, the idea that caffeine improves performance by enhancing fat oxidation and sparing glycogen is incomplete, particularly for high-intensity strength or power exercise where glycogen isn’t the limiting factor. Another proposed mechanism—boosting sodium/potassium pump activity—has shown inconsistent evidence and doesn’t appear to drive strength outcomes.\nCurrent consensus points to caffeine’s action on the central nervous system, particularly its antagonism of adenosine receptors (A1 and A2A). By blocking adenosine, caffeine reduces perceived exertion, increases alertness, and helps sustain motor unit firing, all of which support force production and fatigue resistance. Importantly, research on electrically stimulated muscle contractions in quadraplegic patients—where central nervous system involvement is minimized—shows caffeine still enhances muscular endurance, suggesting additional peripheral mechanisms, likely related to increased calcium release within muscle. In short, while adenosine antagonism is the primary mechanism, a secondary role for muscle calcium handling likely contributes, making caffeine’s benefits applicable to both endurance and strength exercise.\nFigure 2: How caffeine works\n\nThat’s all great, but there’s one problem: caffeine metabolism and adenosine receptor production vary based on your genes. The CYP1A2 gene codes for the CYP1A2 enzyme, which is responsible for metabolizing ~95% of caffeine in the liver. The ADORA2A gene codes for the adenosine A2A receptor. Changes in wakefulness, pain perception, and a variety of other physiological effects result from caffeine blocking this receptor. Intuitively, researchers have wondered whether or not these specific genes ultimately impact caffeine’s performance-enhancing effects. If so, then caffeine would only be viewed as an effective supplement for a percentage of the broader population.\nA 2020 review identified 11 studies investigating the effect of CYP1A2 genotype on caffeine’s ergogenic effect during aerobic exercise. Of those 11 studies, only two reported a significant effect, with both indicating that carriers of the “C” allele had smaller performance improvements in cycling time trials of fairly long durations (10-40km). Eight studies investigated “high-intensity” exercise, such as strength, muscular endurance, sprinting, jumping tests, agility tests, and sport-specific exercise tests. Of those eight studies, only two reported a significant effect. Both reported very modest differences indicating that carriers of the “C” allele had slightly smaller performance improvements in some of the performance outcomes measured. Overall, it seems that having one or more C alleles for the CYP1A2 gene may slightly attenuate the ergogenic effect of caffeine, but it doesn’t mean that carriers of the C allele will have no ergogenic response at all. In addition, the effects reported in this research are small and inconsistent.\nFor ADORA2A, there is far less literature available. A very small pilot study sampling 12 women found that caffeine significantly improved 10-minute cycling time trial performance in the group of women with the TT genotype (n = 6), but not in the group of C allele carriers (n = 6). A separate study by Carswell et al. (8) investigated the impact of CYP1A2 and ADORA2A genotypes on 15-minute cycling time trial performance. Caffeine significantly enhanced performance in all genotypes by about 6-8%, with very similar values among all CYP1A2 and ADORA2A genotypes. Grgic and colleagues carried out a study in a sample that only included carriers of the C allele for the ADORA2A gene (9). While this impaired their ability to compare effects between genotypes, it allowed them to determine whether or not the C allele prevented participants from enjoying an ergogenic effect from caffeine supplementation. They analyzed 25 different performance variables including a wide range of strength, sprint, jump, and muscular endurance tests. Caffeine significantly improved performance in 21 of the 25 tests, and the size of these improvements was very consistent with the broader caffeine literature with mixed-genotype samples. Based on the totality of the evidence, carriers of the “C” allele still seem to enjoy performance benefits, and it’s too early to conclusively suggest that they experience smaller effects than individuals without the “C” allele.\nOverall, the idea that CYP1A2 or ADORA2A genotypes have a large, consistent impact on caffeine’s ergogenic effects seems to be losing steam – but that doesn’t mean everyone experiences the same effects from caffeine. There are a huge number of factors that may alter caffeine metabolism, such as smoking, estrogen levels, menstrual cycle phase, oral contraceptive use, obesity, a wide range of prescription drugs, habitual caffeine consumption, and the consumption of alcohol, flavonoids, apiaceous vegetables, grapefruit juice, brassica vegetables, and charred meat. But even beyond these inter-individual differences, recent research surprisingly shows us that the performance effects of caffeine can be very hit-or-miss, even among people who sometimes experience \npositive effects.\n\nVariability of Performance Benefits\n\nIn a 2022 study by Tamilio and colleagues, 22 male rugby players completed a series of exercise tests under caffeine and placebo conditions—three sessions each, for a total of six sessions. This setup essentially repeated the same experiment three times in the same group, allowing the researchers to assess how consistent the caffeine effect was within individuals. On average, caffeine improved performance for countermovement jump, drop jump, and repetitions to failure. But here’s the kicker: even though the protocol, dose, and timing were identical across visits, the effect sizes ranged from trivial to large. So while caffeine “worked” overall, the day-to-day response was highly variable, even within the same person doing the same test.\nThat variability could stem from a bunch of things: random measurement error, daily fluctuations in fatigue or motivation, or just plain old biological noise. It’s hard to say exactly. But this kind of variability means we need to be cautious when interpreting caffeine studies and when interpreting our personal response to caffeine. Unfortunately the response we get on Tuesday isn’t necessarily the response we can expect on Thursday. And, more importantly, we have to consider the long-term effects of caffeine use if we really want to predict how much performance enhancement we can realistically expect to observe.\n\nDuration of Caffeine Use\n\nThe first time you had a tall cup of coffee, you might have felt invincible (or uncomfortably jittery). But have a few cups daily and you’ll find that those amplified responses become increasingly muted over time – this is called habituation, and it shows how our body “gets used to” caffeine over time, ultimately dulling our responsiveness for certain outcomes. Over time our massive changes in wakefulness, heart rate, and blood pressure may fade, but do we retain our performance benefits?\nYou’ll find a lot of conflicting information on this topic, mostly because there are two very different ways to approach the question. One method is to invite people to participate in a study and ask them how much caffeine they typically use. With this approach, it’s very clear that self-reported caffeine users still get performance benefits in response to pre-exercise caffeine injection. However, this approach relies heavily on self-reported assessments of caffeine dose, frequency, and regularity.\nA more straightforward approach involves actually giving people a standardized caffeine dose daily for weeks on end and measuring their performance effects along the way. Very few studies take this approach for obvious reasons – it involves a lot more time, labor, and money. But it’s the only way to truly tackle the question head-on. \nA 2019 study by Lara and colleagues studied the ergogenic effect of pre-exercise caffeine supplementation (3mg/kg) over a 20-day period. The results generally suggested that the magnitude of caffeine’s ergogenic effect decreased with repeated use. However, the relative degree of effect size reduction varied among the different performance outcomes measured, and an effect size getting smaller is not the same as an effect size disappearing entirely. It’s also unclear if the effect sizes were on a trajectory involving continuous decreases over time, or if the effect size reductions had effectively plateaued at a lower (but still non-zero) magnitude of performance enhancement. \nFigure 3: Ergogenic effect of caffeine can shrink (but not disappear) over time\n\n\nOverall, research seems to suggest that caffeine’s performance-enhancing effect shrinks with daily consumption, but doesn’t fall all the way to zero. But here’s another important question: does it matter?\nWe don’t really train for the sake of having good workouts. We train to induce training adaptations – to become bigger, faster, stronger, and so on. It doesn’t really matter if regular caffeine use still provides a tiny performance enhancement in the gym if that enhancement fails to translate to better gains over time. Crazy as it sounds, there are surprisingly few studies that actually measure this directly.\nOne such study, published in 2021, randomly assigned 16 resistance-trained, caffeine-naive participants to ingest caffeine (3mg/kg) or a placebo prior to workouts over the course of a four-week bench press training program (12 total workouts). The training program involved sets of 8-10 repetitions using 60-70% of 1RM and was designed to maximize increases in peak velocity and power using intermediate loads. The caffeine group made slightly better improvements in bar velocity and peak power across a wide range of loads from 10% of 1RM to 100% of 1RM, and they made very slightly larger increases in bench 1RM. However, these effects were not large enough or consistent enough to be considered statistically significant. More research is needed, but the best available evidence suggests that habitual pre-workout consumption of caffeine may have effects ranging from neutral to small (but positive).  \nFigure 4: Effects of regular caffeine supplementation on strength gains over time\n\n\nTiming of Caffeine\n\nOn one hand, caffeine timing is simple. Research shows that taking caffeine 30-60 minutes before exercise can improve performance across a wide range of physical tasks. Caffeine also stays in your system for several hours, so there’s no harm done if you have to take it 90 or even 120 minutes beforehand. However, there’s also a pretty major drawback to caffeine’s slow clearance.\nCaffeine already has a half-life of around 5-6 hours, on average. In other words, it already takes a long time to leave your system, which can pose a major threat to the quantity and quality of your sleep. A common myth is that caffeine only messes with your sleep if you consume it late in the evening. In reality, recent research suggests you’d need to take any substantial dose of caffeine (>200 mg) at least 13 hours before bed to confidently avoid sleep disruption. It’s hard to overstate how important this is – caffeine’s potential benefits on training adaptations are tiny, whereas sleep disruption can lead to impaired recovery, impaired performance, loss of lean mass, impaired appetite regulation, and difficulty losing fat. \n\nIf you’re still not sold on restricting your caffeine use to the morning hours, another line of research might win you over. A group of researchers investigated the ergogenic potential of three different caffeine doses (3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, or a 0 mg/kg placebo) at two separate times of day (morning versus evening) in female handball athletes. Caffeine was most effective at improving performance when ingested in the morning, and 6 mg/kg was generally more effective than 3 mg/kg. Evening caffeine ingestion did not significantly improve performance and was associated with more side effects, especially when the higher dose (6 mg/kg) was ingested. If you’re keeping score at home, caffeine in the late afternoon or evening is losing across the board: no performance improvement, greater side effects, and impaired sleep. Not exactly a great sales pitch for a hypercaffeinated preworkout formula. \n\nWhat About Novel Forms of Caffeine or Caffeine Alternatives?\n\nA novel trend in the caffeine world involves making attempts to extend caffeine’s effects. For example, some studies have investigated the use of threacrine instead of caffeine – theacrine has similar effects on the body, but a much slower half-life. This means it enters the system a bit more slowly but circulating levels in the bloodstream remain higher for longer. Similarly, a fairly new addition to the supplement market includes dual-release or triple-release caffeine products that offer an immediate, sustained, and/or delayed form of caffeine. The goal of these products is to provide an initial elevation of circulating caffeine, but to sustain that elevation for a more prolonged period of time than normal caffeine.\nThese sound like cool, creative ways to make a good thing better, but I’m not into it. In my opinion, this is making a flawed (but useful) thing worse for most lifters and athletes. As I mentioned earlier, caffeine has a long half-life and lingers in your system for a while – too long, in my opinion. As a result, large caffeine doses should be restricted to the morning hours. After all, caffeine’s benefits are very small in magnitude – the modest upsides of pre-workout caffeine are dramatically outweighed by the downsides of sleep disruption.\nIf I had it my way, I’d fork over extra money for a version of caffeine with a dramatically shortened half-life, but certainly not a dramatically extended half-life. But there are, of course, exceptions. When you’re trying to use caffeine to improve performance in a 60-minute workout, a shorter half-life is clearly preferable. But if you’re doing an all-day event requiring peak performance across a several-hour window or completing a multi-hour military mission in an underslept state, those are clearly scenarios where a longer half-life would be clutch.\n\nConclusions\nPlenty of evidence suggests that caffeine, dosed at 3-6 mg/kg of body weight and taken 30-60 minutes before exercise, improves a wide range of performance outcomes including endurance, power, and strength. However, it’s very important to contextualize the performance-enhancing potential of caffeine. Its effects on performance are pretty variable, whether you’re comparing between individuals or comparing day-to-day effects for a single person. Its benefits appear to shrink (but not disappear entirely) when you lean on it daily. Its acute benefits (observed directly after consumption) may help you get a better workout, but its chronic impact on actual training adaptations (i.e., strength and muscle gains) are smaller than you might expect. In addition, it only appears to work when taken in the morning, and consuming it too late in the day can increase the likelihood of side effects and sleep impairment.\nWith this in mind, pre-workout caffeine consumption makes the most sense when you’re trying to: 1) facilitate the transition from afternoon or evening training to morning training, 2) preserve performance in a training session or competition occurring in an underslept state, or 3) occasionally boost your subjective enjoyment of training sessions. This is quite different from the common assumption that caffeine will provide a perpetual, reliable enhancement of performance whenever you happen to use it. Caffeine isn’t useless, but its effects are commonly overhyped and its drawbacks are often overlooked.\n\nFind more from Eric on…\nEric Trexler, PhD\nIG: @trexlerfitness",

Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, the 2018 World's Strongest Man and absolute unit, teamed up with Dr. Mike Israetel to find out what this whole \"hypertrophy training\" thing is all about.\nThor can practically lift a gym, so you'd expect him to be pressing crazy weights, right? Well, compared to us mortals, that's still true. But compared to his own strongman standards, this session was about something different: taking strength-based lifts and tweaking the technique so they build maximum muscle. That shift brought Thor into a whole new world of pain.\nTogether, they ran through a chest and arm workout designed to show how simple cues can turn your go-to exercises into brutal muscle builders.\n\nUpper Chest Destruction\nThe workout started with incline dumbbell presses. Instead of grabbing the heaviest bells in sight, Dr. Mike had Thor focus on getting the pecs to do the work. Each rep was lowered into a deep stretch, with the dumbbells coming all the way down to his front delts. Thor paused there briefly before pressing back out of the hole. That emphasis on stretch, control, and slow eccentrics transformed the movement from just a heavy press into a precision chest shredder.\nTurning push-ups into weapons of mass?\nNext up was the humble push-up—the exercise most lifters forget about once they get under a barbell. But done the RP way, it's no afterthought. Thor elevated his hands to sink deeper into the stretch, kept his hips slightly up, and lifted his chest to open things up even more. With a controlled lowering phase and a full one-second pause at the bottom, the push-ups turned savage. Watching a giant like Thor struggle through reps was proof enough: these aren't just a warm-up.\n\n\nCrushing skulls with barbells\nFor triceps, it was time for barbell skullcrushers. This wasn’t just about banging out reps, but really owning the technique. Thor slowed the eccentric, took the bar as low as he could manage, and worked to keep his elbows tucked so the triceps stayed under tension. With arms as massive as his, he could sink these deep, and Dr. Mike made sure every rep counted. Whether you take the bar to your forehead, behind your head, or lower toward your nose or chin, the principle is the same: take it all the way down, stretch those triceps, and chase the pump.\nWrapping it up with biceps \nFinally, the session ended with one of RP’s favorites to cook your biceps: the facing-away cable curl. With the cables pulling his arms behind him, Thor got an enormous biceps stretch before curling under full tension. Dr. Mike added myorep-style work here, pushing Thor into the kind of pump that leaves your arms cramping. It got so bad Thor couldn’t even grab a drink without his biceps locking up. Thankfully, the RP athlete manager was on hand to save him from dehydration!\n\nWhy this training hits different  \nThor could walk into any gym, pick up nearly any weight, and toss it around. But what made this workout special were the cues Dr. Mike gave him. The focus wasn't on just surviving the set, it was about leaning into the pain and making the muscles do the work. Slowing down the eccentric, pausing in deep stretches, and pushing close to failure maximizes growth without wasted effort. \nAnd here's the kicker: if it works for a world-class strongman like Thor, it'll work for anyone chasing size, strength, and serious pumps.\nTry it yourself\nWant to see how it all went down? Check out the RP x Thor chest and arm training video for the full breakdown. But fair warning: when you train this way, you'll feel it for days.\n\nIf you're ready to bring the same science-backed approach into your own training, the RP Hypertrophy App is built on these exact principles. Every program is designed around progression that actually drives results. You don't need to be the World's Strongest Man, you just need the right plan.",

    "content": "By Dr. Derek Wilcox\nDr. Derek Wilcox, PhD in Sport Physiology and Performance, is the US Army Head Powerlifting Coach and a record-setting powerlifter. A longtime RP coach, he combines world-class competitive experience in multiple sports with advanced academic expertise to deliver science-backed, results-driven coaching for athletes and everyday clients alike.\n\nA Unique Opportunity\nThis year I had the opportunity to combine several of my passions into one unforgettable experience. In the spring, I was offered an adaptive powerlifting coaching position with the US Army, and I couldn’t have been more excited.\nMy father served in the Army during Vietnam. My career as a professional powerlifter consumed my life for many years. The focus of my PhD studies was adaptive powerlifting. Somehow, all of these paths intersected and led me to the Warrior Games.\nWhat Are the Warrior Games?\nYou can watch coverage of the Warrior Games Powerlifting event on Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, or the Department of Defense website:\nWatch the event here\nFrom the Department of Defense Warrior Games website:\n\nEvents include archery, cycling, field events, indoor rowing, powerlifting, precision air sports, sitting volleyball, swimming, track, wheelchair basketball, and wheelchair rugby.\nWhy This Program Matters\nHaving a goal to work toward can be the difference between truly living or simply existing. We all need direction, and this program is incredibly valuable, especially after seeing it in person.\nBeing goal-oriented has driven me in my academic career and my own training for competition. That mindset deeply resonated with me, and I wanted to give these soldiers my absolute best to prepare them for competition.\nEntering Military Culture\nBefore this role, I had never worked directly with the military. There was an adjustment period—learning the culture, the structure, and the endless acronyms I didn’t understand at first.\n\n\nOur staff and soldiers were quick to help. In many ways, they did for me what I was there to do for them: guide me toward success. Everyone was easy to work with, committed, and willing to do whatever it took to make things run smoothly. I was deeply impressed with the discipline and attitude of the Army across the board.\nPreparing for the Games\nAfter the Army Trials in April, where team selections were made, the big competition arrived in July in Colorado Springs.\nAdaptive powerlifting is different from traditional powerlifting, as it’s bench press only. The bench is a full table with Velcro straps to secure lifters for maximum stability. This design creates as level a playing field as possible for athletes with a wide range of disabilities.\n\n\nThe rules are also slightly different. The head judge only gives the start and rack commands. The coach stands beside the bench and calls “press” when the bar is motionless on the chest, according to the rules.\nCompetition Day\nOn the day of the event, I was nervous. These soldiers had trained hard, and I wanted them to have every opportunity to succeed. My nerves disappeared quickly thanks to the other coaches.\nCoach Steve Bortle and Coach Brent Garlic had our lifters perfectly prepared in the warm-up area. Our fearless leader for Team Army, Coach Adriane Wilson, managed the board and attempt selections with precision. This allowed me to focus completely on the competition floor, helping athletes into position, handing off the bar, and coaching each lift.\nResults That Matter\nOur soldiers rose to the occasion. They lifted with discipline, intensity, and pride. Team Army earned eight medals in powerlifting: three gold, three silver, and two bronze.\n\n\nI couldn’t be prouder, not just of the results, but of their spirit, which embodied the mission of the Warrior Games.\nThe day had its lighter moments too. At one point, I had to chase down a double amputee carrying his prosthetic legs. That’s not something they teach you in coaching school.\n\n\nLessons and Gratitude\nIt was an honor to work with our soldiers and alongside such an incredible group of coaches. I leaned heavily on their advice and experience. When you have the opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants, you take it, not just for yourself, but because you owe it to your athletes.\nI left this competition a different person than when I arrived, grateful for the experience and inspired by the athletes I had the privilege to coach.\nI’m already looking forward to the next Warrior Games in 2026.\nUnlock your full potential with 1:1 coaching from Dr. Derek Wilcox. With decades of competitive experience and advanced expertise in sport physiology, Derek delivers personalized, science-backed programming designed to help you build strength, improve performance, and achieve your goals, whether you’re training for competition or chasing personal bests.\n\nFind Dr. Wilcox on..\nInstagram: @wilcoxstrengthinc",

    "content": "By: Joe Sullivan\nJoe Sullivan is a world-class powerlifter, competitive bodybuilder, and highly respected coach known for his technical expertise and raw intensity both on and off the platform. A former all-time world record holder and one of the strongest pound-for-pound squatters in history, Joe brings over a decade of elite-level experience to his work with lifters of all levels. Through his coaching, content, and mentorship, he helps athletes build not just strength but also confidence, resilience, and purpose.\n\n\nPowerlifters Are Movement Economists\nThe goal in powerlifting is simple: move the most weight possible using the most mechanically efficient and often shortest range of motion allowed by competition rules. It’s not a flaw in thinking; it’s the nature of the sport. But that mentality often bleeds into training in ways that might be holding lifters back.\nTake the bench press lockout, for example. If a lifter struggles here, the typical go-to solutions are board presses, Spoto presses, or other partial range variations targeting that specific portion of the lift. This kind of targeted overload makes sense within the competitive context of powerlifting, but it misses a broader opportunity, one that full and extended range of motion training can provide.\nThe Case for Full and Extended Range of Motion\nTraining through a full range of motion with deliberate eccentrics and pauses at lengthened positions has long been championed in hypertrophy-focused communities, particularly by RP Strength. But in the world of strength sport, these practices are often misunderstood or dismissed entirely.\nThat needs to change.\nWhen you expose connective tissue, muscle, and joint structures to controlled, extended ranges of motion under load, like taking a hack squat well below competition depth or pausing a dumbbell press with the handles below the chest. You don’t just build muscle. You build resilience. You create robustness in your tissues. You increase your capacity to withstand technical breakdowns under maximal loads, where the margin for error is razor thin and the difference between a tendon staying attached or rupturing violently can come down to a few millimeters.\nWhat Strength Athletes Can Learn from Bodybuilders\nNo, you don’t need to train like a cyborg with a five-count eccentric on every rep, or develop mobility that rivals a gymnast. But you do need to understand that bodybuilding principles like full range of motion and positional intent are not just for aesthetics. They are performance tools.\nSpending time in deep, controlled positions helps buffer your joints and connective tissues against catastrophic failure. It improves proprioception and increases usable mobility. It helps you adapt when things go wrong, which, on the platform, they often do.\n\n\nWill an extended ROM dumbbell press translate to your bench lockout like a two-board press might? Maybe not directly. But it will make your pecs, rotator cuffs, and tendons far more durable when you’re pressing one hundred percent of your max after a long pause.\nThis is not about abandoning specificity. It’s about supporting it.\nBridging the Divide\nThere’s a strange tribalism in strength training.\nPowerlifters speak the language of specificity and efficiency.\nBodybuilders speak the language of control and contraction.\nBut at the end of the day, we all want the same thing. We want to train harder, longer, and better without breaking down.\nIf both camps were willing to step outside their dogma and view training through a shared lens, we’d all be better for it. Full range of motion training is not anti-strength. It supports longevity, adaptation, and performance.\nPersonal Reflection\nI was self-coached for most of the first decade of my lifting career as I pushed toward elite totals and began entering the conversation as someone to watch. After placing second at the US Open in 2017, Chris Duffin from Kabuki Strength reached out and invited me to join their team.\nAt the time, I was already familiar with Kabuki’s movement system, which draws heavily from DNS principles and other biomechanical schools of thought, so I went all in with their coaching. I’m incredibly grateful for that period. It shaped a lot of how I think about movement.\nEven as I moved beyond them and sought out other avenues, that drive to learn, grow, and expand my knowledge remained.\nStill, even as I broke my first all-time world record in 2020, I had been dealing with persistent issues. Repeated pec strains. Chronic knee pain. I was doing everything I thought was right, but something still wasn’t clicking. I knew how to work hard, how to push, how to chase perfect execution. But I had hit a ceiling I couldn’t see past.\nThen I moved to Las Vegas with my partner, Brianny, and started periodically training with Jared Feather, someone I now consider a brother.\nI had always respected the RP school of thought. Their focus on methodical execution, volume management, and the value of slow tempo work aligned with my own approach. I had used slow eccentrics regularly in a powerlifting context to build skill. But I didn’t fully understand how profoundly these principles could change the trajectory of my training.\nI began applying those techniques: slow eccentrics, pauses in the stretched position, full range of motion execution to movements powerlifters often relegate to the accessory bin. At the same time, I reduced my weekly frequency on the big three to once per week.\n\nThe rest of my volume came from movement patterns that mimicked the competition lifts. Squat, press, and hinge patterns, but done with a bodybuilding approach. Machines, dumbbells, cables. All with strict tempos and intentional contractions.\nWhat happened next changed everything.\nI went on to break a long-standing world record seven more times after 2020. And I did it while training in the most pain-free state I had ever experienced as a powerlifter.\nFor years, I had been caught in the trap of overvaluing specificity. Only when I took a step back and focused on the foundations of movement—tissue quality, range of motion, execution—did I unlock a new ceiling for myself and for the lifters I now coach.\nA Lesson Learned Late\nI didn’t escape the wear and tear of 17 years at the top of powerlifting. The damage was done, and ultimately, I had to step away. But I am unbelievably grateful for the second wind I found during those last few years. At a time when I thought my career was over, I was able to climb the mountain again and again.\nI’ll never stop preaching this message:\n\nIf I had embraced these full ROM principles earlier, the kind you’ll find all over the RP Strength YouTube channel and training systems. I believe I could have added years to my career. I would have built more muscle. I would have been more resilient. I could have competed longer in the sport I love.\nBut this isn’t about trading your compound lifts for a cable curl. It’s about giving yourself the best chance to stay in the fight. To stay strong. And to stay standing year after year, cycle after cycle, competition after competition. And push the limits of what we all think possible again and again.\nFind Joe on… \nInstagram: @joesullivan_aod",

    "content": "By: Trevor Fullbright\nTrevor Fullbright is a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt and online coach with 13+ years in the fitness industry. A former 350-pounder turned lean 215, he combines personal experience with evidence-based methods as Head of Digital Content at RP Strength, creating expert resources on training, nutrition, and behavior change.\n\nA quick story from the mats\nAt 5:30 a.m. the lights flick on at The Forge BJJ and a handful of groggy-eyed regulars shuffle across the cold mats. Most mornings I’m one of them, because somewhere along the way “drill before dawn” stopped being a decision and turned into something closer to tying my shoes. No checklist, no debate, just autopilot. The same idea applies to fat-loss nutrition: if we turn the right choices into reflexes, the plan keeps running on the days motivation sleeps in.\nWhy checklists crumble when life gets loud\nClassic dieting advice looks a lot like a whiteboard: weigh the chicken, log the carbs, hit the macros, check the boxes. That framework feels productive while energy is high, but research on self-control shows conscious restraint drains quickly under stress, fatigue, or social pressure. Re-creating that “perfect day” again and again becomes a mental tax few athletes can pay forever. When the cognitive account runs empty, the strict plan collapses and progress stalls. Sustainable success needs a system that survives decision fatigue, and that system is habit.\nHow habits shoulder the heavy load\nHabits are context-triggered behaviors stored in procedural memory, which means once they’re installed they operate with little to no deliberation. A landmark tracking study from University College London followed volunteers repeating a chosen health behavior daily and found the median time to reach near-automaticity was sixty-six days, with individual ranges stretching from eighteen to 254 days. Two months of repetition may sound boring, but it buys years of ease\nHigh-self-control individuals don’t white-knuckle cravings better than the rest of us. Large-sample analyses show that the link between trait self-control and goal success is fully explained by well-established habits. In other words, people who appear disciplined actually rely on routines that sidestep temptation altogether. Willpower sparks the routine; habit runs the engine.\n\nProof that habit-based programs out-perform “usual care”\nPrimary-care clinicians in the United Kingdom tested a leaflet called Ten Top Tips that teaches patients to rehearse ten simple cues such as “walk while you talk” or “swap sugary drinks for water.” In only three months the leaflet group lost almost a kilogram more than patients given standard weight-loss advice, and the advantage was still visible two years later, despite the intervention costing less than a pair of lifting straps.\nA separate cohort study of post-menopausal women found that long-term weight maintenance depended less on the kilos they dropped in the first four months and more on how deeply they embedded new eating behaviors into everyday life. The lesson is clear: the deeper the habit groove, the longer the results last. In other words, progress isn’t about slamming the pedal to the metal on day one; it comes from patiently turning deliberate choices into reflexes and steering daily cues toward long-term goals instead of short-term cravings.\nFlexible structure outperforms rigid rules\nWhat happens when we compare two popular dieting mindsets head-to-head? A twenty-week randomized trial assigned resistance-trained adults to a rigid meal plan or a flexible macro template. Both groups dropped similar fat during the ten-week diet phase, but only the flexible eaters added lean mass without regaining fat during the unsupervised follow-up. Flexible restraint allows athletes to adapt their food choices to real-world contexts, such as social dinners, travel, and fluctuating appetite, while preserving a calorie deficit. Rigid restraint, by contrast, often fails all at once when a single rule is violated.\nTranslating the science into daily rhythm\nWhen I coach a client through a cut, I resist the urge to hand them a fifty-item task list. Instead, we pick one keystone routine and rehearse it until it feels as reflexive as brushing teeth. My personal starting point is anchoring protein: a palm-size lean source at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Once that runs without thought, we layer the next practice like a half-plate of fibrous veggies or schedule a ten-minute walk right after each meal. By stacking routines in a fixed order and context (the same pan on the stove, the same sidewalk loop at lunch), we teach the brain a reliable script.\nOver time the individual habits link together into what behavioral scientists call a “chunk.” Rather than five separate tasks, the sequence fires as one smooth action: log breakfast, brew coffee, sear eggs, prep greens, step outside for a walk. There’s no checkbox because there’s no choice point; the cue triggers the script.\nDesigning an environment that nudges the script\nEnvironment beats motivation nine times out of ten, so I treat the kitchen like a weight room. The whey tub and shaker bottle live beside the coffeemaker, where I’ll see them at dawn. Grocery delivery is locked for the day bulk-cooked proteins run out, so I’m never without food ready to go before I find myself speed dialing pizza delivery. \nThese tweaks look trivial, yet each removes a moment of friction. Fewer obstacles mean more reps; more reps accelerate the sixty-six-day clock.\nBringing it all together\nThe data make a simple argument. Checklists and rigid rules lean on willpower, which is limited and fickle. Habits outsource the same behaviors to neural circuitry that doesn’t tire. Evidence-based programs like Ten Top Tips show small cues practiced daily beat comprehensive advice delivered once. Flexible guidelines preserve muscle and sanity better than rigid meal plans. Your environment can add or subtract friction; smart design makes the desirable action the default.\n\n\n\nYour next eight weeks\nPick one routine you can repeat without fail. Maybe it’s protein anchoring, or a post-meal walk, or logging before the first bite. Commit to that sole practice for eight weeks. Track your streaks and adjust calories on a weekly, not daily, basis. When the habit feels automatic, when you catch yourself doing it without inner debate, then layer in the next behavior. Keep stacking until the sequence hums beneath your day like a well-tuned engine.\nBy the time holiday cookie trays appear, your habits will be steering the ship. Progress will read more like the morning mats at The Forge: lights on, tie the belt, start moving, no checklist required.\nFind Trevor on… \nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

    "title": "What Injury Recovery Taught Me About Nutrition",
    "url": "https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/what-injury-recovery-taught-me-about-nutrition",
    "content": "By: Dr. Stacie Barber\nI Thought I Knew What Recovery Meant Until I Was the One on Crutches\nAs a physical therapist, I’ve spent my career helping others navigate the recovery process. I’ve rehabbed athletes through post-op setbacks, managed nagging overuse injuries, and guided people back to the sports and lives they love.\nBut nothing prepared me for the emotional and physical challenge of healing my own body.\nWhen I ruptured my Achilles tendon, I thought I could “out-discipline” the injury. I couldn’t train like I used to, so I figured I’d take the opportunity to lean out. I cut my calories, tightened up my food choices, and treated my nutrition like a cutting phase. I assumed that injury meant inactivity, and inactivity meant I needed fewer calories.\nWhat I didn’t realize was that healing is one of the most metabolically demanding things your body can go through. I was starving myself right when I needed fuel the most.\nHealing Is Not a Passive Process. It’s Demanding Work\nBeing in a boot and on crutches made me feel like I was doing nothing. But beneath the surface, my body was doing everything.\n\nThese aren’t passive processes. They require energy. They require nutrients. They require intentional fueling.\nI didn’t fully grasp that until I realized I was actually regressing. My rehab sessions felt harder than they should have. I was constantly exhausted. I couldn’t build tolerance to load. My sleep suffered. My mood plummeted. The discipline I thought I was showing by eating less was actually stalling my recovery.\nUnder-Fueling During Injury Doesn’t Just Slow Healing. It Risks Everything\nHere’s what I now know, not just as a PT, but as a patient.\nWhen you under-eat during injury recovery, you put yourself at risk for muscle loss, especially if the injured limb is immobilized or non-weight-bearing. Tissue repair suffers because tendons and ligaments need adequate calories, amino acids, and micronutrients to rebuild. Low calorie intake can also suppress thyroid function and increase stress hormones like cortisol, leading to hormonal disruption that impacts everything from energy to mood. On top of that, your nervous system becomes more reactive and less resilient, increasing your sensitivity to pain. And mentally, being in a calorie deficit during a tough recovery makes it even harder to stay positive.\n\n\n\nI experienced every single one of those before I finally adjusted course.\nWhat Helped Me Finally Start Healing\nI didn’t just start feeling better—I actually started healing—when I increased my food intake.\nAt first, I moved to caloric maintenance, then eventually added a small surplus, especially on rehab days or when my activity level increased. But the biggest shift came from prioritizing protein.\nI increased my daily protein intake to around 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of bodyweight, spread across the day. That gave my body what it needed to preserve lean mass, repair tissue, and support my immune system.\nI also stopped fearing carbohydrates. Instead of viewing them as something to minimize, I saw them as fuel for my therapy sessions. They helped stabilize my energy levels and got rid of the constant sense of “flatness” I had felt during the early weeks of eating less.\nWhat I Ate While Recovering\nOnce I stopped under-eating, my meals became simple, consistent, and supportive of healing.\nBreakfast was usually a mix of eggs, oats, berries, cottage cheese, and a scoop of collagen peptides. Mid-morning, I’d have a snack like an apple with peanut butter. Lunch might be chicken thigh with jasmine rice drizzled in coconut oil, followed by a banana and whey protein in the afternoon. Dinner was typically steak, a roasted sweet potato, and whatever vegetable I had in the fridge.\nIt wasn’t fancy. It wasn’t perfect. But it was enough. And that made all the difference.\nProgress Looks Different During Injury. But It’s Still Progress\nOne of the hardest parts of recovery is redefining what progress means. It’s easy to get wrapped up in aesthetics, scale weight, or chasing personal records. But recovery is about something deeper—restoring function, rebuilding tissue, and regaining confidence in your body.\nFueling your body during this time doesn’t mean you’re letting yourself go. It means you’re giving yourself the best possible chance at a full, strong return.\nThe turning point in my recovery wasn’t a new rehab technique or some fancy tool. It was the moment I stopped trying to restrict and started trying to support. That shift—from control to care—changed everything.\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you’re injured right now and tempted to cut calories or “tighten up” your diet to compensate for less movement, I get it. I’ve been there. But trust me—your body is doing some of the most important work it’s ever done.\nIt needs fuel.\nIt needs protein.\nIt needs you to show up and support it, not punish it.\nLet yourself heal. Eat enough to rebuild. You’ll be stronger for it.\n\nFind more from Dr. Stacie...\nInstagram: @thephysiofix",

He is a former strength coach and pro natural bodybuilder who has published over 60 peer-reviewed papers about getting bigger, stronger, leaner, and healthier.\nShould you take creatine?\nSince around 1992, lifters have answered with a very confident “yes.” But we’ve learned a lot about creatine since then, and a surprising amount of that learning has occurred in the last couple years. So, let’s take a closer look at the most important takeaways from recent creatine research.\nWhat Does Creatine Do?\nOur cells need chemical energy to do their jobs. But not just any chemical energy – adenosine triphosphate (ATP) specifically. When you go on vacation to a country halfway around the world, you often need to exchange your native currency for whatever is used in that faraway land so you can pay for goods and services. In the human body, you need to convert your energy to the correct currency as well. Whether you traveled in with carbs, protein, fat, or ketones, you’ll need to transfer that over to ATP in order to make cells work. \nThere are numerous biochemical pathways to facilitate those transfers; some make the transfer very rapidly, and others take more time. High-intensity exercise like lifting weights and sprinting requires large amounts of ATP over very short periods of time. So, we have to use our most rapid source of ATP production – the phosphocreatine system – to produce ATP rapidly. During intense muscle activity, your muscles are churning through ATP, breaking it down into ADP. When this occurs, phosphocreatine (stored in the muscle) swoops in to donate a phosphate group which converts ADP back to ATP to fuel further muscle activity. Later on (when there’s less of an energy crunch), the resulting creatine will grab an extra phosphate group to “recharge” and become PCr again.\n\nOur muscles contain stored phosphocreatine, but for most people, storage isn’t totally maxed out. By supplementing with creatine, we top off our phosphocreatine, maximizing our short-term energy production. The result is that you fail a couple reps later or complete that sprint a second or two faster.\nDoes Creatine Make Your Muscles Bigger?\nGiven how creatine works, it’s no surprise that creatine reliably improves strength and power outcomes. A tremendous volume of research indicates that creatine reliably improves strength (e.g., your one-rep max), power (e.g., repeated sprint speed), and muscular endurance (e.g., reps completed before failure).\nThat’s all great - but does it actually make your muscles bigger?\nThat may sound like a silly question, but it’s worth asking. We can’t always assume that a short-term strength or power improvement will translate to a long-term difference in muscle growth. In addition, creatine supplementation is known to increase total body mass and lean mass, but it’s also known to increase total body water. Water weight could theoretically be anywhere – increased plasma volume, a bloated gut, you name it. Simply looking at changes in body weight or lean mass won’t actually tell us if muscles got bigger. Which brings us back to our prior question: does creatine actually make your muscles bigger?\nAccording to a 2023 meta-analysis, the answer is yes. Burke and colleagues analyzed the results of 10 studies that took direct measures of muscle size after at least 6 weeks of creatine supplementation (combined with resistance training). The results indicated that creatine increased muscle science, with a small (but non-zero) effect size of 0.11 standard deviations. In more relatable units, they found that muscle thickness increased by roughly 10-16 millimeters on average. With gains of such a small magnitude, we don’t exactly need to create a separate bodybuilding category for the mass monsters using creatine. Nonetheless, those modest gains are coming from a very affordable and very safe supplement, and they can add up over longer time scales.\n\nDoes Creatine Make Your Bones Stronger?\nGiven creatine’s remarkable track record for improving muscle-related outcomes, researchers intuitively wanted to know if creatine could also have positive effects on bones. It’s not a crazy idea. Bones use energy and adapt to the forces imposed by resistance training, so why wouldn’t a supplement that boosts energy production and allows for more forceful resistance training help out?\nThat’s very intuitive logic, but always remember: some true things don’t make sense, and some things that make sense aren’t true. According to a recent meta-analysis by Forbes and Candow, creatine comes up short when it comes to boosting bone density. To be clear, creatine does no harm to bones, it just isn’t bringing anything valuable to the table. Looking at bone density of the total skeleton, lumbar spine, and femoral neck (hip), all three showed virtually zero effect of creatine supplementation.\nIn summary, don’t believe all of the hype about creatine. It’s great for muscle, but it’s not meaningfully impacting bone.\nDoes Creatine Improve Brain Health or Function?\nThe human brain is the crown jewel of evolution, and it’s a calorie-burning machine. Think about it this way – fitness enthusiasts often talk about building more muscle to boost their resting energy expenditure. While muscle burns 13 calories per kilogram of tissue per day, brain tissue burns a staggering 240. In other words, if one pound of muscle burned as much energy as one pound of brain tissue, the average adult man’s resting metabolic rate would increase by about 7500 calories.\nAnd your brain doesn’t just need energy – it specifically needs creatine. There’s an entire group of medical conditions known as cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes. These inherited conditions impact your brain’s ability to produce or transport creatine, and the ramifications are severe. Individuals with cerebral creatine deficiency often experience intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, and movement disorders. So, given the clear need for creatine in the brain, it seems like creatine supplementation is a surefire strategy for brain health and function… right?\nAs it turns out, the answer is a bit complicated.\nOne complicating factor is dosage. For muscle-building goals, the typical creatine dose required to maintain maximized muscle creatine storage is around 5 grams per day (or 0.07 grams per kg of body weight). For people who are just starting creatine (and in a hurry to saturated muscle storage), a common approach is to load ~20g per day (split among 4 doses) for a week to speed up the process, then drop back down to a maintenance dose. This will allow you to saturate muscle creatine levels in about a week (rather than the 3-4 week timeline you’d expect with a daily maintenance dose), but is a bit wasteful and may increase the likelihood of stomach discomfort. A less common middle ground approach, which I call “semi-loading,” involve taking ~10g per day (split among two doses) to fully saturated muscle creatine in about two weeks, then drop down to a maintenance dose of ~5g/day.\nA typical maintenance dose (~5g/day) doesn’t seem large enough to meaningfully impact brain creatine levels. So, if you’re hoping to derive any brain benefits from creatine, you’ll need to be consuming more than the typical lifter. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with that, but consuming larger doses per day may increase the likelihood of mild stomach discomfort and definitely increases your annual creatine budget.\n\nA second complicating factor is context. If you’re a young, healthy person eating a balanced diet, your brain works well. In such a scenario, we wouldn’t expect creatine to do much at all for brain health or cognitive function, which are already satisfactory. But when those “typical” circumstances are out the window, creatine may provide some benefits. As reviewed in a 2021 paper, emerging evidence suggests that creatine may be able to boost brain function in conditions that contribute to energy crunches in the brain. These include sleep deprivation, creatine synthesis enzyme deficiencies, mild traumatic brain injury, aging, Alzheimer's disease, mental fatigue, acute stress, depression, and aging.\nBut when it comes to creatine’s effects on these brain-related outcomes, there are three catches. First, this research is relatively new. A common phenomenon in research is for early studies on a new topic to seem particularly positive, followed by a wave of less exciting studies that extinguish the optimism. Whether or not that wave is coming is not yet known. Second, the positive studies to date indicate that you need a larger creatine dose to impact these brain-related outcomes. Conservatively you’d need around 10 grams per day (or 0.14 g/kg), but you may need as high as 20 grams per day (or 0.28 g/kg). In that case, we’re talking about opting in to a 100-300% markup above the “market price” for your typical creatine habit. A third, just to reiterate – the positive brain stuff has only been observed when the brain is actually in some sort of “deficit” – an artificially manipulated scenario that intentionally puts your brain into a scenario of suboptimal function. If you think you’re going to take some creatine and instantly notice massive cognitive benefits compared to your normal day-to-day function, you’ll be sorely disappointed.\nSpeaking of creatine and the brain, let’s get ahead of one myth in the making. A recent pilot study (that is, a very small and very preliminary study) found that creatine very slightly improved symptoms among people with Alzheimer’s disease. There has also been some interest in using creatine to manage symptoms of some other neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease. This work is cool and valuable, but prone to misinterpretation. To be abundantly clear: no one has provided any evidence to suggest that creatine can prevent these conditions. They merely hope that creatine may partially attenuate some of the neurological and cognitive deficits after the disease has already progressed to the point of being symptomatic.\nFinally, let’s address one area where big questions remain. Vegetarians (and especially vegans) often have larger positive responses to creatine supplementation in studies evaluating strength and power. This is because vegetarians tend to have lower muscular creatine levels at baseline (due to lack of creatine food sources in the diet). When a vegan and an omnivore take creatine for 8 weeks, the vegan will often experience a larger increase in storage because of their lower baseline level, which translates to better performance improvements. But does this translate to brain-related outcomes as well?\nSo far, it doesn’t seem to. Evidence to date suggests there is little to no difference when comparing brain creatine levels in vegetarians and omnivores. It’s very possible that brain creatine levels are simply too important (and therefore too tightly regulated) to allow for deviations based on dietary choices. One study is used frequently to suggest that vegetarians get a better memory boost from creatine than omnivores, and it’s cited time and time again. The only problem is that it didn’t find that at all. \nThe classic study by Benton and Donohoe reported that vegetarians had a “better” response to creatine than the omnivores. But if you read the fine print and dig into the results, you find a very curious result: creatine (or the passing of time) somehow made omnivories dumber. After creatine supplementation, omnivores’ scores on the cognitive task got worse, whereas vegetarians stayed roughly the same. This study does not indicate that vegetarians improved because they bolstered brain creatine stores that were low at baseline – it implies that creatine somehow impaired the cognitive function of omnivores, which makes no sense and is entirely at odds with the rest of the research in this area. The most likely outcome? Flukes happen, and this was probably a fluke. \nSo Should I Take Creatine Or Not?\nIf you’re a lifter who uses supplements, there is no safer bet than creatine. Its track record for strength and power performance is terrific, and new research confirms that it makes muscles bigger as well. For these outcomes, the classic 5 grams a day (or 0.07 g/kg) is plenty. When it comes to the optimal form of creatine, don’t overthink it. Creatine monohydrate is the gold standard, and alternative forms aren’t more effective because there really isn’t much room for improvement. Creatine monohydrate is safe, highly bioavailable, cost effective, and readily increases muscle creatine storage and improves performance – the quest to create new creatine formulations (for muscle-related outcomes) is a great example of looking for a solution without a problem.\n\nIf you’re looking to improve bone density or bone health, set your sights on higher priority items. You should focus on employing a solid resistance training program and adopting a well-balanced diet, with a particular focus on intakes of total energy, protein, calcium, and vitamin D.\nIf you’re trying to prevent neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, I totally understand why, but creatine is unlikely to provide any benefit. For these types of conditions, the best case scenario is that creatine provides mild attenuation of symptoms, when used in conjunction with higher-priority treatment approaches, at high doses (~20 grams per day).\nFinally, let’s say you’re dealing with some suboptimal cognitive conditions. Maybe you find that you’re chronically making important decisions when you’re sleep-deprived – emergency room clinicians don’t get to decide when medical emergencies occur, and firefighters on 48-hour shifts don’t get to choose when a fire starts. Or maybe you find that your cognitive function is slipping in frequently experienced scenarios of heightened stress or mental fatigue. Perhaps you’ve got a history of depression or anxiety and want to bolster your current approach to symptom management. \nFirst, let me be extremely clear: creatine is not the best available intervention for any of these scenarios. The best way to address sleep deprivation is by sleeping more, and the best way to manage depression symptoms is by working with a qualified clinician to pursue more impactful treatment options (like therapy and medication). But if you’re interested in leveraging creatine to give your brain a boost in any or all of the scenarios described above, emerging evidence suggests that creatine may be worth a try. Given the preliminary nature of this science, consider it an experiment, not a sure-fire strategy.\nIn these types of scenarios, creatine probably needs to be dosed at somewhere between 10 - 20 grams per day, or roughly 0.14 - 0.28 grams per kilogram of body mass. So far, evidence suggests that you may need to err toward the higher end of that range to confidently increase creatine levels in the brain. For best results, break your creatine up into ~5 gram doses and separate them throughout the day. If you take very large doses all at once, your likelihood of stomach discomfort increases considerably. It’s worth noting that some preliminary research suggests that guanidinoacetic acid supplementation may increase brain creatine levels more efficiently than creatine alone, but we need more research in this area before firm conclusions can be made.\nIn summary, new research confirms that creatine is the cream of the crop when it comes to lifting-oriented supplements. As for its brain-related effects, the potential is there but currently unproven. Only time (and more research) will tell whether it delivers on the early promises and truly lives up to that potential.\nFind more from Eric on…\nEric Trexler, PhD\nIG: @trexlerfitness",

    "title": "7 Protein Myths That Are Holding You Back",
    "url": "https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/7-protein-myths-that-are-holding-you-back",
    "content": "By: Gerald Ernat\nProtein isn’t just a buzzword tossed around by fitness influencers. It’s one of the most essential nutrients in your diet, playing a key role in muscle repair and growth, hormone production, immune function, and more.\nBut despite how common high-protein diets are, especially in fitness circles and all over social media, there’s still a surprising amount of misinformation floating around.\nLet’s cut through the noise and break down seven of the most common protein myths, using real science and practical takeaways you can actually apply.\n\n\n\n1. “You can only absorb 30 grams of protein per meal.”\nThis myth just won’t die.\nYou’ve probably heard that your body “can’t use” more than 30 grams of protein at a time, and anything extra goes to waste. But the truth is, your body absorbs and utilizes all the protein you eat. It just uses it in different ways.\nHere’s where the confusion comes from: muscle protein synthesis (MPS), the process your body uses to build and repair muscle tissue, may peak at around 25 to 35 grams in a single meal. But that doesn’t mean everything beyond that is wasted.\nLarger doses, like 60 or even 100 grams, can still be beneficial, especially before bed when your body goes several hours without food.\nTakeaway: If you prefer bigger meals or have fewer opportunities to eat during the day, don’t stress. Your body knows what to do with that protein.\n2. “Too much protein will hurt your kidneys.”\nThis one’s a classic. And like many nutrition myths, it started with a kernel of truth.\nPeople with advanced kidney disease may need to monitor protein intake. But in healthy individuals, there is no evidence that high-protein diets cause kidney damage.\nYour kidneys are highly adaptable. Studies consistently show that eating well above the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein doesn’t negatively impact kidney function in people without pre-existing conditions.\nSome research even suggests that higher protein intake may support better blood sugar regulation and body composition.\nTakeaway: Unless your doctor gives you a specific medical reason to limit protein, you’re safe to eat high-protein meals, even if they look a little intense.\n3. “You need a protein shake right after your workout or it doesn’t count.”\nLet’s be honest, the “anabolic window” is a little overhyped.\nYes, timing your protein intake around your workout can be helpful, but it’s not nearly as strict as the old “30-minute window or you wasted your lift” narrative suggests.\nMuscle protein synthesis stays elevated for hours after training. In fact, getting enough total protein across the entire day matters a whole lot more than slamming a shake the second you re-rack your last set.\nIf you had a protein-rich meal an hour before training, you’re already in a great place. If you train fasted, a post-workout shake is smart, but it’s not magic.\nTakeaway: Prioritize hitting your daily protein target. Pre- and post-workout nutrition can enhance recovery, but there’s no need to panic if you don’t chug your shake in the locker room.\n4. “Animal protein is always better than plant protein.”\nAnimal proteins tend to have higher bioavailability and all essential amino acids in ideal ratios. That’s true. But that doesn’t mean plant-based proteins are bad or can’t build muscle.\nYou just need a little more strategy.\nCombining complementary plant sources, like rice and beans or lentils and quinoa—ensures a full amino acid profile. And eating a sufficient total amount of protein is still the biggest factor, regardless of source.\nResearch shows that with careful planning, plant-based diets can support muscle gain and strength just as well as omnivorous diets, especially when total protein and leucine intake are matched.\nTakeaway: You don’t have to eat meat to get jacked. You just need to get enough protein from a variety of sources.\n5. “If you eat too much protein, it’ll turn into fat.”\nOut of all the macronutrients, protein is the least likely to be stored as fat.\nHere’s why:\nProtein has a high thermic effect of food (TEF). About 20 to 30 percent of the calories from protein are burned during digestion and metabolism. Compare that to carbs at 5 to 10 percent or fats at 0 to 3 percent.\nYour body also prefers to use excess protein for building and repairing tissue or oxidizing it for energy, not storing it.\nEven in overfeeding studies, people who ate tons of protein didn’t gain more fat. They gained more lean mass.\nTakeaway: If you're going to accidentally overeat something, let it be grilled chicken, not cheesecake.\n6. “Older adults don’t need as much protein.”\nActually, older adults need more, not less.\nAs we age, our muscles become less responsive to protein. This is called anabolic resistance. That means older adults need higher doses of protein per meal to trigger the same muscle-building response as younger folks.\nExperts recommend at least 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day for healthy aging. Meals with at least 30 grams of high-quality protein are ideal for stimulating muscle protein synthesis in older adults.\nTakeaway: Protein becomes more important as you age, not less. If you’re over 50, consider spreading your protein across three meals with at least 30 grams per meal.\n7. “You don’t need protein if you’re not trying to build muscle.”\nEven if you’ve never touched a barbell in your life, your body still needs protein.\nProtein supports:\n- Hormone production\n- Immune function\n- Enzyme activity\n- Tissue repair\n- Lean body mass maintenance\n\n- Skin, hair, and nail health\nAmino acids from protein are used throughout your body every single day, whether you're lifting weights or just living your life.\nTakeaway: Protein isn’t just for bodybuilders. It’s for anyone who wants to feel good, stay healthy, and age well.\nFinal Thoughts: How Much Protein Do You Really Need?\nIn healthy individuals, higher protein intake is both safe and beneficial.\nWhether your goals are performance, physique, or simply feeling better day-to-day, protein is a key player.\nSo how much should you aim for?\nWe recommend around 0.8 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day for most active individuals. If you’re dieting, training hard, or getting older, lean toward the higher end. If you’re just starting out or not training intensely, the lower end still supports basic needs.\nSplit your protein across 3 to 4 meals per day, make sure each meal has 25 to 40 grams depending on your size, and prioritize high-quality sources like:\n- Lean meats and poultry\n\n- Fish and seafood\n- Eggs and dairy\n- Whey or casein protein\n- Legumes, tofu, and tempeh for plant-based diets\nYou don’t need to obsess. But if you want to feel better, recover faster, and keep your muscle, especially as you age, protein deserves a spot at the top of your priority list.\n\nIf all the conflicting info out there has left you second-guessing your nutrition, I get it. I’ve been there too. That’s why I coach 1-on-1 to help people cut through the noise and get a plan that actually works for them.\nWhether you're trying to lose fat, build muscle, or just feel more in control of your diet, I’ll help you build a plan around your goals, preferences, and lifestyle. No rigid rules. No shame. Just clear, science-backed guidance and support.\nIf you're ready to take the guesswork out of your nutrition, I’d love to work with you.\n\nFind more from Gerald...\nInstagram: @Geraldernat",

He’s after something much more important: feeling good in his body.\nSo we had Jason stop by Dr. Mike’s gym to talk candidly about his goals post-retirement – to look big and strong, be big and strong, and not have his joints feel like a train wreck after every workout.\nThis approach isn’t just smart, it’s essential. The jump from elite-level football to everyday training is no joke, and Jason’s new game plan should be a blueprint for anyone dealing with a beat-up body but still hungry to lift hard.\nIn this article, we’ll break down Jason’s new approach to training and why it works. Whether you’re in a similar spot or just looking to train smarter, you’ll walk away with a clear game plan to get big, stay strong, and keep your joints happy in the process!\nWhy Training Like This Actually Works\nWhen your joints have been through the wringer, like 13 NFL seasons’ worth of wear and tear, you can’t train like a 22-year-old trying to max out every lift.\nAnd honestly, you don’t need to.\nUsing controlled reps, moderate weights, and deep stretch positions isn’t just a safer approach. It’s one of the most effective ways to build muscle and keep your joints feeling good. Slowing things down puts more tension on the muscle you’re trying to grow and less on the stuff you’re trying to keep healthy, like your shoulders, elbows, and knees.\nStretch-focused movements also drive growth in a way that’s joint-friendly and surprisingly powerful. Combine that with smart rep ranges and you’ve got a setup that builds muscle, improves stability, and doesn’t leave you wrecked the next day.\nAnd it’s not just about reducing joint stress. It can actually improve joint health over time. Training through a full range of motion helps build strength and resilience across the entire movement pattern. That gives your joints more muscular support, better flexibility, and lowers your risk of injury.\nThis isn't taking it easy. This is training smart. And for someone like Jason, or anyone who wants to keep making progress without constantly beating themselves up, it's the perfect foundation.\nThe Split: Upper Body for Size, Lower Body for Strength\nYou don’t always need to chase max size everywhere. For example, Jason already has legs that could anchor a suspension bridge. Now his goal is to bring up the upper body to match, get that thick, powerful look up top, and keep the leg strength that made him a menace on the field. And let’s be real, squatting heavy with the crew? That’s not just lifting. That’s religion.\nHere’s the beauty of it. You can train your upper body like a bodybuilder and your lower body like a powerlifter who’s just trying to not lose gains. That means hammering your chest, back, and arms with higher volume and frequency while dialing back lower body work to just what you need to maintain.\nEven something as simple as a few sets of 4 to 6 reps for quads and hamstrings, once or twice a week, is usually more than enough to maintain size and continue building strength. And since that lower body volume is much lower than what you’d need for growth, it frees up a lot more recovery bandwidth to crank up your upper body training and push for real size gains.\nThink about it: Strong legs. Big pump. No joint pain. Now, that’s the dream.\nHow to Set This Up for Yourself\nIf you're trying to train hard without wrecking your body, Jason Kelce's new approach is a pretty great model to follow. Whether you're fresh out of pro sports or just feeling all those years of heavy lifting and hard living, this style of training checks all the right boxes. It's smart, it works, and it doesn't leave you limping to the car.\nThe biggest shift? Slowing things down. In Jason's session with Dr. Mike, everything was done with control. That means lowering the weight slowly, pausing in the stretch, and then pushing the concentric portion of the lift with intent. It's not about chasing numbers. It's about making every rep actually hit the muscle you're trying to train, without grinding your joints into dust.\nMost of the exercises were chosen because they challenge you in the stretched position. Think deficit push-ups and deep incline presses. These movements don't just build muscle, they also help with joint health and flexibility. Basically, they make you look good and feel good, which is kind of the point.\nJason also learned a lesson a lot of us eventually face. Training six days a week sounds awesome until life hits you in the face. Between family, work, and everything else, three to four solid sessions a week is way more realistic and way more sustainable. You don't need to live in the gym. You just need to show up consistently and train with purpose.\nOne trick we had Jason use to make this workout brutally effective in a short amount of time was myo-reps. Not sure how to do myo-reps? It's simple. Hit a hard set close to failure, rest a few seconds, and then crank out mini-sets until you hit a rep goal. It saves time, keeps intensity high, and works great with bodyweight or machines. Perfect if you're in a hotel gym or just want to be in and out in 45 minutes.\nAlso, don't freak out if your reps drop a little from set to set. Jason noticed it and thought he was doing something wrong. He wasn't. That's just how fatigue works when you're actually training hard. If your first set is 12 and the next one is 9, that's fine. That's how it's supposed to go.\nAt the end of the day, this training style is efficient, joint-friendly, and great for building size and strength without feeling like you've been hit by a truck. Most workouts take around 45 minutes. No fluff. No wasted time. Just results.\nWant to see what this actually looks like in practice?\nWant to see what this actually looks like in practice? You can watch the full video to see the workout in action, complete with coaching cues, training tips, and a few laughs along the way. \nHere's a snapshot of Jason's workout from his session with Dr. Mike, complete with exercises, weights, and reps.\n   \n\n\n\nIf you want to train like this without overthinking every set and rep, the RP Hypertrophy app can help. It's packed with smart, joint-friendly workouts that grow muscle without the guesswork. Whether you're rebuilding after years of hard training or just want to make sure you're getting the most out of your time in the gym, the app gives you a plan built to actually work, no spreadsheets required.\nFind Trevor on…\nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

You’ve got your go-to meals, your gym is right down the road, and your schedule is predictable enough to block off training time.\nBut then—life happens. Maybe it’s a vacation, a work trip, or a long weekend away. Whatever it is, your routine goes out the window. No kitchen. No gym. Jet lag. Weird food options. Hotel pillows. Welcome to the beautiful chaos of being out of your comfort zone.\nTraveling doesn’t mean you have to abandon your goals. It just means you have to approach them a little differently.\nAt RP, we’ve worked with everyone from high-level athletes to busy parents and business travelers, and we’ve seen just about every travel curveball there is. With the right plan and a flexible mindset, you can stay on track and make progress even when your environment isn’t ideal.\nTraining While Traveling\n1. Train for Maintenance\nIf you’re traveling for vacation, your best move might be to shift your training mindset from “progress” to “maintenance.”\nMaintenance training is a way to hold onto your gains with a reduced workload. You don’t need to go all out every session. In fact, research shows that muscle and strength can be maintained with as little as one-third of your usual training volume, as long as the effort is still high. That means fewer sets or sessions, but still training hard.\nConsider timing a deload or active rest phase to match your trip. Not only does this give you a physical break, but it also lets you fully enjoy the trip without guilt. Plus, vacation recovery tends to be better than the day-to-day grind—extra sleep, fewer work stressors, and more downtime can help you come back feeling fresh and ready to crush it.\nIt’s not a step back. It’s a setup for a stronger comeback.\n2. Make Smart Adjustments\nIf you don’t want to deload or rest, you can still train hard with limited resources. Especially if you’re training for hypertrophy, the name of the game is training the target muscle close to failure.\nHotel gym with only dumbbells up to 50 pounds? No problem. Crank up the reps, reduce your rest periods, slow your tempo, and push your sets near failure.\nWill it feel like your regular gym workouts? No. But will it provide enough stimulus to keep things moving forward? Absolutely.\nThis is a great time to remember that consistency beats perfection. The workout might not be pretty, but it gets the job done.\n3. Find a Local Gym\nIn the age of smartphones and GPS, finding a nearby gym is easier than ever. Just do a quick search on Google Maps for \"gym near me\" or check apps like ClassPass or Gympass. Many commercial gyms offer day passes or short-term memberships that are perfect for travelers.\nThis can be an especially good option for longer trips, or if you’re preparing for an event and can’t afford to let intensity drop. Even if the gym isn’t ideal, you’ll likely be able to do most of your core lifts and stay on track.\nPro tip: If you’re serious about lifting while you travel frequently, consider booking hotels near known gyms or looking for accommodations with built-in fitness centers. A little planning goes a long way.\nDiet Strategies That Travel Well\n\n1. Eat for Maintenance\nJust like with training, maintenance is often your best friend when traveling.\nIf you’re on vacation, trying to stick to a strict fat loss or muscle gain diet can be stressful and frankly, unrealistic. The restaurants, the social events, the new experiences, all of it makes rigid dieting tough. And the reality is, vacations ruin diets and diets ruin vacations, as Dr. Melissa Davis says.\nThat’s why hitting pause and eating around maintenance can be a game-changer. You’re not trying to gain or lose, just hold steady. That gives you the flexibility to enjoy yourself without spiraling into \"I'll start over when I get back\" territory.\nEven better, maintenance can be a huge psychological relief. You can enjoy food, experience new places, and still feel in control.\n2. Plan Ahead When Travel Is Frequent\nVacations are one thing. But if you’re traveling every other week for work, maintenance won’t cut it long-term. In these situations, you need a solid travel game plan.\nThis means thinking ahead and packing portable, high-protein snacks like:\n- Protein bars\n- Jerky\n- Whey protein powder\nLook for hotels with kitchenettes or at least a microwave and fridge. That way, you can stop at a grocery store and grab:\n- Pre-cooked or canned lean proteins (chicken, tuna, tofu)\n- Microwaveable rice or potatoes\n- Frozen veggies or pre-washed salad kits\n- Fruit, yogurt, or low-fat cheese\nYou’re not aiming for gourmet meals. You’re aiming for enough control to keep the train moving. It might be simple, but it works.\n3. Plan to Be Active\nTraining might be tough, and your meals might not be perfect—but you can always move your body.\nOne of the most underrated strategies while traveling is just staying active. Keep your step count high, take the stairs, go for walks, explore the city, or even sneak in some morning mobility in your room.\nThis helps keep your NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis) up, which maintains a healthy calorie burn even if your workouts are lighter. It also helps with digestion, blood sugar regulation, and even mood—important stuff when your schedule is out of whack.\nPlus, being active helps you experience the place you’re in. Whether it’s walking the streets of a new city, hiking in a national park, or chasing your kids around a beach, movement connects you to the moment.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nYou don’t have to be perfect to make progress. Travel throws a wrench in your routine, sure—but it doesn’t have to throw off your results.\nWhether it’s a planned vacation, a last-minute work trip, or anything in between, you can still hit your goals. Maybe not with the same precision, but with enough intention and flexibility to keep things rolling.\nSo plan what you can. Control what you can. And when you can’t? Do your best and move on. Because long-term success isn’t built on perfect weeks. It’s built on consistent action over time, even when conditions aren’t perfect.\nFind Trevor on… \nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

    "content": "By: Trevor Fullbright\nFor years, the mental image most people had of someone “on a diet” was painfully specific:\nTupperware. Everywhere.\nFamily dinner? Tupperware.\nRestaurant? Tupperware.\nMovie theater? Yep, that mysterious fish smell is tuna and rice in Tupperware.\nThankfully, times have changed. The pendulum has swung back from “chicken breast in your pocket” levels of commitment, and we now know that you can get lean without being the weird guy microwaving cod in the breakroom. No judgment if that’s still you, we’ve all been there. Some of us still are there.\nHere’s the truth: you don’t need to lock yourself inside your kitchen for six months to lose fat.\nYou can enjoy meals out, maintain a social life, and still make serious progress if you have a plan.\nThis guide walks you through some classic strategies and then dives into a few science-backed, under-the-radar tricks you can use to eat out, enjoy it, and stay on track. Sound good? Let’s go.\nStart with the basics\n1. Look up the menu ahead of time\nThis might seem obvious, but it’s still one of the best tools in the game. Most restaurants post their full nutrition info online. That means you can pick your meal before you’re hungry and overwhelmed by menu chaos.\nDon’t leave it to chance when you’re starving and your friend is raving about the triple-stack burger. Pick your meal beforehand, pre-log it if you’re tracking macros, and roll in feeling like a fat loss master\n2. Eat lighter earlier in the day\n\nThis doesn’t mean fasting all day until you arrive at dinner and black out into a 2,000-calorie feeding frenzy. That’s how you end up in the fetal position, covered in queso.\nInstead, bank calories smartly. Eat lower-calorie, high-protein, high-fiber meals earlier in the day. Think Greek yogurt with berries, egg whites with veggies, or a protein shake with a piece of fruit. This keeps you full and leaves more wiggle room for the fun meal later.\n3. Don’t be afraid to ask for adjustments\n\nLet’s be honest. Restaurant chefs don’t care about your abs. They care about flavor. And that means sneaky calories like butter-basted steaks, sugar-glazed veggies, and oil-drenched grilled chicken.\n\nThis isn’t weird or high-maintenance anymore. You’re not being that guy, you’re being the smart guy. And it can save you hundreds of calories without sacrificing the meal experience.\n4. Make it your last meal of the day\n\nIf you know dinner out is going to be your biggest meal, make it the day’s finale. That way, you don’t have to keep trying to get back on track after a large, off-plan lunch that left you sleepy, bloated, and craving cookies.\nWhen dinner is the anchor of your day, it's easier to eat well beforehand, enjoy yourself at the meal, and then wind things down for the night.\nNext-level tactics \n\n5. Be the first one to order\nThis sounds minor, but it’s surprisingly powerful. In psychology, there’s something called order anchoring. When people around you order indulgent meals, it subconsciously nudges you to do the same.\nSolution: be the first one to order.\nLock in your meal before “double bacon cheeseburger with onion rings and a milkshake” has a chance to hijack your goals.\n6. Ask for a to-go box with your meal\n\nThis is a huge calorie-control hack. When your meal arrives, immediately box up half. Out of sight means out of mouth. You’ll feel satisfied with less, and you’ve got leftovers for tomorrow. Plus in this economy, that’s just smart budgeting.\nAnd yes, your date might look at you sideways the first time. But they’ll get over it when you’re looking lean and eating steak again the next night.\n7. Throw back a shake before you leave the house\n\nThis one’s a secret weapon. Having a whey protein shake (20 to 30 grams) about 30 to 60 minutes before your meal doesn’t just help you hit your protein target. It helps reduce how much you eat at the meal itself.\nWhy? Studies show that whey increases satiety hormones like GLP-1 and PYY and can lower free-choice food intake by 100 to 250 calories on average. That’s a big deal.\nTranslation: it helps you feel full faster, so you don’t demolish an appetizer, entrée, and dessert and then pick off your friend’s plate too.\nWrap-up: Yes, you can eat out and lose fat\n\nHere’s the deal. Getting lean doesn’t mean going full hermit mode.\nYou don’t need to cancel your social life, bring your scale to dinner, or pretend you’re not hungry every time you walk by a restaurant.\nYou just need a game plan.\n\nUse the simple tactics above, plan ahead, and you’ll be amazed at how consistent you can be without sacrificing joy, friendship, or flavor.\nSure, if you’re four weeks out from a bodybuilding show and surviving on caffeine and spite, eating out might not be worth the tradeoff. But for the vast majority of us? You can absolutely hit your goals and still enjoy a good burger with friends without the side of shame.\n\n\nFind Trevor on… \nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

    "content": "By: Trevor Fullbright\n\"Everybody wanna be a bodybuilder, but ain’t nobody wanna lift no heavy ass weight!\" – Ronnie Coleman\nThat’s one of my all-time favorite Ronnie quotes… but I actually think it misses the mark.\nMost people I talk to who are into bodybuilding love training. Getting to the gym, pushing hard, chasing PRs—that part isn’t the issue. The real roadblock for most folks? Diet.\nAnd it’s not hard to see why. You hop online and everyone’s using gourmet meal prep services, buying organic everything, and swearing by grass-fed this or wild-caught that. That stuff gets expensive, and it can make you feel like if you’re not doing everything “perfectly,” you might as well not bother.\nBut here’s the truth. Eating to build muscle doesn’t have to be expensive. In fact, it can be downright cheap if you play your cards right.\nLet’s start by talking about what doesn’t need to drain your wallet.\nDo You Need to Buy Organic?\nWhen you see “organic” on a food label, it refers to how the food was grown or raised. Organic produce is grown without most synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat, dairy, and eggs come from animals that aren’t given antibiotics or growth hormones and are fed organic feed.\nSounds good in theory. But from a muscle-building perspective, it doesn’t offer many advantages.\nNutrient content between organic and non-organic foods is nearly identical. Any differences in vitamins or antioxidants are usually small and inconsistent. Organic foods may have lower pesticide residue, but conventional foods still fall within safe ranges according to health agencies.\nBottom line: Organic food might offer peace of mind, but it is not required for building muscle. Total protein and calories matter far more.\n\n\n\nGrass-Fed vs Conventional Meat\nGrass-fed meat comes from animals that primarily eat grass, while conventional livestock are usually grain-fed during the later stages of life. Grass-finished means the animal ate only grass for its entire life.\nNutritionally, grass-fed meat is often slightly leaner and may contain more omega-3s, conjugated linoleic acid, and antioxidants. However, these differences are very small and unlikely to make a meaningful difference for muscle growth or overall health.\nBoth grass-fed and grain-fed meats are excellent sources of high-quality protein, B vitamins, iron, and creatine. Grass-fed meat may appeal for ethical or environmental reasons, but when it comes to supporting your training and physique goals, either one gets the job done.\nWhat Actually Matters\nMuscle growth relies on three main factors: training hard, eating enough protein, and eating enough total calories.\nYou’ve probably already got the training part handled. So let’s look at how to fuel your gains without burning through your budget.\nProtein on a Budget\nYou don’t need steak every day to get jacked. The classic boneless, skinless chicken breast is cheap, lean, and effective. But eating nothing but chicken gets old fast.\nBudget friendly protein \n- Pork tenderloin is often cheaper than chicken and just as lean\n- Beef eye of round is lean, high in protein, and one of the cheapest cuts of red meat\n- Boneless, skinless chicken thighs or beef chuck roast add variety and more fat, which can help if you're in a calorie surplus\n\nYou can also get great value from canned tuna, eggs, frozen fish, and even Greek yogurt or cottage cheese.\nCarbs That Stretch Your Dollar\nCarbs are one of the easiest and cheapest nutrients to load up on. You can buy bulk rice and beans for next to nothing. Pasta, potatoes, oats, and bread are all inexpensive and great for fueling hard training.\nIf you are serious about making progress, don’t fear carbs. Embrace them. Your wallet and your performance will thank you.\nAffordable Fruits and Veggies: Fresh, Frozen, or Canned?\nPeople often assume you have to buy fresh produce to eat healthy, but that just isn’t true. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables can be just as nutritious—sometimes even more so—and they last much longer.\nFrozen produce is typically picked at peak ripeness and flash-frozen quickly, which helps preserve most of its vitamins and minerals. Canned options retain many nutrients as well, though some heat-sensitive ones like vitamin C may be slightly reduced. Still, both are excellent sources of fiber, antioxidants, and other important micronutrients.\nThe best choice is the one you’ll actually eat consistently. Just check the label to avoid added sugars or excess sodium in canned goods. And if you’ve ever tossed a five dollar tub of spinach that turned to sludge in your fridge, frozen or canned starts to look like the smarter choice. Less waste, more gains.\n\nBuild Muscle, Save Money: Here’s a Sample Day\nTo tie it all together, here’s what a full day of eating could look like for someone aiming to build muscle on a budget. This sample plan hits around 2,500 calories and 180 grams of protein using affordable, easy-to-find foods.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nRonnie may never shout, “Ain’t nobody wanna eat,” but maybe he should.\nTraining hard is the fun part for most of us. Getting your diet in check, especially on a budget, takes a little more planning. But it’s absolutely possible to eat for muscle growth without draining your bank account.\nStick to the basics. Be consistent. Spend wisely. And maybe use the money you save on food to buy new shirts once your sleeves start getting tight.\n\nFind Trevor on… \nInstagram: @Trevorxgage",

    "content": "By: Nick Harden\nAsk most people in the gym if they train hard, and you’ll almost always hear “yes.” But if that were truly the case, we’d see way more people making consistent progress.\nThe reality? Most lifters don’t push themselves nearly as hard as they think.\nTraining hard isn’t just about sweating or feeling tired. It’s about using the right principles to stimulate growth and push your limits. Let’s break down what actually training hard looks like—and how to make sure you’re progressing over time.\n\nThe Deload Test: Are You Actually Pushing It?\nOne of the simplest ways to check your intensity is to ask:\n“When was the last time I deloaded?”\nIf the answer is “never” or “I don’t feel like I need to,” you’re probably not training hard enough. Over time, intense training should accumulate enough fatigue that you need a structured deload to recover and reset for your next training cycle.\n\nTechnique First: The Foundation of Real Effort\nPushing yourself doesn’t just mean going heavier—it means training smarter, with proper form that maximizes muscle growth and minimizes injury risk.\nHere’s what that should look like:\n- Controlled eccentrics – Lower the weight slowly to keep tension on the muscle.\n- Explosive concentrics – Push with intent. Drive every rep like you’re trying to launch through the ceiling.\n- Full range of motion (ROM) – Half-repping? You’re shortchanging growth and risking imbalances or injury. Full ROM stimulates full development.\nSkip these basics, and you risk poor muscle development and injury—especially in common weak links like knees and elbows.\nSoreness, Pump & Reaching Failure\nYou don’t need to feel sore or pumped after every workout—but if you never do, something’s probably off.\nIf you’re not getting that deep muscle burn or post-session soreness, ask yourself:\n- Are you actually engaging the target muscle?\n- Or are you just moving weight from point A to point B and hoping for the best?\nOne key factor here is proximity to failure—often tracked using Reps in Reserve (RIR) or Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). When you consistently stop too far from failure, you’re likely missing out on growth stimulus.\nThis isn’t a huge deal when you're new to lifting (and gaining muscle just by showing up), but once those beginner gains wear off? The details start to matter.\n\nMost People Don’t Know What “Failure” Feels Like\nHere’s the truth: if you’ve never actually trained to failure, you might have no clue where that line is.\nSometimes, the best way to learn is with a spotter. Push until they have to help you finish the set.\nCase in point: my wife.\n She thought she was stopping with one rep in the tank on incline bench. On her first set, she stopped at 7 reps. On the next, I told her not to stop until I physically had to take the bar from her.\nShe hit 19 reps.\nTwelve more than she thought she had. That moment completely changed how she approached training—and her performance has been climbing ever since.\nIf you suspect you're in the same boat, try a true failure set with a spotter. You might be pleasantly shocked by how much more you’ve got.\nProgressive Overload Isn’t Just Adding Weight\nTo keep building strength and size, you’ve got to challenge your muscles with more over time—not just in load, but in volume and intensity.\nThat’s where two key concepts come in:\nEach week, you slowly increase sets, reps, or load—working your way from MEV to MRV. Once you reach that ceiling, you deload to reset fatigue and grow even more during the next cycle.\nWhy This Matters: Avoid the “1:1 Trap”\nHere’s the problem if you go all-out every session:\nYou overreach → then crash → then need a week to recover.\nThat’s a 1:1 ratio of hard work to rest. Over the course of a year, that’s 6 months training, 6 months recovering.\nBut if you train hard for 5 weeks, then deload on the 6th?\nYou’re getting nearly 10 full months of productive training per year.\nThat’s a massive difference in long-term results—and you get to spend more time doing what you actually enjoy: training.\n\nDon’t Let Your Nutrition Be the Bottleneck\nEven with perfect training intensity, poor nutrition can hold you back.\n- Too little carbs? Your nervous system and muscles won’t perform at their best.\n- Not enough protein? You’re short on the building blocks for growth and recovery.\nIf your training feels stuck, your diet might be the culprit. Fuel matters just as much as form.\nTo learn more about carbs and performance, check out this article!\n\nWhat If You’re Training Too Hard?\nMost people undertrain—but a few push too hard for too long. That can lead to chronic fatigue, poor recovery, and stalled gains.\nIf you feel beat up week after week, it might be time for:\n- An active rest phase (2–4 weeks)\n- A training pivot—swap barbell work for dumbbells, or shift from hypertrophy to a strength block\n- A resensitization phase to refresh the stimulus and avoid burnout\n\nIt’s not about doing less. It’s about training smarter so you can keep improving.\n \n\nBy applying these principles, you’ll train harder and smarter—and start seeing results that match your effort.\n\nLet’s Make Your Time in the Gym Count\nIf this article hit home and you’re realizing your training or nutrition might not be as dialed in as you thought—let’s fix that. With 1:1 coaching, I’ll help you structure a personalized program that uses progressive overload the right way, sharpens your technique, aligns your effort with your goals, and keeps you recovering and growing week after week.

    "url": "https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/born-to-be-a-hotrod",
    "content": "By: Dr. Derek Wilcox\nIf you believe in fate, my origin story might convince you I was destined for a life built around performance. I was born in 1987, on the day of the Daytona 500. Bill Elliott won that race, which my mom has never forgotten—not because she’s a NASCAR fan, but because my dad insisted on watching it while she was in early labor.\nLegend has it, when I came home from the hospital, there was a football in my crib and a tiny set of golf clubs waiting beside it, like my path was already marked by sports and speed. And if you rewind about nine months before that day in Bristol, Tennessee, the IHRA Spring Nationals were underway. Tim Grose beat Kenny Bernstein in Funny Car, and according to family lore, that’s also when I won my own race into existence.\nSo maybe it’s no surprise that I’ve always felt a deep, almost spiritual connection between motorsports and human performance.\n\n\nRacecars and Human Bodies: Built to Perform\nThe parallels between racecars and our bodies run deep. On a macro level:\n- Chassis = Skeleton\n- Engine = Muscles\n- Ignition = Nervous System\n\n- Suspension = Connective Tissues\n\n- Fuel System = Digestive System\nJust like a racecar, the human body is built to generate and transfer force in skilled, specific, and explosive ways across a field or around a track to beat the clock or the competition.\nZoom in to the micro level, and the similarities keep coming. Inside our \"engine,\" actin and myosin filaments slide like pistons, generating power strokes in a sarcomere that functions like a crankshaft turning a drive shaft of muscular force. Our nervous system sends electrical signals to fire movement patterns, just like spark plug wires from a distributor sending current to a combustion chamber.\nMotor neurons act like spark plugs, delivering precise electrical impulses to produce finely tuned, complex motion. It’s all timed, patterned, and deliberate.\nWhat Fuels the Human Engine?\n\nIn this metaphor, protein becomes the aluminum components of an engine block, forming the durable hardware for explosive reactions. Water and fats work like motor oil, lubricating joints and helping the system run smoothly.\nThen there’s fuel—carbohydrates. Their variety and performance impact rival the fuel options in racing:\n\n\nYou wouldn’t pour nitro into a stock engine without risking damage. The same principle applies to your body. Too much high-powered fuel too often, and something is bound to break.\n\n\nThe Real Difference: We Don’t Buy New Parts, We Build Them\nRace teams swap out engines and transmissions as needed. We don’t have that option. But we can build higher-performance parts by training smarter and recovering better.\n\nJust like a racecar needs a tune-up tailored to its event, we need training that matches our sport or goals. Developing the body holistically helps prevent breakdowns and keeps the system performing at a high level.\n\n\nFrom Powerlifting to Pit Lane\nThat mindset shaped my own competitive career. As a powerlifter, I wasn’t just the driver. I was the crew chief too. I had to know everything about how my body worked, recovered, and performed. I had to understand how to run my hot rod and get the most out of it.\nThat drive led me to earn a PhD in Sport Physiology and Performance. Along the way, I broke several all-time powerlifting records. And that same approach eventually brought me into the world of professional motorsports.\n\n\nCrossing Paths with Clay Millican\nIn 2017, I teamed up with Dr. Kaela Hierholzer to support Clay Millican, one of the icons of Top Fuel drag racing. Clay has been racing the world’s fastest machines for about as long as I’ve been lifting.\nWhile I was chasing records on the powerlifting platform, he was doing the same on the drag strip. He’s run a best elapsed time of 3.628 seconds over 1000 feet, hit a top speed of 338 miles per hour, and earned six IHRA World Championships.\nWorking with Clay brought everything full circle. It combined everything I’d ever studied and experienced about performance, pressure, and precision.\n\n\nFinal Lesson: It’s the People, Not Just the Performance\nStats are cool. Wins are great. But what really sticks with you are the people you train, compete, and grow with. The coaches, teammates, and mentors make the journey worthwhile.\nWhatever kind of racecar you decide to be, build it with pride. And when it’s time to compete?\nAs Clay says,\n “Stomp on that loud pedal,”\n and get after it.\nIf you’re looking to take your performance to the next level—whether that’s in the gym, on the track, or anywhere in between—personalized coaching can make a world of difference. I work with clients 1:1 to build stronger engines, balance the system, and fine-tune their approach for real results.\n\nFind Dr. Wilcox on..\nInstagram: @wilcoxstrengthinc",
