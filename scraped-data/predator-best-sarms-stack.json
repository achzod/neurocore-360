These non-steroidal SARMs can have a place in a muscle building or fat loss programme, and results can be even more impressive when stacked correctly.\n\nHere we will outline some of the best stacks for common goals including the best SARMs for bodybuilding as well as suggested PCT supplements.\n\nWhy stack SARMs?\nWhat are the best SARMs to take?\nBest SARMs stack for beginners\nBest SARMs stack for cutting/fat loss\nBest SARMs for bulking up in size\nBest SARMs stack for strength\nPCT following a SARMs Cycle\nConclusion \nFAQs\n\n \n\nWhy stack SARMs?\n\nThere are a few reasons why you might want to stack SARMs. If you are a complete newbie, we would probably advise starting with just one SARM to assess your individual response and to identify which properties of that product you do (or don’t) like.\n\nFrom here, stacking SARMs is the logical way to progress your usage if you hit a plateau or are looking for something harder hitting. This also means that you can reap the rewards of two separate SARMs. For example, the highlight of one might be lean, dry gains, whereas the highlight of another might be enhanced recovery.\n\nStacking also means that you can use a lower dose of each, which may result in less risk of side effects than a high dose of one compound. This is especially true if you implement something non-hormonal like cardarine or mk-677 (which aren’t actually SARMs, but more on this later).\n\nWhat are the best SARMs to take?\n1. OTR-AC (The strongest SARM)\n\nOTR-AC Elite is the newest SARM to hit the block and one which promises to revolutionise what SARMS can deliver. While SARMS have traditionally been considered the milder alternative to prohormones, OTR-AC uses technology which combines the best of both of these muscle building categories. It does this by taking as a base compound, the well known SARM Ostarine but then pairs it to an ester which as experienced users of testosterone will know, takes something which is weakly bioavailable (testosterone) and massively increases bioavailability and with it, testosterone's muscle building effects. \n\nThe new SARM OTR-AC Elite, is the first, and to date, the only SARM which has adopted esterification as a technique to drive greater anabolic benefits for the user than would be possible otherwise. You can find out more about OTR-AC in our article on OTR-AC benefits.\n\n2. Ostarine (best SARM overall for beginners)\n\nOstarine has the most human research of any SARM. It is incredibly versitile, whether cutting or bulking, and side effects are very mild at low-moderate doses when used sensibly. If you've never used any SARMs before, this would be our first choice. \n\n3. Andarine (best choice for women)\n\nAndarine is a relatively mild SARM that is one of the better choices for women. Also known as S4, it can support gains in lean mass and recomp. \n\n4. LGD-4033 (great for bulking)\n\nLigandrol is considered to be 11x stronger than ostarine, helping you gain muscle and size in a short amount of time. The perfect step up for anyone on a massing phase. \n\n5. Radarine \n\nRadarine, or Testolone, is one of the most popular SARMs. It is loved for its benefits to performance, recovery and allowing you to gain muscle at an enhanced rate. Radarine can be used as a standalone for your first cycle or stacked. \n\n6. YK-11 (the strongest SARM)\n\nIf you've been using SARMs for some time, and have experimented with the above options and stacking, YK-11 bridges the gap between SARMs and Prohormones. An incredibly strong SARM, always use with comprehensive cycle support and keep duration of use as short as possible. \n\n7. Ibutamoren \n\nNot a SARM but a GH-Secretagogue, Iburamoren (MK-677) has a powerful appetite increasing effect and can help sleep and recovery through increasing growth hormone. Perfect for stacking while on a bulk. \n\n8. Cardarine\n\nCardarine is the second compound on this list that is not actually a SARM. Cardarine works via the PPAR pathway to increase endurance, promote a healthy lipid profile and support fat loss. \n\n9. Lean Mass GH Stack (best value SARM stack)\n\nLean Mass GH Stack is a combination of MK-677 and LGD, perfect for those looking to gain size on a budget. Boost appetite, feel stronger in the gym and recover better between sessions with this stack.\n\n10. Stenabolic\n\nStenabolic or SR9009 is another compound which is technically not a SARM at all but is actually what is called a Rev-ErbA ligand. Being non-hormonal, it is a good choice for users wanting to avoid suppression of natural testosterone as well as being highly prized for its ability to increase exercise performance, and reduce body fat. \n\n11. ACP-105\n\nACP-105 is one of the new kids on the block of the SARM world, designed to provide anabolic effects with a bare minimum of suppression of natural testosterone and negligible side effects. This makes ACP-105 a good choice for beginners to hardcore supplements who are likely the ones who tend to be most cautious due to concerns over potential side effects. While ACP-105 will not deliver the same degree of muscle gains as say Radareal, it would still provide an advantage over and above what any amount of natural muscle builder could give while aiding both muscle recovery, enabling you to handle more volume and even boost the rate at which you cut bodyfat.\n\nWhat is the best SARMs stack? Here’s our top 4 list\n\nThere is no one best SARMs stack, however there are SARMs that compliment one another better than others, and might be more applicable to your goal. While all SARMs work by targeting the androgen receptors, some have slightly different results that might be better suited for fat loss, muscle gain, recovery, endurance or appetite.\n\n1) Best SARMs stack for beginners starting bodybuilding\n\nAndarine S-4 & Cardarine. This stack is ideal for those who are just looking to progress to using SARMs because it combines the ‘mildest’ SARM, Andarine, with Cardarine which is a non-hormonal supplement that is commonly used in a dieting phase but can actually be of benefit year-round.\n\nAndarine\n\nAndarine, also known as S4, is a great choice for a first SARM. Andarine can prevent muscle loss on a diet, encourage lean muscle growth, and aid strength and endurance. Andarine, along with Ostarine, is the safest choice for females (at a VERY low dose) who have decided to take the SARM route and want to minimise the risk of developing side effects.\n\nCardarine\n\nThe key thing to understand about cardarine is that it is NOT a SARM. Rather than working on androgen receptors, Cardarine works on the PPAR pathway as a PPAR Receptor Agonist. Cardarine is an excellent choice for those who are looking to increase fitness level, endurance and recovery. So, if you are dieting, Cardarine can support you in getting your high intensity cardio done to the best of your ability, or if gaining, it might help you power through those higher rep sets.\n\nOutside of the gym, cardarine might have further benefits to health markers such as blood glucose, lipid profile, blood pressure and inflammation. The use of certain anabolic substances can skew these, so Cardarine actually might help mitigate some of the damage done.\n\nStenabolic could be considered as an alternative to Cardarine when the goal is to cut fat.\n\n2) Best SARMs stack for cutting/fat loss\n\nOstarine & Cardarine. We believe the ostarine and cardarine stack to be the best stack for fat cutting and lean muscle mass. This complete cutting stack means that you can not only hold onto your hard earned muscle while dropping fat, but build new muscle tissue. It will also support your cardio performance and allow you to burn more fat as fuel during training.\n\nOstarine\n\nOstarine mk-2866 is a great choice for a beginner to intermediate user and is currently the most researched SARM we have. While, at the time of writing this, SARMs have not been cleared for use by the FDA, Ostarine shows the most promise with doses of 3mg showing selective action (although, of course, the bodybuilding community will tend to opt for higher). Benefits of ostarine include body recomposition in the form of increase muscle mass and reduced body fat. It has been compared to the anabolic steroid anavar. With a half life of around 24 hours, Ostarine is perfect to dose just once per day.\n\nCardarine\n\nPPAR delta agonists such as Cardarine gw-501516 can increase fatty acid oxidation over glycolysis, meaning that fats, not stored carbohydrates, are used as fuel for exercise. This has downstream benefits on muscular endurance and body composition, hence Cardarine often being considered a fat burner. If weight loss is the goal, Cardarine can stack well with stimulant based fat burners to increase energy expenditure further and increase your calorie deficit.\n\n3) Best SARMs for bulking up in size\n\nYK-11, OTR-AC, Radarine & MK-677. This is a pretty heavy triple stack best saved for those who have already ran cycles of one or two of the products included with positive results previously. This is the ultimate stack to help you build muscle when combined with adequate calorie and protein intake and intense weight training. We'd suggest running this for 8 weeks then following with a thorough PCT.\n\nYK-11\n\nYK-11 is best reserved for more advanced bodybuilders looking to put on serious size. When it comes to building muscle, only prohormones will outshine YK-11, which many consider the most potent SARM. When using YK-11, you can expect similar effects to other SARMs but it actually has the structure of a steroid. It is similar to DHT which is a naturally occurring hormone in the body crucial for male development. Other highlights of YK-11 include myostatin inhibition and increase bone density.\n\nRadarine (RAD-140)\n\nRadarine, also known as Testolone, has been compared to using exogenous testosterone. It increases protein synthesis, strength and endurance and stacks well with other SARMs. In a stack like this, we'd suggest starting with 10mg Radarine daily.\n\nOTR-AC\n\nWe have touched upon OTR-AC already. In a nutshell it takes all the benefits or ostarine and turbocharges them and does so incredibly well.\n\nMK-677\n\nMK-677, or Ibutamoren, is a second compound that is often mistaken for a SARM when it is actually a GH secretagogue. While selective androgen receptor modulators work on those receptors, ibutamoren works to increase growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) through stimulating ghrelin to optimise hormone levels for better growth and recovery. Effects of this include better quality sleep and heightened appetite, ideal for times when pushing food and driving training performance hard! MK-677 can cause a little water retention so is best reserved for bulking.\n\n4) Best SARMs stack for strength\n\nLigandrol, Radarine & OTR-AC. We'd suggest running this cycle for an 8-week cycle to maximise strength in conjunction with a progressive overload model of resistance training. As well as building strength, you can expect a muscle building effect from your ability to load the muscles with heavier weight and recover better between training sessions.\n\nLigandrol (LGD-4033)\n\nLigandrol LGD 4033 is undoubtedly one of the most popular SARMs, and for good reason. Ligandrol brings rapid strength improvements and prevents bone degeneration, so you are at less risk of injury as you get progressively stronger in the gym.\n\nRadarine\n\nRadarine/Testolone alone is more anabolic than testosterone with an anabolic to androgenic ratio of 90:1, this means that it improves sex drive and muscle growth rapidly. Results will be particularly notable in men in their 30s and older who had perhaps been experiencing some decline in their own testosterone levels prior to use.\n\nOTR-AC\n\nFor those looking for the ultimate in strength and lean mass gains, OTR-AC Elite is in a class of its own thanks to the use of an ester to greatly boost absorption which both confers greater gains in muscle mass and strength but also delivers the gains more quickly. In this respect it is similar to how the prohormone Nanodrol will deliver faster and bigger gains in muscle mass than oral methylstenbolone (or anything prohormone or SARM for that matter) by virtue of its smaller molecule size enabling more of the compound to reach your muscles.\n\nPCT following a SARMs Cycle\n\nPost cycle therapy (PCT) after using SARMs will vary depending on SARMs used, dose and duration of cycle. Speaking generally however, you can usually run a successful PCT using over the counter supplements due to the selective nature of SARMs meaning that side effects are less likely and can be less severe when they do materialise.\n\nFirstly, you want to have a potent testosterone booster such as Activate Xtreme by Driven Sports at hand to support your body in kickstarting its endogenous testosterone production and restoring healthy natural testosterone levels. Testosterone suppression can be a risk with any hormonal supplement, so without blood work to confirm hormone status post-cycle, the best thing you can do is pay close attention to your body and help it where you can.\n\nNext, if using higher doses or more potent SARMs, you might want to have some oestrogen control ready such as Alchemy by Hydrapharm. Alchemy inhibits the aromatase enzyme so that testosterone cannot be converted into oestrogen. Its action will also support a reduction in cortisol and raise testosterone in a different way to a testosterone booster.\n\nFinally, you might want to cycle SARMs with natural muscle builders to put yourself in the best possible position to maintain gains made on cycle and continue to progress. Our favourites for lean mass include Adamantine by Hydrapharm and even single ingredient supplements such as creatine and phosphatidic acid.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the right SARMs stack for you, the main thing to take into account is what experience you already have with SARMs and what you are hoping to get from your cycle.\n\nOur general advice would be:\n\nUse the lowest dose and cycle duration recommended by the brand to start\nNon-SARMs such as Cardarine or MK-677 can easily be added to support your stack\nAlways have PCT at the ready for when the cycle has been completed\nStay on top of health supplements while you are on cycle, and after\nBe patient and make sure your diet and training are aligned with your goal!\n\n \n\nSARM Stack FAQs\n\nWhich is the best SARM for building muscle?\nThe universally 'best' SARM for building muscle is OTR-AC. This is far more powerful than Ostarine and exhibits powerful lean muscle building effects.\n\nWhich SARMs can you stack?\nThere are multiple ways that you can stack SARMs! If in doubt, stick to milder SARMs such as Ostarine or Andarine for the base of your stack and add a non-hormonal supplement like MK-677 or Cardarine before you add another SARM to keep side effects at bay.\n\nWhich SARM is the strongest?\nOf the SARMs found here at Predator Nutrition, we would regard OTR-AC Elite to be the strongest SARM on offer followed by YK-11. YK-11 is an extremely potent SARM that actually carries a steroid nomenclature. However, by utilising the ester technology seen with steroids like testosterone, OTR-AC edges it for potency.\n\nWhich is the best RAD 140 stack?\nRadarine could easily be stacked with another SARM such as ligandrol. You could also add a supplement that targets the PPAR pathway such as Cardarine or works to increase growth hormone secretion such as Ibutamoren.\n\nWhat is the best LGD 4033 stack?\nWe would advise stacking LGD with Testolone or Ibutamoren for an effective muscle building and strength enhancing stack.\n\nCan RAD 140 and Cardarine stack?\nThese two products can certainly be stacked! Cardarine is non-hormonal and does not act on the androgen receptors so can be regarded as separate from a SARM such as RAD 140. These two products would work synergistically to improve fitness levels and endurance.\n\nCan you stack SARMs with steroids?\nSARMs could be stacked with steroids in theory but be aware there is not any research to go off on this, so we would only suggest this to advanced users of hardcore supplements. If using such a stack, always use on-cycle support and start with a low dose of each compound.\n\nCan you stack SARMs with prohormones?\nSARMs can be stacked with prohormones, with caution. We'd advise a natural progression to your cycle designs. Use one supplement at a time and, after a few cycles, you may add the lowest effective dose of another SARM/prohormone to advance the stack. Cardarine or Ibutamoren, on the other hand, can be added to any stack as they do not fall under either of these categories.\n\nCan you stack SARMs with testosterone boosters?\nIt would make more sense to use a testosterone booster post-cycle however it certainly wouldn't do any harm. While on a cycle of a supplement that increases testosterone artificially, natural production can be shut down regardless of using a booster. Testosterone boosters can help kick-start endogenous production after the cycle.\n\nWhat is the best sarms company?\nIt always pays to research a SARMs brand before giving them your hard earned money due to the amount of counterfeits on the market. We'd suggest brands such as Augmented Labs or Olympus Labs, available here at Predator Nutrition.\n\n \n\nShop SARMs Here\n\nSAVANNAH WESTERBY\nSavannah is part of the team here at Predator.
