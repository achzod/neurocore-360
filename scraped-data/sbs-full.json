    "content": "Not Another Boring Creatine Guide: Answers to FAQs and Lesser-Known Benefits\nby Eric Trexler\nArticles, Nutrition, Supplements\nYou know creatine is beneficial for strength and power output. But you probably aren't familiar with the lesser-known benefits and effects covered in this article.\n\nWithout question, creatine is the gold standard by which all strength-related supplements are judged. The basic premise for how and why creatine works so well is pretty straightforward:\n\nWe store creatine in our muscles. A phosphate group can be easily attached to creatine, thereby forming phosphocreatine, which is also stored in our muscles. When muscles do work, they use adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The process of “using” ATP involves removing a phosphate group, which turns adenosine triphosphate (three phosphates) into adenosine diphosphate (two phosphates). Phosphocreatine swoops in to rapidly donate its phosphate group, ADP becomes ATP, and we’re ready to do more work in a very short amount of time.\n\nHigh-intensity exercise is characterized not only by the use of a large amount of total ATP, but more critically by its need for rapid access to ATP. Compared to rest, the rate of ATP demand increases up to 1,000-fold during intense exercise. If ATP isn’t available within a reasonably fast time frame, performance simply cannot be sustained, and intensity drops as a consequence. Phosphocreatine provides rapid ATP replenishment, but a muscle can only store so much creatine and phosphocreatine at a given time. In this sense, creatine can be thought of as a quantitatively limited, but fairly instantaneous, reservoir for the replenishment of ATP. The purpose of creatine supplementation is to increase the amount of stored creatine, thereby bolstering the capacity of this rapid ATP-generating energy system. In addition, creatine has been shown to increase lean body mass, presumably due to increased intramuscular fluid retention and improved resistance training capacity.\n\nI could spend the next 7,000 words recapping hundreds of studies showing that creatine increases strength and power output during short-duration, high-intensity exercise in healthy young adults. Fortunately, I won’t, because that stopped being interesting about 15 years ago. Instead, this article will explore some of the lesser-known aspects of creatine and address some of the most frequently asked questions.\n\nTable Of Contents\nOther Performance-Enhancing Mechanisms of Creatine\nWhich Type of Creatine is Best?\nMaximizing Muscle Creatine Saturation: Loading, Cycling, and Timing\nResponders and Non-Responders: A Spectrum\nCreatine and Bones\nCreatine in the Brain\nCreatine Side Effects\nCreatine Effects on Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, the Immune System, and Lung Function\nGain Strength, Lose Hair?\nCreatine and Caffeine\nConclusion\nAddendum: May 7, 2019\nSupplement this article with the podcast episode on the topic.\nRead Next\nOther Performance-Enhancing Mechanisms of Creatine\n\nWhile the rapid facilitation of ATP resynthesis is the primary and most straightforward ergogenic mechanism of creatine, there are two additional mechanisms that are less widely known and less frequently discussed. When ATP is used (hydrolyzed), it loses a phosphate group, but a hydrogen ion is also released in the process (Figure 1). Furthermore, anaerobic glycolysis is increased during high-intensity exercise, which further adds to the pool of hydrogen ions. During exercise, accumulation of hydrogen ions results in acidosis, which is associated with the onset of fatigue. When phosphocreatine donates its phosphate group to reform ATP from ADP, a hydrogen ion is consumed in the process. As a result, hydrogen buffering might be a secondary mechanism by which creatine supplementation helps to delay fatigue during intense exercise. Without question, creatine’s direct role in ATP production is the major mechanism by which it improves high-intensity exercise. However, when studies show that creatine enhances short-term, high-intensity exercise that is likely to induce a great deal of acidosis within the muscle, it is possible that pH buffering is making a small contribution to this effect. Frankly, if you’re doing anything at high enough intensity to induce substantial acidosis, you should probably already be taking creatine for its ATP-recycling effects. Nonetheless, if this newfound knowledge of creatine’s pH buffering capacity is the final piece of information required to get you on board with the premise of creatine supplementation, then it is worth drawing attention to.\n\nFigure 1. Creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (PCr) play a critical role in regenerating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Along with inorganic phosphate (Pi ), the hydrolysis of ATP releases a hydrogen ion (H+), which contributes to acidosis. The recycling of ADP to ATP consumes a hydrogen ion in the process, thereby contributing (to a small extent) to the attenuation of acidosis induced by high-intensity exercise.\n\nCreatine has long been known to increase body mass. After only a week of creatine loading, body mass is often increased by 1-2kg, and this rapid increase is attributable to water retention. Creatine is osmolytic; this means that, similarly to glycogen, increased storage of muscle creatine draws water into the muscle cell. As such, short-term loading interventions often cause up to 1-2 liters of water retention. Aside from this water-induced weight gain, and aside from potential hypertrophic adaptations to creatine-induced improvements in training capacity, there is some evidence to suggest that creatine has some direct effects on muscle hypertrophy. As reviewed by Chilibeck et al, creatine may also promote increases in lean body mass by directly affecting myostatin, myogenic regulatory factors, insulin-like growth factor 1, reactive oxygen species, and satellite cell activation. Satellite cell activation is a key step in training-induced hypertrophy; when a muscle is exercised or injured, satellite cells increase the number of myonuclei in the muscle, which increase the muscle’s capacity for protein synthesis. A number of myogenic regulatory factors play a role in promoting satellite cell activation, whereas myostatin inhibits activation. Creatine is thought to directly increase the production of myogenic regulatory factors by increasing cellular swelling via intracellular water storage, and indirectly increase their production by increasing levels of insulin-like growth factor 1. Creatine has also been shown to decrease myostatin activity, thereby simultaneously promoting factors that increase satellite cell activation and inhibiting factors that reduce satellite cell activation. Finally, excessive production of reactive oxygen species promotes inflammation and atrophy; by scavenging reactive oxygen species, creatine has the potential to reduce oxidative stress and inhibit atrophy, ultimately facilitating muscle growth.  \n\nWhen studies of considerable length (more than just a few weeks) document weight gain in response to creatine supplementation, this weight gain is sometimes written off as “just water weight” or exclusively attributed to creatine-induced improvements in training volume. Research would suggest that such conclusions fail to acknowledge the likelihood that creatine has more direct effects on promoting muscle hypertrophy, and they discount a mechanism that might contribute to creatine’s benefits for strength and power performance. For more on the impact of creatine on muscle growth, you may enjoy this article, which discusses the results of a recent meta-analysis on the topic.\n\nWhich Type of Creatine is Best?\n\nCreatine monohydrate is the typical, “standard” form of creatine supplement. It was the first to hit the literature, it’s the most affordable, and it’s the most widely studied type of creatine to date. Literally hundreds of studies have shown creatine monohydrate to effectively increase muscle creatine storage and enhance physical performance. However, a wide variety of creatine variations have been evaluated in the search for the best type of creatine. There is no shortage of potential creatine variations, but the ones that have picked up the most steam include creatine citrate, creatine ethyl ester, creatine nitrate, and buffered forms of creatine. The quest for the best creatine serves as a case study that demonstrates two important concepts: don’t focus on mechanisms over outcomes, and don’t search for solutions until you find a problem. Every time a new form of creatine comes around, it comes with technical explanations of why it could or should outperform creatine monohydrate. So far, none of them have been shown to consistently and substantially increase creatine retention, performance, or anything other than price, in comparison to creatine monohydrate. More importantly, these various creatine “solutions” seem to be addressing a non-problem. Creatine monohydrate is quite effective at saturating muscle creatine storage and increasing performance; even if a more effective type of creatine were to come along, it’s hard to imagine it’d do much beyond allowing slightly quicker saturation, a slightly higher (but physiologically irrelevant) degree of saturation, or saturation at a lower daily dose. Despite my skepticism, I’m always open to changing my mind if some incredible form of creatine comes along. But for now, creatine monohydrate is the most well-studied, effective, and affordable type of creatine on the market. If you are really concerned about fully maximizing creatine retention, some research has shown that the addition of carbohydrate (or carbohydrate + protein) improves retention a little bit, but (in my opinion) not enough to really care about.\n\nWhile the exact type of creatine is not particularly important, the physical state (solid versus liquid) certainly is. Creatine monohydrate powder is remarkably stable; at a temperature of 40° Celsius (104° Fahrenheit), virtually no breakdown is observed over the course of three years. In storage temperatures as high as 60° Celsius (140° Fahrenheit), breakdown starts to be observed after 44 months of heat exposure. In contrast, creatine is quite unstable in liquid solution, especially in the context of high temperatures and/or low pH. Substantial creatine breakdown occurs after only a few days in liquid solutions, even in room-temperature solutions with fairly neutral pH levels. As a result, the best course of action would be to purchase creatine in solid (powder or capsule) form, store it in room temperature conditions (or colder), and consume it immediately after mixing it into a liquid solution. If you must mix the beverage hours before consuming it, using a non-acidic liquid would be preferred, and it should be stored at a cold temperature if possible.\n\nQuick Note: If you’re interested in dialing in your nutrition, check out our app MacroFactor.

Loading is a popular method, which involves taking very high creatine doses (20-25 grams per day, split between 4-5 doses) for 4-7 days in a row. After this loading phase, muscle creatine storage is saturated, and a maintenance dose of 2-5 grams per day is taken thereafter. While loading is certainly effective, it is not necessarily required. Research has shown that moderate daily doses of 3 grams per day can saturate muscle creatine storage after about 3-4 weeks of supplementation (Figure 2). When deciding whether or not to load, the primary factors to consider are time and gastrointestinal comfort. If you really, really need your results to be maximized within seven days of supplementation, loading would be the way to go. However, mild gastrointestinal discomfort is often observed with creatine supplementation; if your stomach struggles with taking in 20-25 grams of creatine over the course of a day, then loading would not be your best bet, and a more patient approach would be preferable.\n\nFigure 2. With creatine supplementation, saturating muscle creatine and phosphocreatine storage is the name of the game. While high-dose loading protocols achieve full saturation more rapidly, you can still obtain the same degree of saturation by taking a more conservative maintenance dose for 3-4 weeks.\n\nOur bodies are pretty good at regulating things. For example, consider a healthy person that uses exogenous estrogen or testosterone; in both cases, administration of these hormones causes inhibition of the feedback loop that promotes their endogenous production. As a result, some have argued that creatine supplementation might suppress endogenous creatine production and should be cycled to prevent long-term downregulation of creatine production. It is true that supplementation with typical doses of creatine reduces short-term production of creatine. However, this is not necessarily a problem if endogenous production recovers after the cessation of supplementation. After all, there is no need to continue producing a great deal of creatine when you’ve got 5 grams (or more) coming in every day. Fortunately, endogenous production kicks right back in when you stop taking creatine, and studies have found no evidence to suggest that long-term creatine supplementation impairs creatine production after supplementation has ceased. In this sense, the only reasons to cycle creatine would be that you’re tired of reminding yourself it take it every day, or you don’t feel like spending the money to replenish your creatine stash.  \n\nThe final dosing consideration with creatine pertains to the time at which creatine is ingested. Countless studies have shown creatine to be efficacious with a wide range of supplement timing approaches. There are very few studies (three, to be precise) directly comparing the effects of pre-exercise creatine supplementation to post-exercise supplementation. The results of these three studies were combined in a small meta-analysis. The results suggested that post-exercise supplementation may lead to slightly greater increases in fat-free mass, with no significant difference observed for effects on strength. The body of literature on this topic is extremely small, so I am hesitant to make firm conclusions, and we have plenty of evidence showing creatine supplementation to be efficacious with a variety of timing strategies. So, taking creatine at a convenient time seems to be entirely sufficient, but it might be prudent to take creatine post-workout if you’re super concerned about fully maximizing the benefit of creatine supplementation. As discussed in the section on types of creatine, I see the topic of creatine timing as a bit of a non-issue. In the quest for perfect creatine timing, we seek to boost creatine monohydrate from “very effective” to “maybe slightly more effective.” Creatine monohydrate, regardless of specific timing strategies, does a very suitable job of saturating muscle creatine storage.\n\nResponders and Non-Responders: A Spectrum\n\nI get a kick out of kinesiology papers that arbitrarily describe “responders” and “non-responders” to an intervention. In the absence of a reasonably well-justified statistical process for categorization or a well-defined physiological basis for this grouping, it often ends up being a tool for researchers to say, “this totally worked, there was just something wrong with about half of our sample.” In the case of creatine, however, there is a well-defined physiological basis for non-response, and non-responders absolutely do exist.\n\nFor creatine to improve performance, it needs to meaningfully increase muscle creatine storage. Some people walk around with (just about) fully topped-off muscle creatine saturation, so they obtain no benefit from creatine supplementation. One of the early studies on creatine supplementation measured both muscle creatine content and the rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise. Five of their subjects had 25% greater creatine storage and 35% greater phosphocreatine resynthesis after supplementation, but three subjects (37.5% of the sample) did not have substantial increases in either outcome. About a decade later, another research team found that there were three “types” of responses in their study. Of the eleven total subjects, three (27% of the sample) had quite large increases in muscle creatine storage after supplementation, five (45%) had moderate (but substantial) increases, and three (27%) had very minimal increases. Furthermore, the responders improved their leg press after the five-day supplementation intervention, whereas the non-responders did not. Non-responders tended to be people who started the intervention with higher baseline levels of muscle creatine, fewer type 2 muscle fibers, smaller muscle cross-sectional area, and less fat-free mass than the responders. These characteristics provide some helpful information for determining your likelihood of being a non-responder and also help explain why multiple studies have shown creatine supplementation to have larger effects in vegetarians than meat eaters. The prevalence of non-responders reported by these studies suggest that non-responders are certainly not rare, which may be one of several factors contributing to the fact that about 30% of the first few hundred creatine studies did not report significant ergogenic effects. Finally, it’s important to note that non-response to creatine is really a spectrum rather than a rigid category. Some respond extremely favorably, some have virtually no response, and most others fall somewhere in the middle. So when we use the term “non-responder” in the literature, we’re talking about people who display a level of response that most would consider negligible in magnitude.\n\nI’m hesitant to use these studies to estimate the exact percentage of people that are likely to be non-responders. These samples are very small and not truly sampled from the general population at random. When samples are this small, three out of eight can very easily turn into one out of eight or five out of eight, based purely on chance alone. In that scenario, 13% easily becomes 63%, and the global population of non-responders goes from about one billion to about five billion. However, we can fairly comfortably conclude that being a non-responder is by no means rare, but does not appear to be the norm. So, the current “best guess” is around 20-30%, and we can feel pretty confident that the number is probably above 10% and below 50%. In my experience, people who suspect they are non-responders often feel disappointed that they don’t get to join in on the fun and enjoy a performance boost from creatine supplementation. In reality, being a non-responder is great news. You were genetically pre-selected to win a lifetime supply of free creatine!\n\nCreatine and Bones\n\nBones don’t really get enough credit (or attention). Much like muscle, bone is a metabolically active tissue that exhibits pronounced adaptations in response to resistance training. In the last decade or so, some of the creatine research has started to drift away from muscle and toward bone. The reasoning for this line of inquiry is two-fold. First, resistance training increases muscle mass and strength. As a result, the amount of strain on bones during resistance exercise is increased, and bone strain stimulates bone accretion. Second, bones are metabolically active tissues that rely on ATP. Phosphocreatine’s role in ATP resynthesis should reinforce the ATP supply available for bone cells, which may promote bone formation and reduce bone resorption. As reviewed by Forbes et al, there are a few studies showing reduced levels of a protein associated with bone resorption following creatine supplementation with resistance training compared to resistance training alone. These findings suggest that bone resorption was reduced, which would likely promote increased bone content and density.  \n\nA recent meta-analysis evaluated five studies on creatine supplementation with resistance training in older adults. Pooled analysis did not support the hypothesis that the addition of creatine would enhance bone mineral density, but the details suggest that hope is not entirely lost. There were a few key details that seemed to dictate which studies showed creatine to be beneficial. For example, only one study was a full year in duration, while the others were all six months or less. Bone is metabolically active and responsive to external stimuli, but it’s still pretty damn slow; it takes quite a while to see really substantial changes in bone remodeling, especially when you’re trying to find an effect of creatine that goes “above and beyond” the robust initial changes expected with the onset of resistance exercise. In line with this logic, the sole 12-month study reported a significant beneficial effect on bone density with creatine supplementation. Another key factor appears to be training frequency; while some studies in the meta-analysis had participants perform resistance training 1.5-2 days per week, two studies employed a training frequency of three workouts per week. Both studies with higher frequency observed beneficial effects on bone density or bone mineral content, despite that fact that one of the studies was only three months in duration. In addition, these higher-frequency studies also gave creatine doses that were scaled to body weight (~0.1 gram/kilogram), while the remaining studies (which found no significant benefit) gave a flat 5 gram dose of creatine. As such, it is possible that the flat 5 gram dose of creatine was a bit underdosed for larger individuals in the studies reporting no significant benefit.  \n\nTaken together, the results would suggest that creatine is most likely to benefit bone in the context of higher frequency resistance training (at least three days per week), when dosed at ~0.1 g/kg of body weight. In addition, the mechanism by which creatine affects bone turnover appears to be more anti-catabolic than anabolic in nature. As such, greater effects are likely to be observed in contexts in which bone turnover is accelerated or bone loss is more pronounced, such as prolonged weight loss, particularly rigorous training, or aging.\n\nCreatine in the Brain\n\nWe have long known that creatine plays a critically important role in the brain. While the brain’s pool of creatine only represents about 5% of the total creatine in the human body, the effects of brain creatine deficiency are devastating. There are congenital medical conditions that cause creatine deficiency in the brain, either due to impaired synthesis or impaired transport. When a child is born with such a condition, severe effects on cognitive function and development are often observed. Even in the absence of inborn creatine synthesis or transport deficiencies, researchers have suggested that creatine may play an important role in the severity and progression of a wide variety of brain-related pathologies, including traumatic brain injuries, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Research has shown that creatine supplementation may increase brain creatine and phosphocreatine storage by up to 10%; as such, the questions asked by creatine researchers have begun migrating from the muscle to the mind.\n\nThe putative benefits of creatine supplementation relate to creatine’s ability to facilitate ATP resynthesis. The brain is one of our most metabolically active tissues and comes with a massive burden for energy production. It is always on, whether it is preventing you from sleeping as you consider all of your life’s most soul-crushing regrets, or it is simply reminding your body to breathe and initiate heart beats while you’re watching television. Creatine in the brain functions as an imperative energy source to ensure that neurons always have sufficient ATP to support their metabolic activity; a shortage of brain creatine presents an energy crisis, with damaging effects on the function and integrity of neurons lacking energy. Under normal conditions, cognitive tasks elevate brain activity, thereby increasing ATP demand. As explained by Dolan et al, the role of creatine in facilitating ATP resynthesis is elevated when these cognitive tasks become more complex or are challenged by acute stressors such as sleep deprivation, hypoxia, or fatigue. A recent systematic review summarized the effects of creatine supplementation on cognitive function in healthy people; results indicated that creatine improved performance on tests pertaining to short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning fairly consistently. While some positive findings have been reported for other cognitive outcomes, such as long-term memory, spatial memory, response inhibition, reaction time, and mental fatigue, these outcomes are improved less consistently. The review also found that creatine supplementation was more likely to improve cognitive function in older adults compared to younger adults and in vegans and vegetarians compared to meat-eaters.\n\nThe progression and severity of several brain pathologies are directly tied to mitochondrial dysfunction and impairment of ATP production. As such, there is great interest in how the ATP-buffering effects of creatine may relate to brain function, both in health and disease. The progression and severity of brain injuries and many neurodegenerative diseases are also linked to oxidative stress; as a result, it has been suggested that creatine may confer brain benefits via antioxidant effects in addition to other potential non-energetic mechanisms. When it comes to brain injuries, such as ischemia and mild traumatic brain injuries (concussions), animal research indicates that creatine supplementation may reduce injury severity and improve recovery. While it’s difficult to do human research in which serious brain injuries are intentionally induced, these animal studies demonstrate that creatine’s effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics and oxidative stress have potential to attenuate the damage resulting from brain injuries. Human research has also shown benefits of creatine supplementation for humans with inborn creatine synthesis deficiencies, thus demonstrating that oral creatine supplementation can influence brain creatine levels to a clinically meaningful degree, at least in extreme cases. Several animal studies have suggested that creatine may have a promising therapeutic role for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and ALS. Human trials have failed to identify benefits of creatine for ALS; results from studies on Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease have been slightly more promising, particularly when treatment begins before the onset of clinical symptoms, but results have been underwhelming in general.\n\nWhile the creatine literature pertaining to brain function is fairly thin, Dolan et al provide a concise summary of what we know so far. Studies tend to show that creatine has minimal effects on cognitive function in relatively unstressed states, but its effects become more apparent in the context of stressors. Acute stressors include things like sleep deprivation, fatigue, hypoxia, and concussions; chronic stressors include things like inborn creatine deficiency, depression, and aging. Cognitive benefits of creatine appear to be more pronounced in older adults and vegetarians in comparison to young adults and meat-eaters. There is reason to have hope for creatine as a modestly beneficial adjunct therapy for managing progression and symptoms of certain neurological diseases, but more research is needed to verify the utility of this potential application.\n\nCreatine Side Effects\n\nIf you Google creatine side effects, a pretty wide range of results tend to pop up. Muscle cramping, kidney issues, liver issues, dehydration, weight gain, and gastrointestinal symptoms are listed most frequently. Luckily, several hundred creatine studies have been conducted over the last few decades, with some studies lasting up to five years in duration. So, we have a pretty good idea of what creatine does (and does not) cause.\n\nIntuitively, the liver and kidney concerns make sense. The liver and kidney are involved in creatine production and metabolite clearance, and small changes in select biomarkers associated with the function of each organ have been observed. However, more rigorous tests of organ function have, time and time again, failed to document any deleterious effect of creatine supplementation on healthy livers or kidneys in humans consuming creatine at ergogenic doses. For example, one of our creatine studies documented an increase in serum creatinine levels. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine, and is used as a marker of kidney function under normal circumstances. However, using creatinine to make inferences about kidney function absolutely and unequivocally relies on the assumption that you are not taking large doses of creatine. As a result, high creatinine values during creatine supplementation are to be expected, and they simply reflect that you have violated an enormous assumption of the serum creatinine test. Abnormal blood test results should never be ignored, but more rigorous testing is required to effectively evaluate kidney function in this case. When it comes to kidney and liver function, thorough assessments have repeatedly shown no harm of creatine supplementation in otherwise healthy individuals.\n\nMuch of the discussion about creatine side effects can be attributed to anecdotes and case reports in which creatine has been hastily blamed or implicated. A great example of this is a case study that was discussed in a review by Rawson et al. The patient in the case study presented with rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney failure. The authors of the report felt so strongly about creatine’s role in promoting the case of rhabdomyolysis that creatine was specifically named in the title of the study. However, it’s worth considering that creatine has been studied hundreds of times, using thousands of participants, and I can’t recall reading about a single instance of rhabdomyolysis in any of these studies. Furthermore, the patient in the case study had recently received intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, undergone a surgery that included the use of a tourniquet, and skied into a tree, which are all tremendously plausible ways to get rhabdomyolysis. It is from anecdotes like these that we see creatine linked to outcomes like dehydration and muscle cramping. Several research studies have confirmed that creatine does not adversely affect outcomes relating to hydration, muscle cramping, or muscle injury. In fact, some research even shows creatine supplementation to reduce the incidence of heat illness/dehydration, muscle cramps, and injuries in competitive football players. The idea of creatine inducing dehydration is a particularly curious notion, as creatine robustly and reliably increases intracellular and total body water. As such, creatine has been shown on multiple occasions to actually enhance hydration status and thermoregulatory responses to exercise in the heat, thereby exerting a protective effect rather than a harmful effect.\n\nCreatine does not appear to induce kidney damage, liver damage, rhabdomyolysis, dehydration, muscle cramping, or muscle strains in otherwise healthy individuals. There are some select kidney and liver pathologies in which creatine supplementation may be contraindicated, so anyone with a pre-existing liver or kidney issue would be wise to consult with a physician before beginning creatine supplementation. Nonetheless, creatine appears to do no harm to otherwise healthy kidneys and livers, and it may even prevent the pathological accumulation of liver fat. Furthermore, it does not impair the body’s ability to make creatine after supplementation has stopped. That is not to say, however, that creatine is entirely without side effects. Some people consider weight gain via water retention to be a side effect, and this certainly occurs for most individuals. It’s also fairly common to observe gastrointestinal discomfort with creatine supplementation; this effect is likely exacerbated if the creatine is poorly dissolved, consumed in large doses, or simultaneous ingested with a lot of caffeine. Finally, there are some fairly specific topics in which creatine’s effects are a bit complicated, and more detailed discussion is warranted. These topics include creatine’s role in immune responses and asthma, the effects of creatine on hair loss, and the potential for caffeine to interfere with the effects of creatine.\n\nCreatine Effects on Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, the Immune System, and Lung Function\n\nWhen researchers study inflammation, a common method is to cause inflammation in the paw of a lab rodent and measure the ensuing inflammation-induced edema (swelling). This tends to cause responses from a whole host of inflammatory mediators including histamine, prostaglandins, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and a variety of interleukins, and toll-like receptors are heavily involved in the process. As reviewed by Riesberg et al, early rodent studies found that both injected and orally consumed creatine attenuated inflammatory responses when multiple models of acute inflammation were tested. The results also seem to pan out for chronic inflammation; creatine has been shown to have favorable effects on the progression of arthritis using two different rodent models of arthritis. Most importantly, human trials have shown these effects to translate to exercise; studies have demonstrated that creatine reduces markers of inflammation following a 30km race, a half-Ironman triathlon, and a running-based anaerobic test. Creatine may also influence oxidative stress. Numerous studies using cell cultures have shown creatine to protect incubated cells from oxidative damage, and a study in rats demonstrated that 28 days of creatine supplementation had an antioxidant effect on the response to acute exercise. Unfortunately, human research on this topic is fairly limited. One study found a significant reduction in the oxidative stress response to a single bout of resistance exercise in resistance-trained males following creatine supplementation, but a couple of studies have failed to find such benefits. Creatine also appears to modulate immune system activity; treating vascular endothelial cells with creatine (in vitro) reduces adhesion of immune cells, which would theoretically be beneficial with regards to the development of atherosclerotic plaque.\n\nAs one might expect, alterations in inflammation, immune function, and oxidative stress are not all unequivocally good things. For instance, a previous review has noted that these effects could collectively have an immunosuppressive effect. Few creatine studies are long enough to make meaningful inferences about illness rates, and illness rates are rarely reported in the few creatine studies that are long enough. A three-year study in college football players found no increase in the prevalence of illness among creatine users, but previously documented immunosuppressive effects could potentially be more meaningful for people with compromised immune systems. Creatine has also been shown to exacerbate changes in airway remodeling and allergic/inflammatory responses in rodent models of asthma. However, research has also shown that aerobic exercise helps to attenuate these negative effects of creatine on asthma-related breathing complications. Furthermore, creatine’s effects for people with lung conditions are not all negative; small, preliminary studies in humans have suggested that creatine has modest beneficial effects for training adaptations and well-being in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, although lung function was neither positively nor negatively affected in either study. In conclusion, creatine appears to influence immune function, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The potential downsides of creatine with regard to asthma and the immune system are not fully understood yet; nonetheless, if I had asthma or a similar allergy-related inflammatory condition or had a clinically compromised immune system, I would personally err on the side of caution and shy away from creatine supplementation. Aside from those special cases, the effects of creatine on immune function, inflammation, oxidative stress, and lung function appear to be either modestly beneficial or neutral.\n\nGain Strength, Lose Hair?\n\nIf you’ve ever heard that creatine is linked to hair loss, there is a research study that provides the basis for this purported link. A 2009 study investigated the effects of a one-week creatine loading period, plus two weeks of maintenance supplementation, on blood androgen levels in 18- to 19-year-old male rugby players. Several previous studies have evaluated the effects of creatine on testosterone levels, with the majority finding no significant effect. While this study also found no effect on testosterone, a significant increase in dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was observed. This is notable, because DHT is known to play a very direct role in male hair loss. Testosterone is converted to DHT by an enzyme called 5ɑ-reductase; when DHT binds to receptors on hair follicles, hair loss is promoted via miniaturization of the hair follicle.\n\nIn the study, subjects started the placebo protocol with a baseline DHT value of 1.26 nmol/L; DHT levels dropped to 1.09 by day 7, and to 1.06 by day 21. It was a crossover trial, so the exact same subjects also completed the creatine protocol. At the beginning of the creatine supplementation phase, baseline DHT was 0.98 nmol/L; it increased to 1.53 by day 7, and settled back to 1.38 by day 21. It’s important to note that values up to around 3.0-3.5 nmol/L are considered “normal,” and DHT levels in the creatine study were fairly unstable. For instance, the baseline differences between the treatments, which should (theoretically) be just about equal, differed by nearly 0.3 nmol/L, and DHT should have been reasonably stable throughout the placebo protocol, but dropped by 0.2 nmol/L. As such, it’s difficult to get too worked up about the findings in the creatine condition, in which a curiously low baseline value (0.98 nmol/L) increased dramatically at the one-week time point before settling back to 1.38 nmol/L, which is only 0.12 nmol/L higher than the baseline value during the placebo protocol. It is also worth noting that both acute and chronic exercise increase male DHT levels; in theory, a modest increase in DHT could potentially be attributed to a creatine-induced increase in training load.\n\nAt this point, I’m aware of only one study measuring DHT changes in response to creatine supplementation. The study documented an increase, but DHT levels remained well within the normal range. Further, there are many steps that separate blood DHT levels from hair loss; in order to induce hair loss, the DHT must actually bind to the appropriate receptors on hair follicles and induce the miniaturization of hair follicles. It’s unclear whether or not this magnitude of effect on DHT would have a measurable effect on the rate of hair loss in genetically predisposed individuals. There is certainly no reason to believe that creatine would cause hair loss in individuals who are not genetically predisposed to hair loss. At this time, there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that DHT accelerates hair loss in genetically predisposed individuals, but it is not an entirely far-fetched idea, and there is definitely enough evidence to warrant further investigation.\n\nCreatine and Caffeine\n\nBack in the mid-90s, when creatine research was just starting to gather some steam, a research group suspected that caffeine might improve creatine absorption if they were consumed together. Creatine enters muscle cells via specific, sodium-dependent transporters. As such, the group suspected that caffeine would increase the activity of sodium-potassium ATPase pumps, which would theoretically increase creatine transporter activity (and muscle creatine uptake) by increasing the sodium gradient across the muscle membrane. The researchers were surprised to find that the addition of caffeine had no effect on muscle creatine uptake; muscle creatine storage was effectively increased by creatine supplementation, with or without added caffeine. However, the researchers were even more surprised to find that the addition of caffeine appeared to block the performance-enhancing benefit of creatine supplementation. Even though muscle creatine storage was significantly elevated, the creatine and caffeine treatment did not improve performance on the leg extension exercise test compared to the placebo treatment, while the creatine-only treatment did significantly improve performance. As one might expect, their discussion of the results offered very few concrete suggestions for why this was observed, as it was the complete opposite of what they expected to find.\n\nSix years later, the same research group did another study after brainstorming some potential mechanisms by which caffeine could block the performance effects of creatine. In this follow-up study, they analyzed the effects of creatine and caffeine on muscle relaxation time. In theory, reduced relaxation time is a good thing. Crossbridge cycling (repeated attachment, detachment, and reattachment of actin-myosin crossbridges) is how force production happens, and crossbridges need to detach before they reattach again. Slowed (i.e., increased) muscle relaxation time is a well-known consequence of fatigue, and more rapid detachment could therefore be conducive to generating high forces in a short amount of time via an increased rate of crossbridge cycling and enhanced recovery time between contractions in rapid succession. In the follow-up study, this research group found that creatine alone reduces relaxation time, while chronic (multiple-day) use of caffeine alone actually increases relaxation time. When caffeine was chronically consumed during the creatine loading period, creatine’s effect on muscle relaxation time was blunted, and relaxation time was not significantly reduced. In this sense, the research group had followed up with a plausible mechanism to explain their previous finding.\n\nWhile this pair of studies would appear to tell a fairly concise story about caffeine blocking the ergogenic effect of creatine via prolonged muscle relaxation time, there might be more to the story. Roger Harris pretty much introduced creatine to the sport science research world, so his input on creatine carries as much weight as anybody’s. After the creatine and caffeine issue started getting some buzz, his group did a small study to see if they found similar effects, which they published in abstract form. Again, using a leg extension protocol, yet another study showed creatine to be effective, whereas the addition of caffeine throughout creatine loading blunted this ergogenic effect. Interestingly, this study reported that four out of ten participants who completed the study complained of gastrointestinal discomfort, which was notably more prevalent when caffeine was ingested with creatine compared to creatine alone. This is not the only study to observe gastrointestinal discomfort in response to the combination of creatine and caffeine; Quesada and Gillum reported similar discomfort in three out of seven subjects, and our group noted the same observation in four out of thirteen subjects.\n\nPeople love creatine, and they love caffeine. Suggesting that they might have to pick one or the other is like telling them to choose the favorite of their two children. As a result, there are a lot of people who simply refuse to entertain the possibility that caffeine could blunt the performance effects of creatine supplementation. There are a few arguments commonly used to suggest that the creatine and caffeine issue is quite simple and no interaction exists. The first argument pertains to the fact that many early creatine studies allowed, and even encouraged, participants to mix their creatine into hot coffee and/or tea. The recommendation made sense at the time, as creatine dissolves much more effectively in a hot beverage. However, this logic isn’t exactly air-tight. A cup of coffee or tea may yield up to 100mg of caffeine, give or take; this is a far cry from the 5 mg/kg dose used in many of the studies showing a creatine-caffeine interaction. In addition, it’d be wildly inaccurate to view coffee or tea as “caffeine water” and ignore the hundreds of bioactive compounds in each. It’s not implausible to think that one of these many compounds may alter the relationship between creatine and caffeine, or exert independent effects of their own.\n\nThe second argument suggests that the “interaction” observed in the creatine/caffeine studies is actually attributable to caffeine withdrawal. This argument contends that providing caffeine for a few days in a row promotes physiological dependence. To circumvent confounding results from the acute ergogenic effects of caffeine, many of the creatine/caffeine studies would disallow caffeine within several hours of exercise testing, which could theoretically hinder performance due to withdrawal symptoms. However, the abstract published by Harris’ group casts doubt on this argument. They tested performance two hours following a caffeine dose, and again a day after caffeine supplementation ceased. The interference between caffeine and creatine was actually more apparent during the testing that occurred two hours after a caffeine dose, a time at which subjects would be far less vulnerable to performance-disrupting withdrawal symptoms than the testing occurring 24 hours after. The third argument is fairly simple: studies have shown multi-ingredient pre-workout supplements, containing both creatine and caffeine, to be effective ergogenic aids. This argument assumes that the creatine actually played a role in the ergogenic effect observed, on top of the benefits subjects may have been obtaining from the caffeine, beta-alanine, and 26 other ergogenic aids included in the formula. This argument also ignores the fact that most multi-ingredient pre-workout supplements also include way less creatine and caffeine than the doses in which the interaction has been observed.   \n\nFor a more thorough look at the research question, check out the full-length review paper I published a few years ago. More research is needed on this topic, but Figure 3 summarizes our current understanding. So far, the handful of studies on habitually consuming ergogenic doses of caffeine during creatine loading have either found caffeine to block the performance benefit of creatine, or they have reported no effect of creatine itself; none of them have shown creatine to work despite the addition of high-dose caffeine. The reason for this is up for debate. Some have proposed that caffeine’s diuretic effect opposes the water retention effect of creatine, but we know that their co-ingestion does not alter each others’ pharmacokinetic properties, we know that caffeine does not alter muscle creatine saturation, and I struggle to see how this would have a meaningful impact on performance. While there may be some merit to opposing effects on muscle relaxation time, the combination of high doses of creatine (typically upwards of 10 grams per day) and caffeine (typically up around 5 mg/kg per day) seem to commonly induce gastrointestinal discomfort in around 30-40% of (admittedly small) samples. The case is not closed, but I am increasingly convinced that the creatine/caffeine issue boils down to gastrointestinal discomfort; it’s hard to perform at your best under those circumstances. The most conservative approach would be to fully trust the small amount of data available, accept that caffeine blunts the ergogenic effects of creatine, and pick one or the other. A more moderate approach (and my current approach) would be to keep an eye on gastrointestinal symptoms and alter the dosing and timing of creatine and caffeine accordingly. Such an approach would probably favor restricting high-dose caffeine during loading (or favor the avoidance of loading), keeping caffeine near the lower end of the ergogenic range (3-5 mg/kg), and consuming your creatine and caffeine at different times throughout the day. A third approach would be to simply ignore the data available and assume that no interaction exists, mostly because it feels better and saves you from a difficult decision. Again, I think the more moderate approach provides a prudent strategy that avoids extreme knee-jerk reactions to a small (but growing) body of evidence.\n\nFigure 3. Creatine and caffeine improve performance via distinct mechanisms. Intuitively, this would make them seem like an ideal supplement pairing. However, there is some evidence to suggest that habitual high-dose caffeine intake blunts the performance benefits of high-dose creatine loading. So far, the most plausible explanations for this interaction relate to opposing effects on muscle relaxation time and potential gastrointestinal discomfort when high doses of both ingredients are consumed. While more research on the topic is needed, this figure summarizes our current understanding of the issue. Adapted from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26219105\nConclusion\n\nIt’s pretty well-known that creatine supplementation increases muscle storage of free creatine and phosphocreatine, thereby increasing body weight, strength, and sprint performance. However, there’s a lot more to creatine than water retention and helping muscles create ATP during intense exercise, and there are a lot of questions that continue to be asked. Creatine affects a wide range of tissues, including the brain, the bones, and the lungs. Creatine influences inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune function. Questions pertaining to optimal forms of creatine, optimal dosing strategies, side effects, and interactions with other supplements linger. Our current understanding of creatine can be summarized as follows:\n\nCreatine improves high-intensity exercise performance, primarily by saturating muscle storage of free creatine and phosphocreatine, which enables rapid ATP recycling during exercise.\nNo form of creatine has been shown to meaningfully and consistently outperform creatine monohydrate. However, creatine monohydrate degrades pretty rapidly in liquid, so it should be mixed pretty close to the time of ingestion.\nLoading and cycling of creatine are fine, but not necessary.\nCreatine may confer modest benefits for bone and brain health.\nCreatine is largely free of side effects in healthy people, aside from occasional stomach discomfort. This discomfort can probably be attenuated by completely dissolving the creatine dose in liquid, avoiding doses above 5 grams at a time, and avoiding co-ingesting high doses (≥3-5 mg/kg) of caffeine at the same time. For individuals with asthma, compromised immune systems, or certain pre-existing kidney or liver conditions, more caution may be required with regards to side effects.\nOne study has shown creatine to increase DHT levels, but DHT remained within the normal reference range, and this does not necessarily equate to hair loss.\nA few studies have shown that high-dose caffeine blunts the performance benefits of creatine loading, but this might just relate to stomach discomfort caused by combining high doses of both ingredients. It’s possible that this can be avoided by implementing more strategic dosing approaches for both ingredients.\nAddendum: May 7, 2019\n\nAfter this article was published, we received a ton of questions about gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort in response to creatine ingestion. So, I wanted to give a little bit of information about how to avoid GI discomfort associated with creatine supplementation.\n\nAs previously noted, there is some evidence suggesting that ingesting loading doses of creatine (i.e., 20+ grams per day) in conjunction with daily ergogenic doses of caffeine anhydrous (i.e., 3-5+ mg per kg of body weight) may upset your stomach. Aside from being generally unpleasant, this could also have a negative effect on performance. There are a few ways to minimize this risk. The most extreme approach would be to avoid consuming caffeine while on creatine. A less extreme approach is to simply keep the dosages in check. For example, this may involve using a maintenance dose of creatine instead of loading, or restricting caffeine dosages to “normal” day-to-day levels (<3 mg/kg per day) that are likely to give you some energy, but unlikely to substantially enhance performance. An even less extreme approach would be to simply separate the timing of your doses; caffeine would ideally be consumed 30-90 minutes before a workout, with creatine consumed at other parts of the day. For a maintenance protocol of creatine supplementation, this could very easily be done by restricting caffeine to early parts of the day and consuming creatine in a single dose later in the evening. I tend to suspect that the latter approach (temporally separating doses) is likely sufficient, but there’s a lack of research available to make any type of firm evidence-based conclusion.\n\nNotably, there are plenty of people who experience stomach discomfort when consuming creatine, even in the absence of caffeine. In this case, there are a few strategies that may be helpful. Research has shown that stomach discomfort is much more likely when consuming a 10-gram dose of creatine once daily, compared to two, 5-gram doses consumed twice daily. So, dividing your creatine dose into multiple, smaller doses may help. If that still doesn’t do the trick, it may be worth lowering the total daily dose. If your stomach doesn’t tolerate a loading protocol for creatine very well, simply ingesting a maintenance dose for 3-4 weeks will get the same job done. Taking creatine on an empty stomach might also increase the likelihood of experiencing an upset stomach, so it’s probably a good idea to take creatine with food if you tend to notice stomach discomfort after supplementation. Finally, it’s likely that stomach issues will be exacerbated if the product is poorly dissolved when you ingest it. Creatine monohydrate is typically OK, but not great, in terms of its ability to fully dissolve. Adding your creatine to a hot beverage, such as coffee, tea, or hot water, greatly enhances its ability to dissolve rapidly. Again, you may prefer to use a decaffeinated beverage if you want to err on the side of caution.\n\nThere are some anecdotes floating around that alternate forms of creatine may minimize GI symptoms in comparison to creatine monohydrate. For some novel forms of creatine, such as creatine phosphate and magnesium creatine chelate, GI discomfort has been noted. For some of the more popular alternate forms of creatine, including creatine ethyl ester and alkaline buffered creatine, I am unaware of research directly comparing their GI effects in comparison to creatine monohydrate. However, creatine ethyl ester and alkaline buffered creatine appear to be more susceptible to breakdown to creatinine in the gut, and research has shown them to either be less effective or equally effective when compared to creatine monohydrate. Furthermore, while creatine monohydrate has a large body of evidence supporting its safety and efficacy, the same cannot be said for alternate forms of creatine. The solubility of creatine hydrochloride and micronized creatine monohydrate might be a little better than normal creatine monohydrate, but you could also obtain this enhancement in solubility by simply mixing regular creatine monohydrate into a warm beverage.\n\nSo, if you notice stomach discomfort when you take creatine, you’re not alone. Simple strategies to minimize the likelihood of discomfort include taking creatine with food, mixing it into a hot beverage, taking less daily creatine or splitting it into multiple smaller individual doses, opting for a micronized creatine monohydrate product, and avoiding large doses (3-5+ mg per kg of body weight) of caffeine when consuming your creatine. While it’s possible that some of the alternate forms of creatine may have greater water solubility or induce less GI distress, these alternate forms tend to have less research supporting their safety and efficacy.\n\n[feature_box style=”3″ only_advanced=”There%20are%20no%20title%20options%20for%20the%20choosen%20style” alignment=”center”]\n\n\nSupplement this article with the podcast episode on the topic.\n\nListen to Eric and Greg discuss the link between creatine and hair loss, the interaction between creatine and caffeine, and avoiding stomach discomfort when taking creatine on this episode of the Stronger By Science podcast.

    "content": "The Belt Bible\nby Greg Nuckols\nArticles, Technique\n\nWhat you’re getting yourself into:\n\n~4700 words, 15-18 minute read time\n\nThis is almost certainly the most thorough article on the web about the effects, benefits, and drawbacks of training with a belt.\n\nKey Points\n\n1) Wearing a belt improves your performance in the gym\n\n2) These performance increases likely mean increased size and strength in the long run\n\n3) There are still instances that it’s better to train beltless, but you should probably use a belt for the bulk of your training\n\n \n\nW\nhether or not you should wear a lifting belt is a surprisingly contentious subject.  Some people are adamant that you should always wear a belt with the opinion they dramatically decrease your injury risk.  Other people are adamant that you should never wear a belt, either because they think “it makes your core weak,” or because they think it’s a truer test of strength to see what you can lift without any external aid (though this article won’t be touching on that.  I just see that as a matter of personal preference and is, therefore, totally irrelevant for general recommendations).\n\nSo, how much of that is true?  Do belts make you safer?  Do belts make your core weaker?  This article is meant to answer those questions and explain the effects of a wearing a belt in quite a bit of detail.\n\nPerformance\n\nFirst, it should be a no-brainer that wearing a belt *generally* improves performance.  Yes, you can find examples of people lifting huge weights without a belt (like Konstantin Konstantinovs pulling 939 or Victor Naylekin squatting 903), but 99 people out of 100 can lift more with a belt than without one.  I’m not entirely sure why you’d compete in powerlifting without a belt (if you compete to put up the highest possible total within the bounds of the rules, not just to improve on your past total based on your own standards).  It’s hard to put a number on precisely how much more people can lift with a belt, but it seems to be at least 5-15% for most people who are accustomed to wearing a belt.\n\nHowever, there is a learning curve for most people.  Some people throw on a belt for the first time and hit PRs, but it usually takes people at least a few session to learn how to use it properly.  In fact, one study utilizing maximal isometric lifting (one back-dominant lift and one leg-dominant lift) found that people totally new to belt usage didn’t have any increase in maximal force or intraabdominal pressure.\n\nPictured: Most noobs don’t know how to put a belt to good use.\n\nBar speed\n\nSeveral studies have found that people complete lifts faster with a belt versus without one.  Now, this should also be obvious.  There’s a pretty tight relationship between bar speed and percentage of your 1rm.  Since you can generally lift more with a belt, then obviously you should be able to lift any given weight faster when wearing a belt.\n\nTo illustrate, one study using 90% of experienced lifters’ (average 1rm of ~315lbs) beltless max deadlift found that people reached peak ground reaction force about .3 seconds sooner in the lift when wearing a belt – they’re able to generate maximum force quicker as the bar breaks the floor.  Although total time to lift completion wasn’t affected in this study, other studies have shown that people tend to be weakest in the deadlift from off the floor to just below the knee, so it’s reasonable to assume the people wearing a belt “let up” at the top of the lift (unless you’re going to contend that wearing a belt makes lockout harder).\n\nAnother study using experienced lifters (minimum 8rm of 125.5kg or 1.6x bodyweight) found that people took about 6% less time to complete squats when wearing a belt, and that gap widened slightly as the set wore on, especially through the sticking point of the squat.\n\nYet another study with experienced lifters (average beltless 1rm of 156kg, or 1.8x bodyweight) found about a 9% decrease in time to complete the lift when performing squats with 90% beltless 1rm.\n\nIn the same study, average bar velocity during the concentric portion of the lift was about 15.5% faster when wearing a belt (.417 vs. .361 m/s).\n\nAgain, bar speed isn’t necessarily an important metric in and of itself.  However, since bar speed with a submaximal load correlates very strongly with 1rm strength, this data gives us our best – though indirect – insight into how much wearing a belt improves performance in experienced lifters who know how to use a belt properly.  The difference seems to be about 5-15%.\n\nIncreased reps with any absolute load\n\nThis is another benefit of wearing a belt that should be obvious.  However, I just want to briefly spell out why it’s important.\n\nAll other things being equal (same exercises, same ROM, etc.), the two most important factors influencing training adaptations (aka strength and mass gains) are training volume and intensity.  With a belt, you can either move 5-15% more weight for the same sets and reps, move the same weight for an extra 1-3 reps per set, or move the same weight for the same number of reps with less effort.  Those are all good things that add up to more strength and size for your prime movers (essentially your leg, hip, and back musculature) over time.\n\nTraining effect\n\nTo my knowledge, there haven’t been any studies conducted comparing one group of people training with a belt to another training without a belt for a prolonged period of time.  This is a major gap in the literature I’ll talk about more later.  Because of this, we have to make some assumptions about how well EMG data can be extrapolated into long-term training effects.  Luckily, there’s good reason to believe that EMG is a reliable predictor of long-term training effect for biomechanically similar movements (which certainly applies here, because there’s not a ton of difference between a squat or deadlift with a belt or without).  If you want to know more about EMG, I’d highly recommend this (incredibly thorough) article, but that’s not a rabbit hole worth going down in this article.\n\nAlso, just a note about the studies in this section:  the weights used were the same when wearing a belt vs. not wearing one, so the findings are comparing relatively easier belted lifts to relatively harder beltless lifts.  In all likelihood, the EMG readings when wearing a belt would be slightly higher if they were comparing the same relative intensity (i.e. 90% of a beltless 1rm vs. 90% of a beltled 1rm) rather than the same absolute intensity (i.e. 90% of a beltless 1rm either wearing a belt or not wearing one).\n\nSpinal Erectors\n\nData is somewhat mixed regarding EMG activity in the spinal erectors.\n\nStarting with deadlifts, one study utilizing experienced lifters (deadlift max of at least 1.5x bodyweight) found that iliocostalis lumbourum (a spinal erector muscle) activation was 15-20% lower when wearing a belt.  However, the load chosen for the study was 75% of the lifters’ body weight, or at most 50% of their max.\n\nAnother utilizing a maximal isometric back-dominant lift in untrained people found 17% higher spinal erector EMG activity when using a belt.\n\nFinally, another study utilizing deadlifts with 12rm (70-75% 1rm) loads in Division 1-A football players found no significant differences in spinal erector EMG activity.\n\nSo, taken as a whole, there’s at most a 20% swing either way, but in the study utilizing the most relevant protocol, (12rm loads in D-1 football players) there was no significant difference.\n\nMoving on to squats, one study utilizing a maximal isometric leg-dominant lift in untrained people found 18% higher spinal erector EMG activity when using a belt.\n\nAnother utilizing squats with 60% 1rm found 23% higher EMG activity in the spinal erectors when wearing a belt.\n\nFinally, two studies with well-trained subjects (8rm squat of at least 125.5kg or 1.6x bodyweight in one, and 1rm of 156kg and 1.8x bodyweight in the other) found no meaningful difference between spinal erector EMG activity when squatting with or without a belt with an 8rm load or a 90% 1rm load, while one found a small decrease when squatting a 90% load with a belt.\n\nSo, taken as a whole, wearing a belt when squatting may increase spinal erector EMG activity slightly in untrained subjects or with light loads, but for well-trained people squatting heavy loads, there’s probably no meaningful difference.\n\nLegs\n\nStarting with deadlifts, the study on D-1 football players with 12rm loads found no significant differences in quad, hamstrings, adductors, or gluteus maximus EMG activity.  I’m not aware of any other studies on deadlifts looking at EMG activity for the leg or hip muscles.\n\nFor squats, we have two studies, both with well-trained subjects.\n\nOne of them (sets of 8 with an 8rm load) found greater vastus lateralis (a quad muscle) activation through the sticking point of the squat when wearing a belt, and a greater increase in hamstring activation as the set progressed when wearing a belt. (If this study sounds familiar, it’s probably because I discussed it in depth previously here.)\n\nThe other (squats with 90% of beltless 1rm) found no significant EMG differences in the vastus lateralis, biceps femoris (a hamstrings muscle), adductor magnus, or gluteus maximus.\n\nThe reason for the different findings for the quads may be that the first study broke the concentric portion of the lift into thirds (out of the hole, through the sticking point, and finishing the lift), whereas the second simply looked at average EMG for the entire concentric portion of the lift.  In the first, there was no significant difference in vastus lateralis activation when looking at the entire concentric portion of the lift as a whole, but the difference was evident when specifically looking at the sticking point (where it matters most).\n\nInterestingly, the second study also measured front-to-back bar motion and found that there tends to be about 26% more when wearing a belt.  People tend to shift their weight slightly more forward when wearing a belt, perhaps allowing their quads to give them more assistance through the sticking point of the lift, without affecting activation of posterior chain musculature.\n\nThe reason for the different findings for the hamstrings may be that the first study (squatting 8 reps with 8rm loads) allowed the participants to fatigue as the set progressed, whereas the second study (one rep with 90% 1rm) didn’t.  In the first study, there was no difference in biceps femoris activation for the first two reps of the set, but as biceps femoris activation increased as the set wore on, it increased to a greater degree in the group wearing the belt.\n\nThe reason for the increased hamstrings activation as the set wore on is probably largely attributable to fatigue.  As the set progressed, forward lean increased by about 5 degrees.  As the prime movers (quads, glutes, adductor magnus) fatigued, the lifters had to rely more on their hamstrings, a muscle group typically used primarily to transfer force between the knee and hip, not as a prime mover itself.  The reason biceps femoris activation may have increased to a greater degree when wearing a belt is that your nervous system’s top priority is to not snap your spine.  The hamstrings pull the pelvis toward posterior tilt, and thus the lumbar spine into flexion.  With higher intraabdominal pressure when wearing a belt decreasing shear stress on the spine and stabilizing the pelvis, it may be that the nervous system is more apt to “allow” the hamstrings to contract harder since the top priority (protecting the spine) is taken care of.\n\nSo, to sum up this section, wearing a belt doesn’t affect the prime movers in the deadlift.  In the squat, wearing a belt may increase quad activation through the sticking point and may increase hamstring activation to a greater degree on the last few reps of a tough set, but probably not when doing singles or doing sets stopped well shy of failure.\n\nAbdominals\n\nThis is the piece most people have probably been waiting for, since the common objection is that “belts make your core weak.”\n\nStarting with the deadlift, one study utilizing a maximal isometric back-dominant lift in untrained people found slight (nonsignificant) increases in rectus abdominis (“six pack”) activity and decreases in external oblique activation when wearing a belt.\n\nAnother study utilizing D-1 football players lifting 12rm loads had the same findings, except that the differences did reach significance.\nSo, wearing a belt probably increases rectus abdominis activation slightly and decreases external oblique activation slightly, relative to deadlifting beltless.\n\nMoving on to the squat, one study utilizing a maximal isometric leg-dominant lift in untrained people found significantly (54%) higher rectus abdominis activity, and slightly (14%, nonsignificant) lower external oblique activation when wearing a belt.\n\nTwo studies in well-trained lifters (lifting 8rm loads or 90% 1rm loads) found no significant differences in external oblique activation.\n\nSo, taken as a whole, wearing a belt may increase rectus abdominis activation (although, to be honest, I’m not going to put a ton of faith in a single study on untrained lifters performing an isometric lift) and probably doesn’t affect external oblique activation.\n\nIt is very unlikely that squatting and deadlift with a belt “makes your core weak” or hinders gains in torso strength.\n\nSafety\n\nFirst and foremost, it’s really hard to say how wearing a belt affects injury risk in a gym setting because, to the best of my knowledge, no studies have been done on that subject, even though the majority of gym-goers who wear a belt say they do so for safety reasons rather than performance reasons.  There have been quite a few studies conducted in industrial workers who regularly have to lift and move heavy objects.  They tend to find no effect or small benefit, although some suggest that the main benefit is decreased risk of re-injury in people who had been previously injured, with no benefit to people who had never had a back injury, or even an increased injury risk when they stopped using a belt.\n\nDr. Stuart McGill, a (or the) foremost expert on spinal biomechanics, recommends against the use of a belt in most cases, even for lifters.  He states that to get the maximum effect out of a belt, it requires spinal flexion to take advantage of “elastic recoil of a bent torso that is stiffened with a belt. However, if a neutral spine is preserved throughout the lift, this effect is minimal. In other words, to obtain the maximal effect from a belt, the lifter must lift poorly and in a way that exposed the back to a much higher risk of injury!” (emphasis his).\n\nNow, at the risk of overstepping my bounds (because he’s Dr. McGill and I’m not), I’m not entirely sure I buy that explanation.  I don’t see many competitive lifters purposefully allowing spinal flexion (especially in the squat), but you’d be hard-pressed to find many who can’t lift at least 5-10% more with a belt.  That’s because there’s more to the performance benefits of wearing a belt than simply elastic recoil from a flexed torso, as we’ve already seen.\n\nSo, with Dr. McGill’s trepidation in mind (which I certainly take very seriously, though I don’t entirely agree with it), let’s move forward.\n\nThe major effect of wearing a belt is increased intraabdominal pressure.  The increase varies based on the type of belt used (a thin weightlifting-style belt may cause a smaller increase than a thicker powerlifting-style belt, though at least one study indicates there’s not meaningful difference) and the lift done.  For deadlifts, wearing a belt increases IAP by about 15%, and for squats, it increases IAP by about 30%–40% more than lifting heavy weights beltless.\n\nThis increase in IAP has two major effects, one good and one bad.  The good effect is that increased IAP counters shear stress on the spine.  The bad effect is that increased IAP may cause a higher spike in blood pressure when lifting.\n\nThere’s some mixed data on how wearing a belt affects spinal compression.  On one hand, Dr. McGill’s lab found that simply performing a valsalva maneuver increased pressure in the intervertebral discs.  On the other hand, a couple of studies have measured spinal shrinkage when lifting with a belt or training beltless, and they both found that wearing a belt decreased spinal shrinkage when lifting.  One of them found a ~25% difference in “trained” (but not very strong.  Average 10rm squat was 61kg, for reference) subjects when doing a circuit with 10rm loads.  The other found a much larger (~50%) difference, but the protocol used in the study was so bizarre I’m not sure if the results mean much for our purposes (8 sets of 20 deadlifts with 65 pounds).  In the first study, participants reported significantly more discomfort (not pain) when lifting beltless, and their degree of spinal shrinkage was significantly correlated with degree of reported discomfort.\n\nHow relevant all of this is to highly trained people is debatable.  Lumbar vertebrae and discs are well-built for handling compressive loads, and degree of spinal shrinkage is inversely related to back strength.\n\nThere are two things you could do with this information.  The first is recommend people wear a belt if they’re more comfortable lifting with a belt.  The second is to work on improving dynamic neuromuscular stabilization to improve comfort.  Personally, I’m a fan of both approaches:  Doing DNS work to improve comfort, but not shying away from belt usage if someone is more comfortable lifting with a belt, at least until intrinsic stabilization improves.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe first and most obvious limitation is that there haven’t been any long-term studies done (to the best of my knowledge) comparing adaptations of training with a belt versus training without one.  Although EMG data is useful, when talking about long-term training outcomes, it can only be used to discuss what will probably happen, but you should not hold any conclusions you reach with much temerity.\n\nAnother limitation is that people tend to use different bracing patterns when lifting with a belt versus lifting beltless.  With a belt, the common cue is to “push out against the belt.”  Since the belt doesn’t expand (hopefully), that creates intraabdominal pressure that helps stabilize the spine.  Without a belt, people usually recommend taking a deep belly breath (as you would with a belt), then using the abdominal musculature to “draw in” to create intraabdominal pressure.  For example, take a look at this (utterly ridiculous) beltless squat and notice how he’s clearly not pushing his stomach out the same way you would if you were wearing a belt.\n\nClick to accept marketing cookies and enable this content\n\nThese differences in bracing patterns could potentially lead to different long-term training adaptations and affect deep muscles that would be nearly impossible to pick up with EMG (unlike surface muscles such as the rectus abdominis or external oblique).\n\nRecommendations\n\nFirst, let’s talk about who shouldn’t wear a belt.\n\nIf you have blood pressure problems or issues exacerbated by blood pressure elevations, you’d probably be better of not using a belt (or the valsalva technique at all, for that matter).\n\nIf you have issues exacerbated by spikes in intraabdominal pressure (like an inguinal hernia), you’re probably better off not using a belt.\n\nNext, who maybe shouldn’t wear a belt.\n\nThese are mainly athletes whose sport is not directly tied to how much weight they can lift.  Team sports athletes, track athletes (perhaps with the exception of throwers), etc.\n\nThe argument against belt usage is that you can’t wear a belt when competing, so you shouldn’t wear a belt when training so you learn how to effectively brace without a belt.\n\nThe counterargument is that bracing of the torso is highly pattern-specific.  You may not be able to brace effectively squatting or deadlifting beltless, but that really doesn’t have much bearing on how well you can brace to sprint or cut or perform any other sporting maneuvers.  If you’re having issues bracing effectively for your sport, then I’d recommend more work dedicated to practicing and training those specific bracing patterns, not a general one that may not have much carryover to your sport.\n\nNext, who should consider carefully what type of belt they get.\n\nThese are mainly weightlifters and “rotund” or short powerlifters.  For weightlifters, obviously you don’t want your belt inhibiting your range of motion, because the lowest man has an advantage.  For the sake of specificity, if you catch a clean deepest without a belt, I’d recommend front squatting without a belt.  If you can catch a clean equally deep with a skinny belt, then by all means squat and front squat with it too.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen a high-level weightlifter use a powerlifting-style belt even though the IWF rulebook actually allows a wider belt than is allowed in powerlifting (12cm vs. 10cm).  Who knows, you may be the exception who can catch a lift just as deep with a thick belt, though.\n\nFor portly and/or short powerlifters, it may be prudent to get a thinner belt as well, since it’s not uncommon for a thick belt to negatively impact your starting position for the deadlift.  Increased intraabdominal pressure doesn’t mean much if you’re starting the pull in a crappy position.\n\nFinally, who should almost certainly train with a belt.\n\nPowerlifters and bodybuilders.\n\nAll those benefits we talked about at the beginning of the article – moving more weight for the same number of reps, moving the same weight for more reps, or moving the same weight for the same reps while incurring less fatigue per set (allowing for more total volume) – you’d be a fool not to take advantage of them.  Unless you have a problem with exploiting the two most potent factors for long-term strength gains (volume and intensity)… and if so, that’s your issue.\n\nFurther Considerations\n\nSo, with that in mind, what are some circumstances where it may be beneficial to train beltless?\n\nThe main one that comes to mind is when your hips or knees are feeling beaten up (not the same thing as injured), but you still want to get a good workout in while giving them a break.  Training beltless naturally limits how much weight you can use, so it can be used to challenge yourself with decreased loading.\n\nAnother instance would be if there’s a very large discrepancy between your belted and beltless maxes (more than 10-15%).  This could indicate that you’re using a belt as a crutch, masking poor intrinsic stabilization.  In my experience, this is pretty rare and doesn’t take more than a few weeks to remedy.  Again, purely anecdotal, but these tend to be people who can lift a small house, but whose back and hips tend to feel “achy” (beyond the achiness that naturally comes with lifting small houses) except when they’re lifting.\n\nOne more thing worth noting – there may be a sex difference in the effects of lifting belts.  One study examined the effect of belts on oblique activation during occupational tasks (i.e. picking up and moving stuff – not lifting weights with a powerlifting-style belt) and noted a slight average decrease when wearing a belt.  However, external oblique activation actually increased in 5 out of the 6 men in the study, but decreased in all 14 women.  I’m not aware of any further studies investigating this difference specifically in a gym setting, so I wouldn’t worry about it too much, but it’s worth keeping in the back of your mind.\n\nClick to expand.\n\nWhen Should You Start?\n\nA common question that gets thrown around is “when should you start training with a belt?”\n\nSome people throw around numbers such as being about to squat and deadlift 315 or 405, or 1.5x bodyweight, or some other arbitrary standard.\n\nFor the life of me, I can’t figure out a good reason (physiologically) someone shouldn’t start using a belt whenever the hell they want to.  I do certainly agree that people should also get comfortable lifting and bracing without a belt.  Again, I’m not aware of any injury data regarding belt usage in strength sports, but it seems very likely that developing and maintaining solid intrinsic stabilization patterns under load will be a good thing for spine health in the long run.  However, “people should also get comfortable squatting and deadlifting beltless” and “people should never squat and deadlift with a belt until they achieve (insert arbitrary standard here)” are entirely different sentiments.  I’d recommend you spend your first month or two training mostly beltless, but remember, there’s a learning curve for belts – most people can’t get much aid out of them until they’ve been lifting with a belt for a while. It’s just another skill to acquire.  I’m not sure why you’d want to push that learning process back to some arbitrary later date and delay reaping the benefits that accompany training with a belt.\n\nPersonally, I’d recommend training 70/30 or 80/20 beltless your first few months in the gym, gradually transitioning to the opposite ratio as you become more experienced.\n\nHow to Use a Belt\n\nStep 1:  Setting the belt\n\nUsually people set the belt so it’s just on top of their iliac crest.  For squats, some people angle the belt up (going above the belly button), some people have it going straight across, and some people angle it down (below the belly button).  For deadlifts, it’s usually either straight across or angled up (so it doesn’t interfere with getting in a good starting position, as it may if it’s angled down).\n\nHonestly, this is more a matter of comfort than anything else.  Start with it in whatever position is most comfortable.  As you learn how to use it better, then you may want to play around with different heights and angles to see what allows you to get your torso the tightest.\n\nStep 2: Find the right tightness\n\nYou should use the tightest notch that still allows for a full intake of breath.  If you can’t get a full breath of air, or you have to elevate your shoulders to get a full breath instead of solely expanding your torso, it’s too tight.  If you can get a full breath on one notch, but you can still get a full breath on the next tightest notch, you’re probably better off with the tighter one (at least for squats.  Many people prefer one notch looser for deadlifting because it allows them to get in a better starting postion.).\n\nStep 3: Embrace the pain\n\nFor most people, especially when using a wide (10cm) belt, bruising is almost inevitable along the top of the iliac crest as the belt presses against it. This is especially true for short people.  Sometimes a fold of skin will get caught in it (especially if you’re on the portly side of things).  That’s no fun at all.  Using a belt, especially a 10cm leather belt that’s not broken in yet, can be uncomfortable.  Either deal with it or get a narrower belt.  Luckily, as your belt gets broken in better, it becomes much more comfortable and bruises you a lot less.  If you take good care of it, though, it’ll last you basically forever.\n\nWhat to Look for in a Powerlifting Belt\n\nThis part is pretty simple.  You’ll probably do best with a 10cm wide belt for squat.  If you can’t get in a good starting position for deadlift with a 10cm belt, then it may be worthwhile to invest in a belt that’s tapered in the front, or 6.35cm (2.5in) in width all the way around.  Belts come in different thicknesses as well, from 9mm to 13mm.  9mm belts tend to be a little more comfortable and break in faster, but thicker belts are a little more durable, though that’s not an overly important consideration because almost any belt you get will last you a few decades.\n\nBelts also come with either prongs or levers to latch them.  Levers have the advantage of being faster to put on and remove.  However, with a lever belt, you’re locked into one size and you need to use a screwdriver and take a few minutes re-adjusting your belt if the need arises, which can be inconvenient if you prefer different tightnesses for squat and deadlift, or if you engage in a little too much dietary hedonism one day and find yourself a notch more bloated than normal the next day.  If you go with a prong belt, for the love of god, get a single prong belt.  You may think double prong belts look cooler and more secure, but they are not more secure, and just getting one prong through one eyehole is a whole lot more convenient than getting two prongs through two eyeholes, especially if you like to cinch your belt tight.\n\nIn Closing\n\nGet a good belt and use it, as long you don’t have any conditions exacerbated by higher-than-normal spikes in IAP and blood pressure, or are a weightlifter for whom a belt doesn’t allow you to catch a lift as deep.\n\nAs long as you don’t fall into one of those two groups, you’ll probably benefit from training with a belt most of the time.\n\nAddendum, 2018\n\nWhen this article was published way back in 2015, I was skeptical of McGill’s argument that belt usage only increased performance secondary to spinal flexion.  However, I didn’t have any evidence to the contrary.  However, a recent study was published showing that, under lab conditions, increased intraabdominal pressure directly increases maximal hip extension torque.  Now, full disclosure, this study didn’t have people wear lifting belts to test hip extension torque.  However, the most direct effect of wearing a belt is a consistent, large increase in IAP, so this study suggests that the boost in performance you get from wearing a belt is likely due to your hip extensors simply being capable of contracting harder due to more IAP.\n\nShare this on Facebook and join in the conversation\n\nRelated Reading: \n\nShould You Wear A Belt Or Not?\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.backfitpro.com/pdf/weight_belts.pdf\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578435/\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140138708969676#preview\n\nhttp://trainology.org/PDF/7%20Isometric%20Strength%20of%20Powerlifters%20in%20Key%20Positions.%20Beckham%20et%20al.pdf\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11411626\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12930176\n\nhttps://javierbutragueno.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/a-review-of-the-use-of-lifting-belts.pdf\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11932579\n\nhttp://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1999/11000/The_Use_of_Lumbar_Supporting_Weight_Belts_While.14.aspx\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11710410\n\nhttp://www.setantacollege.com/wp-content/uploads/Journal_db/The%20effectiveness%20of%20weight%20belts%20during%20muliple%20repetitions%20of%20the%20squat%20exercise.pdf\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2709981\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10619094\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2304406\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17047531\n\nhttp://bjsm.bmj.com/content/25/4/209.abstract\n\nGreg Nuckols\nGreg Nuckols has over a decade of experience under the bar, a BS in Exercise and Sports Science, and a Master's in Exercise Physiology.

    "content": "The “Hypertrophy Rep Range” – Fact or Fiction?\nby Greg Nuckols\nArticles, Programming\nIs there a hypertrophy range of 6-15 reps per set that will net you more muscle growth? Let's look at this question both scientifically and practically.\nWhat you’re getting yourself into:\n\n3500 words, 12-25 minute read time\n\nMore information about the individual studies, adjustments, and analyses can be found in the article The “Hypertrophy Rep Range” – Stats and Adjustments if you want to dig a little deeper into this topic.\n\nKey Points\nWhen looking at the whole body of scientific literature, there’s simply not a very big difference in muscle growth when comparing different rep ranges.\nFrom a practical standpoint, you should probably do most of your training in the rep range that allows you to get in the most hard sets per training session and per week for each exercise you use and each muscle you train.  This generally coincides with a moderate intensity and rep range for most exercises and most people.\nSince different rep ranges go about triggering a growth response in slightly different ways, you’re probably better off training with a full spectrum of rep ranges instead of rigidly staying in a single rep range and intensity zone.\nIntroduction to the Hypertrophy Rep Range\n\nI’ve been training now for a decade.  In that time, I’ve seen a lot of ideas, fads, and trends come and go.  One standby, though, has been “rep ranges.”\n\nAt least as far back as the ’50s (and probably before), people have been promoting the idea that low reps were ideal for strength development, moderate reps (somewhere between 6-8 reps on the low end, and 12 to 15 on the high end) were best for building muscle, and high reps were best for building strength endurance.\n\nHow fanatical people were about those rep ranges varied, sure, but those have been the accepted ranges for a long, long time.  Some people take it to the extreme, and assume that any muscle growth outside of the “hypertrophy range” will be minimal or nonexistent.  Other people will assent to the idea that you can still grow a bit with low-rep or high-rep training, but that your results will still be notably better if you stick to the “hypertrophy range.”  Sure, you may be able to build a little muscle doing heavy sets of 3 or 20+ rep “pump sets,” but you’d grow more if you stayed in the hypertrophy range.\n\nNow, before jumping in, I will note that the assumptions about lower reps/higher weights building more strength and higher rep/lower weights building more strength endurance have largely been validated.  You can still gain strength with light weights/high reps and moderate weight/moderate reps, but strength gains are generally better with heavy, low-rep training.  Conversely, you can build absolute muscular endurance (how many times you can move a set load, regardless of your 1rm) with low rep and moderate rep training, but you can build a lot more with high rep training, and high rep training is generally the only way to improve relative muscular endurance (how many times you can lift a certain percentage of your 1rm).\n\nWhat I want to do in this article is examine that middle zone:  the “hypertrophy range.”  Is training in that general range the best way to build muscle?  Can you expect more muscle growth training in that range, and if so, just how big are the differences?\n\nSo, just to define terms before we get underway:\n\nWhen I talk about “heavy” or “low-rep” training, I’m generally talking about loads in excess of 85% of your 1rm, for sets of 5 reps or fewer.\nWhen I talk about “moderate weights,” “moderate reps,” or “the hypertrophy zone,” I’m generally talking about loads between 60-85% of your 1rm, for sets of 6-15 reps.\nWhen I talk about “light weights” or “high reps,” I’m generally talking about loads less than 60% of your 1rm, for sets of 15 reps or more.\nMechanistic Perspective\n\nLet’s ask ourselves the million-dollar question before diving in:  What the heck makes a muscle grow in the first place?\n\nFirst, we can look at it from a mechanistic perspective.\n\nThe two major mechanisms of hypertrophy in a constant tug of war are mechanical tension and metabolic stress.  More of one generally means less of the other.  When you add weight to the bar, you induce more tension – but you can’t do as many reps, so metabolic stress is lower.  When you take weight off the bar, you can cause more metabolic stress – but muscle tension is lower.  Looking at things from this very basic perspective, you’d expect training to be effective across a pretty broad range of parameters.\n\n(If you’re a savvy reader, you may want to check out this background information before reading this next section.  However, I know it would make some people’s eyes glaze over, so I made it a separate post.)\n\nIs there a hypertrophy range scientifically?\n\nMaybe, but the overall picture is murky, and any differences would be pretty small.\n\nComparison One:  The ‘Hypertrophy Range’ vs. Study Averages\n\nThese next two charts compare the average results of the groups training in the “hypertrophy range” of 6-15 reps per set to the average results of all the participants in the study.  Each positive data point means the average growth in the high- or low-rep group beat the average growth in the moderate rep group, and vice versa for negative data points.  All the studies included in this analysis are linked at the end of the article, and all adjustments made to the data in order to control for factors such as number of sets and rest intervals are explained here.\n\nStudies comparing low and moderate reps are on the left, and those comparing moderate and high reps are on the right.\n\nUsing adjusted values, there was effectively no difference in this comparison.  Low reps out-performed the study means by 1% on average compared to moderate reps, and moderate reps out-performed the study means by 1% on average compared to high reps.  As you can see, though, most of the studies cluster in the +/- 20% range.\n\nStudies comparing low and moderate reps are on the left, and those comparing moderate and high reps are on the right.\n\nUsing adjusted values, there were a few differences, but they were pretty small.  Low reps out-performed the study means by 7% on average compared to moderate reps, and moderate reps out-performed the study means by 8% on average compared to high reps.  As you can see, though, most of the studies still cluster in the +/- 20% range.\n\nComparison Two:  The “Hypertrophy Range” vs. High and Low Reps – Effect Sizes\n\nOf the 13 calculable effect sizes comparing low to moderate reps, three favored moderate reps, two favored low reps, and the other eight were ties (effect size differences <0.2).\n\nThe average effect size in the low rep measurements was 0.68, and the average effect size in the moderate rep measurements was 0.71.  These average effect sizes were not significantly different (p = 0.37)\n\nOf the 16 calculable effect sizes comparing high to moderate reps, nine favored moderate reps, three favored high reps, and the other four were ties (effect size differences <0.2).\n\nThe average effect size in the high rep measurements was 0.75, and the average effect size in the moderate rep measurements was 1.08.  There was a trend toward significance (p = 0.082).  However, this was strongly influenced by a single study discussed here.  Excluding that one study, the average effect size was 0.85 for high reps and 0.99 for moderate reps, and the trend toward significance disappears.\n\nComparison Three:  Percent Muscle Growth in Each Study\n\nI just want to point out (or reiterate, for people who read the supplementary material already) before starting this section:  This comparison is probably the least appropriate set because muscle growth was measured in different ways in different studies.  However, I think it’s worth discussing because it adds another layer of analysis and another set of comparisons some readers will be more familiar with.\n\nOf the nine studies or measurements comparing low reps (five or fewer reps per set, 85%+ 1rm) to moderate reps (6-15 reps per set, 60-85%1rm), three favored moderate reps, and three favored low reps, and there were three ties when looking at percent differences.\n\nOf the 14 studies or measurements comparing high reps (20 or more reps per set, <60% 1rm) to moderate reps (6-15 reps per set, 60-85%1rm), five favored moderate reps, and six favored high reps, and there were three ties when looking at percent differences.\n\nPooling all the studies together, low reps caused measures of muscle size to increase by 11.91±5.70% on average.  Before adjusting for differences in sets and rest periods, moderate reps in those same studies caused measures of muscle size to increase by 10.63% on average.  After adjustments, moderate reps caused a 12.19±6.58% increase.  Neither of those increases were significantly different from those caused by low reps. (The p = 0.32 for unadjusted, and p = 0.46 for adjusted values; one-tailed t-test.)\n\nPooling all the studies together, high reps caused measures of muscle size to increase by 9.17±5.10% on average.  Before adjusting for differences in sets and rest periods, moderate reps in those same studies caused measures of muscle size to increase by 12.00% on average.  After adjustments, moderate reps caused a 10.67±8.5% increase.  Neither of those increases were significantly different from those caused by high reps. (The p = 0.15 for unadjusted, and p = 0.32 for adjusted values; one-tailed t-test.)\n\nFinally, I looked to see if there was a correlation between reps per set and muscle growth.\n\nWhen comparing low reps to moderate reps, there’s no relationship whatsoever:  r = 0.062.  Due to the variety of ways to measure muscle growth used in these studies and differing lengths of the studies, you wouldn’t expect a super strong correlation.  However, 0.062 is about what you’d expect from a completely random data set.\n\nWhen comparing high reps to moderate reps, the correlation is effectively nonexistent as well:  r = -0.27.  Generally, a correlation of at least ±0.3 is required to classify something as even being a weak relationship.  Additionally, the r^2 value of 0.074 means that only about 7.4% of the differences in muscle growth can be explained by differences in rep range used.\n\n Here’s how we can basically sum up this section:\n\n \n\nIs there a hypertrophy rep range practically?\n\nIn all likelihood. But that doesn’t mean you should do all your training there.\n\nAt this point, it’s time to take the scientist hat off and put the lifter/coach hat back on.\n\nOn average, looking at both percent differences and effect sizes, the “hypertrophy range” did slightly better than either high reps or low reps.  However, there were also plenty of instances where low reps or high reps had a small edge.  Finally, keep in mind that this sort of aerial-view analysis is looking at the averages of the average results of a bunch of different studies.  The studies’ results didn’t conform to a nice, tidy pattern, and you can bet that the individual results within those studies didn’t conform to nice, tidy patterns either.\n\nSo, here’s what I’m personally taking away from this:\n\nThe “hypertrophy range” of roughly 6-15 reps per set may produce slightly better results per unit of time invested than low rep and high rep work.  However, on the whole, the advantage you get from working in the hypertrophy range isn’t nearly as big as people seem to think; maybe a ~10-15% advantage per unit of effort invested at most.\nYou can absolutely grow effectively when training with low reps and high reps.  In fact, mechanistic work has shown that although different rep ranges trigger similar elevations in protein synthesis, the signaling pathways activated to produce that growth response are actually somewhat different.  You’re probably missing out on some growth if you confine yourself to a single rep range, even the “hypertrophy range.”  My assumption is that individual signaling pathways would habituate to a single stimulus faster than multiple signaling pathways would habituate to slightly different stimuli.\nDue to the sheer amount of variability we’re looking at, both within studies and between studies, it’s probably not wise to assume that a single rep range will be the best for everyone.  Some people and some exercises just seem to do better with higher reps or lower reps.\n\nI think instead of asking yourself, “Is this rep range better than this other rep range in some objective physiological sense?” you’re better off asking yourself, “What allows me to get in the most high quality sets during each session and during each week?”\n\nLet’s unpack that statement a bit.\n\nHigh quality sets refer to those that employ exercises that are likely going to be limited by the muscle you’re trying to train, through the longest range of motion you can maintain with safe form, taken within 2-3 reps of failure*, and performed when you’re adequately recovered from your previous set (generally around 1.5-2 minutes of rest for isolation lifts, and 3-5+ minutes for heavy compound lifts).\n\n*Failure defined as absolute failure for exercises like curls or delt raises where injury risk is low, and technical failure for exercises like squats or deadlifts where injury risk is higher.\n\nMaximizing hard sets within a training session depends, in large part, on what you’re accustomed to and how you respond to each set.\n\nFor some people, heavy sets of 3-5 reps will – for lack of a better term – “burn out their CNS” (that’s a big topic not worth unpacking right now), meaning that after a couple of challenging sets, they just feel fried and the rest of their workout suffers.\n\nFor other people, sets of 12-15+ will just crush them metabolically, especially for exercises like squats and deadlifts, meaning they can’t get in much high quality work after a couple of hard sets.  Maximizing hard sets within a session is also why stopping 2-3 reps shy of failure – especially on heavy compound lifts – is generally a good idea; a set to failure generally takes more out of you than a set stopped a bit earlier and limits how much more quality work you can handle.\n\nMaximizing hard sets within a training week depends both on what you can best recover from between sessions and how you structure your training week.  Again, some people wind up with creaky joints if they lift too heavy, too often, and other people are left with crippling soreness when they train with higher reps (especially if they’re not used to them).\n\nStructuring the training week is another topic for another day, but the basics are simple: If you’re training a muscle or movement twice per week, then you should try to make sure those sessions are spaced out by at least 72 hours.  If you’re training a muscle or movement more than twice per week, make sure that you’re the most well-rested going into your hardest sessions, and intersperse harder sessions with easier ones so that you’re not accumulating too much fatigue.  If training one lift hard is going to interfere with another lift (for example, squats and deadlifts), either try to do them in the same session so that you have time to recover before doing them again, or try to put as much time as possible between your hardest session for one and your hardest session for the other.\n\nLooking at this question practically, I think this is where the “hypertrophy rep range” really comes from.\n\nIn the 6-15 rep range, the weights are generally manageable enough that you can maintain good technique, not cheat the range of motion, get pretty close to failure safely, not “burn out your CNS” after just a couple of sets, and not be left with creaky joints.  On the other hand, the weights are generally heavy enough that you’re still putting a fair amount of tension on the muscle, you’re more likely to be limited in each set by muscular fatigue than systemic anaerobic fatigue, and you’re not doing so many reps that you’re metabolically crushed after your first couple of sets.\n\nEssentially, I think people have gotten the cause and effect mixed up:  It’s not that there’s something magical about the “hypertrophy range” that makes it meaningfully better than other intensity ranges when other training variables are controlled for. It’s that simply being able to do more hard training tends to produce better results, and most people tend to be able to do the most hard training when they do the majority of their work in that intensity range.\n\nWith that in mind, your goal should be to find the rep range for each lift that allows you to get the most high-quality, hard work in.\n\nSpeaking purely anecdotally, here are my 100% bro-certified, entirely not-evidence-based observations about the rep ranges that tend to work best for several key lifts:\n\nSquats and deadlifts:\n\nSets of 3-8 for people with a strength sports background.  You’re probably strong enough that more than 8 reps gets too metabolically taxing.\nSets of 5-10 for newer lifters, or people with bodybuilding background.  It’s typically a bit lower for deadlifts than squats, because letting your technique slip as you fatigue is easier with deadlifts.\n\nRows:\n\nSets of 8-15.  People often make the mistake of going too heavy and turning rows into a hip hinging exercise more so than a lat exercise.  While I have my bro hat on, cheaty rows are a pretty effective accessory lift for improving your deadlift, but don’t tend to be a great lat builder.\n\nPull-ups/Chin-ups:\n\nSets of 5-10.  Pull-ups lend themselves to lower reps than rows because it’s harder to use momentum to cheat the movement.  Additionally, people tend to start compromising range of motion with higher reps.\n\nBarbell pressing of all sorts:\n\nSets of 5-10 tend to work best here.  Too heavy, too often tends to beat up people’s elbows and/or shoulders, and a lot of people find that higher rep sets seem to be limited more by their anterior deltoids than their pecs (bench or incline), lateral deltoids (overhead press), or triceps (all types of pressing).\n\nDumbbell pressing of all sorts:\n\nSets of 8-15 in general.  With weights that are too heavy, balance can become problematic, so you waste a lot of energy just controlling the weight instead of training the muscles you’re trying to train.\n\nUnilateral lower body work:\n\nSets of 8-15 in general.  Again, the weight needs to be light enough that you can work the target muscles and train the movement effectively instead of turning the exercise into a balancing act, but they also need to be heavy enough that metabolic fatigue within the set isn’t going to start making balance problematic toward the end of the set.\n\nAny sort of isolation lift or machine work:\n\nSets of 8+.  With isolation lifts, you don’t really have to worry about systemic metabolic fatigue, and going too heavy can irritate a lot of people’s tendons since generally you can work the individual muscle through a longer range of motion than you’d be able to with a compound lift.  Regarding machine work, low reps on machines just seems silly and anecdotally just doesn’t seem to work very well.\n\nKeep in mind, these are just general guidelines based on my own experiences and observations.  Start there, and experiment to see what lets you get in the most high-quality work.  Some people simply do better with higher or lower reps.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb: Aim to get 60-70% of your work sets in the rep range that you personally find works best for you, and get 15-20% of your sets with heavier weights/lower reps and about 15-20% of your work with lighter weights/higher reps.\n\nSo, if you’re doing 15 sets per week of exercises focused on a particular muscle, that would mean getting 9-10 of those sets within your personal “hypertrophy range,” along with 2-3 heavier, lower rep sets and 2-3 lighter, higher rep sets.\n\nFinally, to round out this section regarding practical application, keep in mind that this applies to hypertrophy training.  The game is a little bit different for maximizing strength development in the short term, though most strength athletes would benefit from focusing more on hypertrophy work during most of their training.\n\nIf you want to dig even deeper into this topic, read about the math and adjustments behind the graphs above, read a little bit about the individual studies that were included in this analysis, and see which studies were excluded with reasons for exclusion, you can do so here.  At this point, though I’m going to wrap things up for this article since this is the end of the stuff 80% of you will probably care about.\n\nQuick Note: If you’re interested in dialing in your nutrition, check out our app MacroFactor.

Al:  Neither Load Nor Systemic Hormones Resistance Training-Mediated Hypertrophy or Strength Gains is Resistance-Trained Young Men\n\nThe participants were young men with some strength training experience (at least 2 years required, with an average of 4 years).  The participants all performed four full-body training sessions per week for 12 weeks.  One group did 3 sets of 8-12 reps for all exercises, and one group did 3 sets of 20-25 reps for all exercises.  All sets were taken to failure.\n\nThere were no significant differences between groups in gains of fat- and bone-free mass, leg lean mass, appendicular lean mass, type I muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area.\n\nType 1 and Type 2 fiber growth after training with 30-50% of 1rm vs. 75-90% of 1rm. As you can see, the results for both fiber types were darn near identical for both loading zones. Source\n\nFor more on fiber type-specific hypertrophy, check out this article.\n\nThe second by Fink et. Al:  Impact of High Versus Low Fixed Loads and Non-Linear Training Loads on Muscle Hypertrophy, Strength, and Force Development\n\nThe participants here were untrained.  The training protocol involved three sets of unilateral preacher curls to failure, three times per week (not exactly how most of us train, but certainly controlling for a ton of variables to allow for a valid comparison).\n\nOne group trained with 80% 1rm for sets of 8-12, one group trained with 30% 1rm for sets of 30-40, and one group alternated between training with 80% and 30% for two weeks before switching back to the other intensity range.\n\nElbow flexor (biceps and brachialis) muscle thickness increased by basically the same amount in all three groups – 9.1±6.4% with sets of 8-12, 9.4±5.3% with sets of 30-40, and 8.8±7.9% for the group alternating between sets of 8-12 and sets of 30-40.\n\nThe third by Schoenfeld et. Al:  Effects of Varied Versus Constant Loading Zones on Muscular Adaptations in Trained Men\n\nThe participants had four years of training experience on average.  Half of them trained with sets of 8-12 reps for three sessions per week, while half of them trained with sets of 2-4 reps one day, sets of 8-12 one day, and sets of 20-30 one day.  Both groups did the same number of sets, and all sets were taken to failure.\n\nAt the end of the 8 weeks, growth was pretty comparable between the two groups.  Effect sizes slightly favored varied loading over constant loading for elbow flexor (biceps and triceps; .72 vs. .57) and triceps (.77 vs. .48) growth.  In terms of percentages, it was a 6.6% vs. 5% increase in cross-sectional area for the elbow flexors, and 6.4% vs. 4.2% for the triceps.  There wasn’t a meaningful difference in quad growth, however (effect size of 1.04 vs. 1.12, and a 7.6% vs. 8.6% in vastus lateralis cross-sectional area, slightly favoring constant loading).\n\nNone of these differences reached formal statistical significance.\n\nFrom Schoenfeld et. Al. Source\n\nThese three new studies largely confirm the previous analysis in the original version of this article.  All three equated volume based on number of sets to failure, and all three found very similar growth across a variety of rep ranges.  It’s interesting that Schoenfeld’s study found a slight benefit for changing loading zones, while Fink’s found that changing loading zones had essentially no effect (in fact, the group that changed loading zones got slightly worse results than the two groups that trained with either sets of 8-12 or sets of 30-40 consistently – the difference was nowhere close to significance).  The difference may have to do with how often the loading zones were varied: daily for Schoenfeld versus every two weeks for Fink.  That seems like an area in need of more research to tease out the details.\n\ntl;dr – in the past 7 months, three new studies have been published that very much fall in line with the bulk of the previous literature and the analysis in the original version of this article:  As long as sets are taken to failure or near failure, muscle growth is very similar between all rep and intensity ranges.  There is no “hypertrophy zone.”\n\nEdit: September 2017\n\nA recently-published meta-analysis by Brad Schoenfeld and colleagues analyzed hypertrophy after low-load (<60% of 1RM) and high-load (≥60% of 1RM) training.\n\nThe forest plot of results from the included studies is the real money shot here:\n\nThe confidence interval for all effects crosses zero, and the pooled effect was 0.03 – that may be the smallest pooled effect I’ve ever seen in a meta-analysis.  The “difference” was, of course, non-significant, and didn’t even approach the 0.20 cutoff conventionally used to identify a “small” effect.\n\nIn the context of this article, the vast majority of the studies in this meta compared what I’d consider low vs. moderate loads.  This is the absolute strongest evidence we have that hypertrophy is the same between moderate-load training (i.e. the “hypertrophy zone”) and low-load training.\n\nAddendum, May 2018\n\nA recent paper (reviewed in the latest issue of MASS) had some findings that provide some important new information in this area of research.  In most of the studies comparing high-load and low-load training, the low-load group uses a weight between 30-50% of 1RM.  There have been a couple studies using really low loads (15.5% is popular, for some reason), but those studies generally do a pretty bad job equating protocols.  Typically, the high-load groups in those studies are training to failure or close to failure, and the low load group just does a ton of sets, not particularly close to failure.  This recent study gives us the first “fair” comparison between higher-load training and really low-load training.\n\nIn this study, the subjects did unilateral training (biceps curls and knee extensions).  One arm and leg trained with 20% of 1RM, and one arm and leg trained with either 40%, 60%, or 80% of 1RM.  The subjects did their three sets with 20% first, going to failure on each set.  Then, they did sets to failure with 40%, 60%, or 80% until they’d equated volume load between their two limbs.  I’d have preferred if they just equated sets to failure with both limbs, but the number of sets performed ended up being similar enough that equating volume load was probably fine.\n\nAt the end of the study, biceps and quad hypertrophy was basically identical with 40%, 60%, and 80% of 1RM.  However, growth was halved with 20% of 1RM.\n\nThis lets us know that, while the “hypertrophy rep range” is way bigger than most people realize, there probably is a bottom end.  We have a lot of evidence showing similar per-set hypertrophy with loads ranging from 30% to ~85% of 1RM, but dipping down to 20% may just be too low to create adequate muscle tension to maximize growth.\n\nRunning List of (mostly) Newer Studies On this Topic:\n\nCrescent pyramid and drop-set systems

hypertrophy than higher or lower rep training physiologically.  When adjusting for factors like the number of sets performed and the rest periods between sets, it may be slightly better on average, but there’s a lot of variability.\nFrom a more practical perspective, the “hypertrophy rep range” is, in general, the intensity range that allows people to maximize how much hard work they can manage per workout and per week. However, looking at things from the reverse perspective (asking yourself how to maximize high quality sets per week), there is quite a bit of variability in optimal loading zone and rep range person-to-person and lift-to-lift.\nThere are probably benefits of utilizing rep ranges across the entire spectrum, so don’t neglect lower rep work and higher rep work in your training.\n\nShare this on Facebook and join in the conversation\n\nSources:\n\nEffects of Different Volume-Equated Resistance Training Loading Strategies on Muscular Adaptations in Well-Trained Men\n\nMuscular adaptations in response to three different resistance-training regimens:  specificity of repetition maximum training zones\n\nResistance Exercise Load Does Not Determine Training-Mediated Hypertrophic Gains in Young Men\n\nStrength training at high versus low external resistance in older adults: effects on muscle volume, muscle strength, and force-velocity characteristics\n\nEffects Of Low- Versus High-Load Resistance Training on Muscle Strength and Hypertrophy in Well-Trained Men\n\nGross Measures of Exercise-Induced Muscle Hypertrophy\n\nThe Effects of 4 and 10 Repetition Maximum Weight Training Protocols and Neuromuscular Adaptations in Untrained Men\n\nVolume-Equated High and Low Repetition Daily Undulating Programming Strategies Produce Similar Hypertrophy and Strength Adaptations\n\nMaintenance of Myoglobin Concentration in Human Skeletal Muscle After Heavy Resistance Training\n\nLow-Load Bench Press Training to Fatigue Results in Muscle Hypertrophy Similar to High-Load Bench Press Training\n\nNeuromuscular adaptations after 2- and 4-weeks of 80% versus 30% 1RM resistance training to failure\n\nHormonal Adaptation Determines the Increase in Muscle Mass and Strength During Low Intensity Strength Training Without Relaxation\n\nEarly Phase Muscular Adaptations In Response to Slow-Speed Versus Traditional Resistance Training Regimens\n\nHere are a few other studies on this topic, excluded for reasons explained here:\n\nMangine, Two by Tanimoto (one, two), Holm, Leger, Lamon, Alegre, and Kraemer\n\nGreg Nuckols\nGreg Nuckols has over a decade of experience under the bar, a BS in Exercise and Sports Science, and a Master's in Exercise Physiology.

    "title": "Training Frequency for Strength Development: What the Data Say",
    "content": "Training Frequency for Strength Development: What the Data Say\nby Greg Nuckols\nArticles, Programming\nThere's a lot of debate about the effects of training frequency for strength gains. However, the data are surprisingly clear.\n\nI have a reputation as a “high frequency guy.”  I’m not entirely sure that’s an accurate characterization of my actual training philosophies, but I can understand where it comes from.  The first thing I did that garnered any significant attention was my experiment with Bulgarian-style training (maxing on squat and bench every day, and often multiple times per day), and one of the first popular articles on this site was a guest post by Martijn Koevoets about the famous (or potentially infamous) Norwegian Frequency Project.  In reality, my own training frequency and my clients’ training frequencies have generally tended to be pretty typical, or maybe slightly on the high side of average (mainly for the bench press), but I’m far from a high frequency zealot.  I just thought frequency was an interesting variable to manipulate once people started paying more attention to it.  When I got into powerlifting, the general advice was that it was silly to ever exceed a frequency of twice per week for any lift, and squatting, benching, and deadlifting once per week was still very popular. So, when higher frequency systems started getting more popular, I thought they’d be fun to explore and write about.\n\nOne of the problems with discussing the effects of training frequency, however, was that there were a lot of anecdotes but very little research.  In terms of volume-matched research, there was an old study from McLester and colleagues comparing once-per-week training to thrice-per week-training, and some work by Häkkinen and Hartman comparing once-daily training to twice-daily training, but the literature was pretty sparse.  In 2012, the “Norwegian Frequency Project” came out and was greeted with a lot of fanfare due to the sparseness of the literature.  It found that, in a group of pretty well-trained powerlifters, training each lift six times per week led to larger strength gains than training each lift three times per week when volume was equated (i.e. the thrice per week group did twice as many sets on each of their training days).  For a long time, the debate about frequency centered on this study.  One group of people contended that we should start increasing frequency since this study was the best evidence we had on the effects of high training frequencies in trained lifters, while another group argued that we should ignore it, since it was only presented as a conference abstract and was never actually published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2017, a couple more studies were published, but volume-matched frequency studies were still pretty scarce.  A meta-regression on the relationship between frequency and strength gains by Grgic et al published in February 2018 (presumably submitted in late 2017) included just eight volume-matched studies, and one of them used peak torque as the strength measure (which doesn’t always agree with changes in dynamic strength), while another equated total volume load but not per-exercise volume.  However, since then, the frequency literature has entered a renaissance. Eight more volume-matched studies have looked at the effects of frequency on strength gains, and seven of them have used 1RMs as their strength measure.  So, just in the past few months, the pool of volume-matched frequency studies has doubled from 8 to 16, and the pool of frequency studies matching per-exercise volume and using 1RMs as their measure of strength has more than doubled from 6 to 13.\n\nSo, much like my recent articles on rep ranges and periodization, I want to move the conversation about training frequency beyond anecdote and beyond the fixation on a single study.  Strap in.  This is going to be a wild ride.\n\nIf you’re more interested in muscle growth than strength gains, I have an article about the effects of training frequency on muscle growth as well.\n\nTechnical Notes\n\nFeel free to skip this section if you trust me to not fuck things up too badly.\n\nI started by searching several databases to find all of the relevant studies, based on four criteria.\n\nThe study needed to examine the effects of training frequency with volume and intensity per exercise or muscle group matched.  The training intervention needed to last at least 6 weeks.\nThe study needed to report changes in dynamic, isoinertial strength (i.e. 1RMs, not torque or isometric force measures).\nThe subjects needed to be healthy and non-elderly (since age could conceivably affect the relationship between frequency and strength gains, as older people recover slower from training).\nThe study needed to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nFrom each study, I pulled all relevant info, including length of the training period, number of subjects, pre- and post-training strength, and pre-training standard deviations.  In studies that only reported single-joint strength measures (two papers looked at knee extensions), I included single-joint strength measures.  For studies that reported both single-joint and multi-joint strength measures, I only included multi-joint strength measures.  From there, I calculated effect sizes ((post – pre)/(pooled pre-training SD)) and percentage strength gains ((post – pre)/pre) for each strength measure in each study.  I also calculated percentage strength gains per week.\n\nI analyzed these studies several different ways.  I started with a mixed-effects meta-analysis of effect sizes (I found a way to do them in Excel.  Thank you Neyeloff et al.!) with frequency as a binary term (i.e. higher frequency vs. lower frequency), including all exercises from all studies. I also calculated the pooled average percent strength gains, pooled weekly percent strength gains, and difference between groups for all exercises in all studies as a more easily interpretable meta-analysis, since effect sizes can sometimes seem somewhat abstract.\n\nI made two tables for further analysis:  one table of the weekly percentage strength gains for each frequency in all studies, and one table of the difference in weekly percentage strength gains for each frequency.  In this second table, for example, a frequency of three per week was occasionally the high frequency condition, and occasionally the low frequency condition; this allows for comparisons between a given frequency and all other frequencies (both higher and lower) to see if there’s a frequency “sweet spot” or a range of frequencies that tends to perform best.\n\nAs a sub-analysis, I analyzed studies comparing frequencies of once or twice per week to frequencies of 3+ times per week, and studies comparing frequencies of 1-3x per week to 4+ times per week using weekly percent strength gains.  As further sub-analyses, I analyzed frequency as a binary term using percentage weekly strength gains in studies on trained lifters, studies on untrained lifters, measures of pressing strength, and measures of quad-dominant compound lower body strength.\n\nResults\n\nThirteen studies with a total of 328 subjects met the inclusion criteria, allowing for 31 comparisons.  The average study was 8 weeks long (range: 6-12), with 10.9 subjects per training group (range: 9-20).  Five studies used untrained subjects, and eight used subjects with at least some prior training experience.\n\nAuthor (Year)\tYear\tTitle\tTraining Status\t\nFrequencies compared\n\nBarcelos (2018)\t2018\tHigh-frequency resistance training does not promote greater muscular adaptations compared to low frequencies in young untrained men\tuntrained\t2 vs. 3 vs. 5\nZaroni (2018)\t2018\tHigh Resistance-Training Frequency Enhances Muscle Thickness in Resistance-Trained Men\ttrained\t1 vs. 5\nOchi (2018)\t2018\tHigher Training Frequency Is Important for Gaining Muscular Strength Under Volume-Matched Training\tuntrained\t1 vs. 3\nHunter (1985)\t1985\tResearch: Changes in body composition, body build and performance associated with different weight training frequencies in males and females\tuntrained\t3 vs. 4\nMcLester (2000)\t2000\tComparison of 1 Day and 3 Days Per Week of Equal-Volume Resistance Training in Experienced Subjects\ttrained\t1 vs. 3\nSchoenfeld (2015)\t2015\tInfluence of Resistance Training Frequency on Muscular Adaptations in Well-Trained Men\ttrained\t1 vs. 3\nThomas (2016)\t2016\tIncreasing Lean Mass and Strength: A Comparison of High Frequency Strength Training to Lower Frequency Strength Training\ttrained\t1 vs. 3\nYue (2018)\t2018\tComparison of 2 weekly-equalized volume resistance-training routines using different frequencies on body composition and performance in trained males.\ttrained\t2 vs. 4\nColquhoun (2018)\t2018\tTraining Volume, Not Frequency, Indicative of Maximal Strength Adaptations to Resistance Training.\ttrained\t3 vs. 6\nGomes (2018)\t2018\tHigh-frequency resistance training is not more effective than low-frequency resistance training in increasing muscle mass and strength in well-trained men\ttrained\t1 vs. 5\nBrigatto (2018)\t2018\tEffect of Resistance Training Frequency on Neuromuscular Performance and Muscle Morphology after Eight Weeks in Trained Men\ttrained\t1 vs. 2\nCandow (2007)\t2007\tEffect Of Short-Term Equal-Volume Resistance Training With Different Workout Frequency on Muscle Mass and Strength in Untrained Men and Women\tuntrained\t2 vs. 3\nArazi (2011)\t2011\tEffects of 8 Weeks Equal-Volume Resistance Training with Different Workout Frequency on Maximal Strength, Endurance and Body Composition\tuntrained\t1 vs. 2\n\nThe random effects meta-analysis found that higher training frequencies were associated with larger strength gains, though the overall effect was small (d=0.265; CI=0.08-0.45).  This was a significant difference (p=0.0088).  Upon visual inspection, there were two exceptionally large between-group effect sizes.  I tested whether they were unduly affecting the results.  After removing them, the effect size decreased nominally but would still be classified as a small effect (d=0.248; CI=0.14-0.36), and the p-value actually decreased as well, since the confidence interval shrunk (p=0.0001).\n\nEffect size and 95% CI for each comparison in each study.

The red diamond is the standardized mean difference and 95% CI after removing the two apparent outliers.\n\nOn average, subjects in the lower frequency groups got 14.65% stronger (CI=11.47-17.83%), while subjects in the higher frequency groups got 18.04% stronger (CI=14.34-21.73%).  The average difference in strength gains between groups was 3.39% (CI=1.39-5.39%), meaning the higher frequency groups gained about 23% more strength than the lower frequency groups, on average (i.e. 18.04% is 23% greater than 14.65%).  This would be classified as a small effect (d=0.35; CI=0.14-0.55), and the difference was significant (p=0.0024).\n\nOn average, subjects in the lower frequency groups got 1.91% stronger per week (CI=1.53-2.29%), while subjects in the higher frequency groups got 2.32% stronger per week (CI=1.89-2.75%).  The average difference in weekly strength gains between groups was 0.41% (CI=0.18-0.64%), meaning the higher frequency groups gained strength about 21% faster than the lower frequency groups, on average.  This would be classified as a small effect (d=0.36; CI=0.16-0.56), and the difference was significant (p=0.0018).\n\nFor this graph and all the rest like it, each comparison is a single point. The x-axis is weekly strength gains in the low frequency group, and the y-axis is weekly strength gains in the high frequency group. The red line is just y=x, so if a point falls directly on the red line, the two groups made identical strength gains. The black lines are ±10%, which is the trivial difference. A point above the black lines represents a comparison where the high frequency group gained more strength, while a point below the black lines represents a comparison where the low frequency group gained more strength.\n\nOn average, untrained subjects in the lower frequency groups (12 exercises across 5 studies) got 2.50% stronger per week (CI=1.79-3.20%), while untrained subjects in the higher frequency groups got 3.07% stronger per week (CI=2.27-3.87%).  The average difference in weekly strength gains between groups was 0.57% (CI=0.17-0.98%), meaning the higher frequency groups gained strength about 23% faster than the lower frequency groups, on average.  This would be classified as a small effect (d=0.43; CI=0.13-0.73), and the difference was significant (p=0.02).\n\nOn average, trained subjects in the lower frequency groups (19 exercises across 8 studies) got 1.49% stronger per week (CI=1.18-1.80%), while trained subjects in the higher frequency groups got 1.78% stronger per week (CI=1.47-2.09%).  The average difference in weekly strength gains between groups was 0.29% (CI=0.02-0.56%), meaning the higher frequency groups gained strength about 20% faster than the lower frequency groups, on average.  This would be classified as a small effect (d=0.42; CI=0.03-0.81), and the difference was significant (p=0.046).\n\nWhen simply looking at the mean weekly strength gains with each frequency, it appears that a frequency of 3x per week is best.  Average weekly strength gains were 1.47% with a once-per-week frequency, 2.17% with a twice-per-week frequency, 2.61% with a thrice-per-week frequency, and 2.10% with a frequency of 4+ times per week.  The only significant difference was between a frequency of once per week (CI=1.05-1.89% per week) and thrice per week (CI=1.99-3.23% per week), but the overall trend seems to suggest that a thrice-per-week frequency is best.\n\nMean and 95% CI for weekly strength gains with each frequency. Note: this is a common approach to analyzing data like this, but I feel it’s incorrect.\n\nHowever, direct comparisons tell a different story.  When a frequency of once per week (N=20 comparisons from 9 studies) was directly compared to other frequencies, it underperformed in direct comparisons by 0.366% per week.  A frequency of twice per week (N=13 comparisons from 6 studies) underperformed very slightly in direct comparisons, by 0.082% per week.  A frequency of three times per week (N=16 comparisons from 8 studies) overperformed in direct comparisons by 0.202% per week.  Frequencies of four (N=4 from 2 studies) and five (N=7 from 3 studies) times per week overperformed in direct comparisons by 0.495% and 0.439% per week, respectively.  A frequency of six times per week only slightly overperformed in direct comparisons (0.053% per week), but there were only two comparisons from one study to draw on.  This analysis makes it look like a frequency of 4-5 times per week is best.  However, a drawback is that few studies looked at frequencies exceeding three times per week.  To account for this fact, we can pool the results of studies using frequencies of 4+ times per week (N=13 comparisons from 6 studies), finding that frequencies of 4+ times per week overperformed in direct comparisons by 0.397% per week.  Higher frequencies were associated with larger strength gains (r=0.39).\n\nYou may be wondering why the results of the last two analyses differ.  Here’s a simple illustration.  Imagine you have three studies.  One compares a frequency of once per week to a frequency of four times per week, the second compares a frequency of three times per week to a frequency of four times per week, and the third compares a frequency of once per week to a frequency of three times per week.  In the first study, the low frequency group (1x) gets 5% stronger and the high frequency group (4x) gets 10% stronger.  In the second study, the low frequency group (3x) gets 10% stronger and the high frequency group (4x) gets 15% stronger.  In the third study, the low frequency group (1x) gets 20% stronger, while the high frequency group (3x) gets 25% stronger.  Just averaging the strength gains, you see a 12.5% increase with once per week [(5%+20%)/2], a 17.5% increase with three times per week[(10%+25%)/2], and a 12.5% increase [(10%+15%)/2] with four times per week.  It looks like 1x per week and 4x per week lead to similar gains, while 3x per week leads to the largest gains; however, those conclusions are driven by differences between studies, not differences between frequencies.  With direct comparisons, on the other hand, 1x underperforms both 3x and 4x by 5%, 3x overperforms 1x by 5% and underperforms 4x by 5% (average 0%), and 4x overperforms both 1x and 3x by 5%.  This more accurately represents the results in this imaginary trio of studies, because it does a better job accounting for the variability of results between studies.\n\nWith this in mind, I looked at studies comparing frequencies of 1-2x per week versus 3+ times per week (N=20 comparisons from 10 studies), since frequencies of once and twice per week underperformed in direct comparisons, while frequencies of 3+ times per week overperformed.  Frequencies of once or twice per week led to strength gains of 1.94% per week, on average (CI=1.41-2.47%), while frequencies of 3+ times per week led to strength gains of 2.37% per week, on average (CI=1.82-2.92%). The average difference in weekly strength gains between groups was 0.43% (CI=0.12-0.74%), meaning the higher frequency groups gained strength about 22% faster than the lower frequency groups, on average.  This would be classified as a medium effect (d=0.60; CI=0.16-1.04), and the difference was significant (p=0.014).\n\nFinally, I wanted to see if the effects of frequency depended on the type of movement being trained.  There were 11 comparisons in 10 studies for quad-dominant, compound lower body exercises (squat, leg press, and hack squat), and 13 comparisons in 11 studies for upper body pressing exercises (bench press or machine chest press).\n\nFor lower body exercises, frequencies of once or twice per week led to strength gains of 1.92% per week, on average (CI=1.24-2.61%), while frequencies of 3+ times per week led to strength gains of 2.19% per week, on average (CI=1.52-2.85%). The average difference in weekly strength gains between groups was 0.26% (CI=-0.18-0.70%), meaning the higher frequency groups gained strength about 14% faster than the lower frequency groups, on average.  This would be classified as a small effect (d=0.35; CI=-0.24-0.94).  This was not a significant difference (p=0.27).\n\nAs you can see, there’s not a clear pattern of either high or low frequency outperforming.\n\nFor upper body exercises, frequencies of once or twice per week led to strength gains of 1.52% per week, on average (CI=1.09-1.96%), while frequencies of 3+ times per week led to strength gains of 2.16% per week, on average (CI=1.46-2.87%). The average difference in weekly strength gains between groups was 0.64% (CI=0.27-1.01%), meaning the higher frequency groups gained strength about 42% faster than the lower frequency groups, on average.  This would be classified as a large effect (d=0.93; CI=0.39-1.47), and the difference was significant (p=0.0056).\n\nHere, there’s a very clear pattern of higher frequencies outperforming.\n\nGetting even more granular, we can analyze the frequency/strength gains slopes in each study to estimate the additional strength gains you could expect by increasing your frequency by one additional day per week.  For example, if group 1 trains with a frequency of once per week and increases strength by 10%, while group 2 trains with a frequency of thrice per week and increases strength by 20%, the slope would be (20%-10%)/(3-1)=5% per additional training day.  Since we see a roughly linear relationship between weekly strength gains and frequency from 1 to 4+ times per week, I feel pretty confident that this sort of analysis would hold up to frequencies of at least 4 or possibly 5 times per week, but I wouldn’t feel confident extrapolating it to six or seven days per week.  Since we see clear differences between pressing exercises and compound, quad-dominant lower body exercises, I’ll just focus on them here.\n\nFor upper body exercises, each additional day of frequency increased weekly strength gains by 0.51% (CI=0.14-0.88%).  The average upper body weekly strength gains across all frequencies in all studies was 1.84%, meaning each additional day of training frequency increased rate of strength gains by 28%, on average (CI=8-48%).  This slope was significantly different from zero (p=0.019).\n\nEach blue line represents the slope of the frequency/gains relationship in one study. The red line is the average slope, while the black lines are the top and bottom of the 95% confidence interval.\n\nFor lower body exercises, each additional day of frequency increased weekly strength gains by 0.10% (CI=-0.10-0.31%).  The average lower body weekly strength gains across all frequencies in all studies was 2.05%, meaning each additional day of training frequency increased rate of strength gains by 5%, on average (CI=-5-15%).  This slope was not significantly different from zero (p=0.33).\n\nDiscussion\n\nEven when volume is matched, it seems that higher training frequencies lead to larger strength gains.  Especially for upper body pressing exercises, spreading a given number of sets over more training days (up to at least 4) seems to increase strength gains.\n\nAcross most analyses, higher frequencies seem to lead to 20-23% faster strength gains, in both trained and untrained lifters, and there seems to be a fairly linear increase in the benefits of increased frequency, with 1<2<3<4+.  However, we don’t have enough studies with frequencies exceeding 4x per week to provide much granularity past that point.  Of note, it doesn’t seem that frequency significantly affects lower body strength gains, while it does significantly affect upper body strength gains.  Overall, I’m quite confident in these results, as the confidence intervals typically aren’t particularly close to zero, and the p-values for most comparisons are quite low (0.046 for trained lifters, but ≤0.02 for all other other comparisons).\n\nThis may surprise some readers, because many of the individual studies didn’t find significant differences between frequencies.  However, I think the protein literature provides us with an apt comparison here.  The majority of studies comparing different protein intakes don’t find significant differences in muscle or strength gains, but meta-analyses consistently show that eating more protein (up to ~1.6-2.2g/kg, or ~0.73-1g/lb) tends to be better.  Most of the individual studies in both bodies of literature fail to find significant differences due to low statistical power, but the hefty majority of the results lean in one direction, making the difference clear when results are pooled.  Of the 31 comparisons, the higher frequency group made >10% larger gains than the low frequency group 15 times, both groups made roughly similar gains (within 10% of each other) 14 times, and the low frequency group only made >10% larger gains than the high frequency group twice.  For upper body pressing, the consistency is even greater.  Of the 13 comparisons, the higher frequency group made >10% larger gains than the low frequency group 9 times, both groups made roughly similar gains 4 times, and the low frequency group never made gains >10% larger than the high frequency group.\n\nWith any analysis, however, it’s important to make sure the results aren’t influenced by outlier results.  For upper body pressing specifically, there were three relative differences that were quite large: female bench press in Hunter, bench press in McLester et al., and bench press in Candow and Burke.  In all three of these studies, the higher frequency group outpaced the lower frequency group by more than 1% per week.  However, when removing the results from these three studies, the effect size actually increases from 0.93 to 1.18, and the p-value decreases slightly.  The results of the other studies were so consistently in favor of higher frequencies for pressing, that three unusually positive results depressed the effect size by increasing the standard deviation!  So, that finding (which I consider the most important overall) seems quite robust.  For all other analyses, the overall effect was very consistent (20-23% larger strength gains with higher frequency), even when using different frequency thresholds and when examining both trained and untrained lifters independently, which makes me feel pretty confident that we’re seeing a true and reliable effect.\n\nThe biggest drawback of this analysis was that defining frequency was somewhat subjective.  Some studies used the same exercises in every training session, which made defining frequency straightforward.  However, other studies used per-muscle group frequency rather than per-exercise frequency, so in a study with bench press as a primary strength outcome, one group may have done bench press on day 1, incline on day 2, and machine chest press on day 3, while another group did all three of those exercises on the same day.  Bench press frequency was just once per week in both groups, but there was a difference in how frequently the pressing muscles were trained.  In situations like this, I counted it as a frequency difference of 3x per week versus once per week.  I made this decision based on this paper looking at the effects of exercise variation (it found that performing a main lift, plus biomechanically similar exercises, may lead to larger strength gains than just performing the main lift for more volume), but note that the results may not be perfectly reflective of “real-world” training, since most people would increase frequency of the bench press, specifically, when they increase pressing frequency.\n\nAnother drawback, similar to the periodization review, is that the “trained” lifters still weren’t super well-trained, so we can’t know how well these results would generalize to people who aren’t beginner or intermediate-level lifters.\n\nOn the topic of applying these results to real-world training, I think that, if anything, this analysis may underestimate the effects of training frequency.  In all of these studies, volume was controlled.  However, in the real world, increased training frequency is often used as a tool to increase volume.  For example, 10 hard sets of squats in a workout is going to make for a brutal workout, and that may be all of the squatting volume you can handle if you just train the squat once per week.  However, four hard sets of squats, three times per week is probably going to be very doable, even though weekly volume is higher.  Five hard sets, three times per week may be just as challenging as 10 sets in a single session, but it represents a 50% increase in weekly training volume.  So, it seems that higher frequency independently promotes larger strength gains, and it seems likely that the benefits of higher frequencies and higher volumes would be additive.  The recent Grgic meta-analysis supports this idea.  In analyses where volume wasn’t controlled, higher frequencies were strongly associated with larger strength gains.\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of training volume, I think it would be helpful to contextualize the overall effect of frequency.  Boosting strength gains by ~20% with higher training frequencies may not sound like much (that would be the difference between adding 30 pounds to your total instead of 25), but it’s actually on par with the effect of volume.  A recent meta-analysis by Ralston et al found that higher weekly set volumes (5+ sets per exercise, per week) led to ~20% larger strength gains than lower weekly set volumes (<5 sets per exercise, per week).  Overall, neither volume nor frequency make a night-and-day difference for strength gains (intensity seems to be the biggest driver), but they both seem to have similar, positive effects.\n\nOne interesting finding was that frequency seems to affect upper body strength gains (specifically for pressing exercises), but not lower body strength gains.  Initially, I thought this may be related to differences in training status, as in my periodization review.  In that review, periodization seemed to affect upper body strength gains more than lower body strength gains, and lower body strength gains were substantially larger than upper body strength gains (potentially indicating the subjects had more prior experience with hard upper body training than hard lower body training).  However, lower body strength gains were quite similar to upper body strength gains in this review (2.05% per week for lower body, and 1.84% per week for upper body), and the overall effect sizes were almost identical for trained and untrained lifters.  So, I don’t think differences in training experience with upper versus lower body exercises are a likely explanation.  It may instead be that upper body muscles recover faster between training sessions, facilitating higher training frequencies.  Anecdotally, I find that to be the case.\n\nMany frequency skeptics will posit that studies showing benefits of higher frequencies are really just picking up the effects of novelty.  Especially for bodybuilders, low frequencies are still the norm, so maybe people just make larger strength gains when you put them on a program they’re unaccustomed to.  However, the relative advantage of higher frequencies actually tended to either be the same or a bit larger in longer studies (the trend had a small positive slope, but the r value was just 0.23, and the correlation wasn’t significant).  Since none of the studies in this review ran longer than 12 weeks, we don’t have evidence about truly long-term effects of different training frequencies, but this does at least suggest that the advantage isn’t driven by novelty.  On the contrary, it may be that more evenly dispersing training stress across a week matters less for short-term training, with benefits accruing over longer periods of time as loads increase and fatigue builds.\n\nSo, the question becomes:  why do higher frequencies lead to larger strength gains, even when controlling for volume and intensity?\n\nThe first potential explanation that may come to mind would be hypertrophy.  However, the effects of frequency on hypertrophy are somewhat inconclusive.  A 2016 meta-analysis by Schoenfeld et al found that training frequencies of at least twice per week led to more hypertrophy than frequencies of just once per week, but the current literature doesn’t let us know, with any degree of reasonable certainty, whether even higher frequencies are even better for hypertrophy.  So, I feel pretty confident saying that less hypertrophy may partially explain the underperformance of once per week frequencies, but I wouldn’t feel confident saying that increased hypertrophy was able to explain the progressive outperformance of progressively higher frequencies (i.e. I wouldn’t feel confident saying that we should expect a hypertrophy difference when comparing 2x per week to 4x per week frequencies).\n\nAnother potential explanation is that higher frequencies still allow for higher total volumes, even if work set volume is still the same.  With higher frequencies, you still have to warm-up for every session, and while warm-up sets are easy, it’s not like your last couple of warm-up sets impose literally zero training stress.\n\nAnother potential explanation is superior skill acquisition and motor learning.  In general, you learn and master skills faster when you practice them more frequently.  However, I’m not sure how well this explains the results in this particular set of studies because a) if you posit that motor learning explains the differences, you’d expect larger benefits in untrained lifters (who are further from mastering the motor skills being tested), and that’s not what we see, and b) if you’ll remember, in many of these studies, per-muscle frequencies differed, but per-exercise frequencies didn’t.  Thus, more frequent practice may play a role (and intuitively, I feel like more frequent practice is an important factor), but I wouldn’t want to lean on it as the primary explanation.\n\nFinally, I think increased frequencies likely improve average training quality.  If you have to do three sets of squats in a session, all three sets will probably be pretty good sets.  If you do that two more times in a week, you’ve accumulated nine high-quality sets.  However, if you did all nine sets in a single training session, the quality of those sets would probably start decreasing well before you finished your ninth set.  If you want to use a more concrete concept than “quality,” average bar speed will probably be higher with fewer sets per muscle group, per workout.  If you move the same load at a faster speed, force output per rep is higher, thus increasing specificity and overall training stress.\n\nIf you put a gun to my head and forced me to say which of these factors matters the most, I’d speculate that higher average training quality is the most important, followed by skill acquisition, hypertrophy, and volume from warm-up sets (in that order).\n\nPractical Recommendations for Training Frequency\n\nAt this point, I want to make sure everyone pauses for a moment of clarity before people go out into the world and claim that you should train bench three times per day to maximize strength gains.  These studies all lasted 12 weeks or fewer; we tend to assume that things that provide larger gains in the short term will also provide larger gains in the long-term, but we can’t know that for sure.  Also, this is science, and science mostly deals with averages.  These findings may or may not apply to you as an individual.  Plenty of people have gotten super strong with low training frequencies, after all.  If your shoulder starts bothering you when you bench three or more times per week, don’t force yourself to grind through the pain because science(tm) says higher pressing frequencies are optimal(c).  On the flip side, if you find that you respond really well to squatting four times per week, don’t dial back the frequency because this analysis found that frequency didn’t matter as much for squats on average.\n\nWith those two big caveats in mind, I think the major takeaway is that higher frequencies (up to at least 4-5x per week) seem to lead to larger strength gains for upper body pressing exercises, on average, in both trained and untrained lifters, even when volume and intensity are equated.  On the other hand, strength gains for squat-type movements seem to be less affected by frequency.  If anything, I think this analysis may understate the effects of frequency in the “real world,” because volume was equated in all of these studies, although higher frequencies naturally allow for higher volumes in a real-world scenario.  I wouldn’t profess to know why, mechanistically, higher frequencies lead to larger strength gains (and why there’s a difference for upper body but not lower body), but I think average training quality and skill acquisition are probably the two biggest contributors, while the effects of hypertrophy play a smaller (or perhaps nonexistent) role once you get beyond a frequency of just once per week.\n\nIf you decide to increase your training frequency for a particular lift, I’d strongly recommend dialing back your per-session volume until you adjust (keeping your weekly volume unchanged).  I’d also recommend making one of your additional sessions an “easy” session where you stick with lighter loads than you’d normally use, and stay at least 3-4 reps from failure.  Once you see how well you’re recovering between sessions, you’ll know when you’re ready to start ramping up per-session volume.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you should consider signing up for Monthly Applications in Strength Sport.  It’s a research review that Eric Helms, Mike Zourdos, and I publish every month, breaking down the recent research that’s most relevant and useful for strength and physique athletes and coaches.  You can snag a free issue here if you’d like to check it out.\n\nEdit/Correction\n\nI realized I shouldn’t have included the Barcelos study (it wasn’t volume-matched).  I also realized the couple of exceptional large between-group effect sizes were due to studies reporting standard errors instead of standard deviations.  Those issues don’t affect the finding I consider to be most important (the large, positive effect on upper body pressing exercises).  Furthermore, removing the Barcelos study and fixing the effect sizes affected by the SD/SEM issue didn’t materially affect the result from the random effects meta-analysis (d=0.265 before; d=0.211 now).  The positive trend for increased strength gains with increased frequencies is still there (1x still underperforms by 0.366% per week, 2x now slightly overperforms by 0.004% per week, 3x still overperforms by 0.202% per week, and 4+ now overperforms by 0.405% per week).  None of the results of any of the other analyses materially changed either (everything is still statistically significant, the percent differences are all basically the same, none of the effect sizes are materially different, etc.).   When a few more frequency studies are published, I’ll give this article a full update and change all of the graphics to remove the Barcelos results and update the forest plot.  For the time being, however, I’m just leaving it as-is, since it would take a ton of time to re-do all of the graphics, and ultimately, the overall picture and the takeaways are completely unaffected.  I apologize for these oversights upon initial publication.\n\n \n\nShare this on Facebook and join in the

    "content": "Periodization: What the Data Say\nby Greg Nuckols\nArticles, Programming\nBefore discussing periodization, you should have a thorough understanding of what the research says. In this article, we provide a comprehensive, quantitative overview of the periodization research.\n\nFrom the outset, I want to make my intentions clear:  I want this to be the most thorough quantitative overview of the periodization literature in existence, while also being readily accessible and understandable.  It may get a bit dense and technical at times, but my aim is for anyone to be able to understand it, regardless of academic background, as long as they’re willing to read closely and pay attention.\n\nPeriodization is a popular topic of discussion in the strength community.  However, 90% of the discussion essentially boils down to “I read an article on (insert random website here) saying that xyz form of periodization is the best,” or “here are two studies that support my view, therefore I’m right,” or “well, in theory, xyz periodization model SHOULD lead to abc outcomes, therefore it’s indisputably the best.”  However, there’s a vast body of literature on the subject, with at least 60 studies (that I could find, at least), most of which the majority of people are completely unaware.  With this article, I basically want to provide the groundwork for people to discuss this topic well, with an empirical starting point and a beefy list of sources to read and learn from.\n\nIf you haven’t read the first installment in this series yet (Periodization: History and Theory), I’d encourage you to check it out before diving in here.\n\nBefore we get rolling here, since this article is a doozy, I want to tell you what you should expect from this article, in order:\n\nBasic definitions, just to ensure everyone’s on the same page.\nNotes about the quantitative analyses I performed.\nThe results of the analyses.\nProblems with the current research we have, and how it could be improved upon.\nPractical takeaways.\nLinks to sources and further reading.\n\n \n\nDefinitions\n\nTo start with, I need to make sure we’re all on the same page regarding terminology so you’ll know what the heck I’m talking about for the rest of this article.\n\nPeriodization\n\nThe National Strength and Conditioning Association’s definition of periodization is as follows: “Periodization is a method for employing sequential or phasic alterations in the workload, training focus, and training tasks contained within the microcycle, mesocycle, and annual training plan. The approach depends on the goals established for the specified training period. A periodized training plan that is properly designed provides a framework for appropriately sequencing training so that training tasks, content, and workloads are varied at a multitude of levels in a logical, phasic pattern in order to ensure the development of specific physiological and performance outcomes at predetermined time points.”\n\nThe three main pieces of the definition to pull out are:  sequential/phasic (training split up into distinct blocks that build on each other), variety (i.e. all of your training isn’t exactly the same), and goal-oriented (attaining peak performance at a specific time point – generally a competition).\n\nLinear Periodization (LP)\n\nLinear Periodization (often called “traditional periodization”) refers to the system developed by Matveyev and his comrades in the ‘50s and ‘60s in the Soviet Union, whereby training volume progressively decreases over time, and training intensity progressively increases over time, with a taper before a major competition.  Importantly, a “training cycle” in this model typically referred to at least an entire year of training (i.e. one world championship until the next world championship) and sometimes four years of training (i.e. one Olympics until the next Olympics).\n\nIn more recent times, the definition has shifted to some degree.  Now, when most people talk about linear periodization, they’re talking about any training structure in which volume generally decreases and intensity generally increases over time.  Unlike the original definition, that could refer to a few months of training, instead of a year of training or more.\n\nUndulating Periodization (UP)\n\nUndulating periodization refers to training structures in which volume and intensity both go up and down repeatedly over time.  Undulating periodization didn’t really get introduced as a concept until the definition of linear periodization changed to include shorter time periods.  When linear periodization still dealt with yearlong training organization, of course you’d have fluctuations in volume and intensity within that year.\n\nThe two major subcategories of undulating periodization are weekly undulating periodization (WUP) and daily undulating periodization (DUP).  With weekly undulating periodization, the fluctuations in volume and intensity take place week to week (generally with higher intensities corresponding with lower volumes, and vice versa).  For example, if a linear approach had you lifting 70% 1RM on week 1, 75% on week 2, 80% on week 3, and 85% on week 4, a weekly undulating approach may have you lifting 70% on week 1, 80% on week 2, 75% on week 3, and 85% on week 4 (intensity goes up, down, up in this example, instead of just increasing every week).\n\nWith daily undulating periodization, the fluctuations in volume and intensity take place within a single training week.  For example, if your training intensity on week one is supposed to be 75% and you squat twice in that training week, without DUP, you’d use 75% loads for both sessions; with DUP, you may use 70% for one session and 80% for your other session.1periodization).  For daily undulating periodization, you could just define each workout as its own microcycle, and for weekly undulating periodization, you could just define each week as its own mesocycle, but those delinations can be a bit of a stretch, especially in the case of powerlifting where the fluctuations in intensity and overall training goal generally aren’t that large.  However, daily/weekly undulating periodization is the terminology typically used in the literature, so that’s what we’re going with here.\n\n\n\nBlock Periodization (BP)\n\nBlock periodization was originally proposed as a way to make periodization work for sports that had more than one major competition per year (since LP was originally only designed for a single major competition).  The original versions of BP had an offseason that looked basically identical to LP, with the addition of a “competitive block,” which consisted of training with just enough volume and intensity to allow for maintenance of performance without over-taxing the athlete during the competitive season.\n\nThe definition has shifted a bit more recently, and now BP is generally used to refer to training that starts with a block focused on strength endurance, followed by a block focused on hypertrophy, followed by a block focused on maximal strength, followed by a block focused on power and velocity (followed by a competitive block, if you’re dealing with a team sport athlete).\n\nNow, if you’re reading this and thinking “why are these things defined as separate forms of periodization?  They don’t seem mutually exclusive at all,” you’re right.  I’ll discuss that issue more later.  But basically, for the past 40+ years, prominent periodization theorists (Bondarchuk, Issurin, Matveyev, etc.) have been having public dick-measuring contests about whose model is best (and hence, why other models are inferior), which is largely why people have a tendency to treat them as completely separate concepts.  As a result, they’ve been researched as separate concepts.\n\n \n\nNotes about analysis\n\nJust to warn you, this section will probably be a slog.  If you trust that I didn’t mess anything up too badly, feel free to skip this section.  This section is for people who want to know exactly what I did so they can recreate my analyses or understand why I made some of the decisions I did with the analysis.\n\nThis project started by running a pubmed search for “periodization” and “periodize,” then mining sources from the extant reviews and meta-analyses on periodization and checking the reference lists of the studies I found.  The searched turned up 60 total articles, all of which are in this spreadsheet (if you want a copy, go “file” → “download,” or “make a copy”).\n\nMy intention was just to use normal meta-analytic procedures (i.e. calculate effect sizes and use a random effects model).  However, I ran into some issues with that approach.  Namely, several studies reported standard deviations so small that I simply couldn’t deem them credible, and, as a result, they’d lead to effect sizes so large I couldn’t deem them credible either.  For example, if you use the reported data in this study (pre-training bench press 1.28 ± 0.002 times body weight, with increases ranging from 0.13-0.42 times body weight), you’d wind up with within-group effect sizes ranging from 65-160, and between-group effect sizes ranging from 10-95.  That’s clearly ludicrous.  There were no other issues THAT major, but several other studies had standard deviations small enough (and hence, effect sizes large enough; i.e. 5+) that they made me very skeptical.\n\nAs a result, I just used percent changes.  Percent changes can be dangerous when used with individual studies since they’re sensitive to pre-training strength differences (giving an advantage to groups that are weaker to begin with), but there were enough studies included in all of these analyses that small pre-training strength differences would just wash out.  I also like percent changes for something like this since they’re easier for non-academic readers to understand intuitively.  I looked at the data four different ways:\n\nJust mean percent changes between the two things I was comparing (i.e. periodized vs. nonperiodized, or linear vs. undulating periodization) without any sort of fiddling.\nPercent changes per week.  Basically, you expect larger total strength gains in studies that run for a longer period of time, which can make differences between groups appear larger.  If one protocol lets people gain strength twice as fast, you may be looking at a 3% vs. 6% strength increase at 6 weeks, but a 6% vs. 12% strength increase at 12 weeks.  The difference to total percentage change is twice as large at 12 weeks (6% vs. 3%), but the difference in strength gains per week is the same (0.5% per week vs. 1% per week).\nMean percent changes, when pooling together all of the exercises within a single study.  This essentially makes sure one study can’t overpower the rest.  For example, if one study just tested the squat, it would have one data point in the analysis.  If another study tested squat, bench, leg press, and shoulder press, it would have four data points in the analysis.  You could argue that all those effects should be included independently to pick up on differences between exercises within a single study, or you could argue that you should pool within each study, since each study is essentially just testing one training program against another, so why let one comparison matter four times as much in your analysis?  In a similar vein, I also pooled the effects of different groups within a single study in this step.  For example, if I was doing a comparison of periodized and nonperiodized training, and one study had a nonperiodized group, an LP group, and a DUP group, I’d pool the effects seen in the LP and DUP groups here.\nMean (pooled) percent changes per week.\n\nPersonally, I think the second and the fourth options give the best comparison (the graphs you’ll see below will use option 4 when pooling trained and untrained lifters, and option 2 for everything else).  However, if any of the manipulations I described seem inappropriate or unnecessary to you, I can understand that as well.  In general, none of the analyses led to meaningfully different outcomes (I report when they did).  For reporting results, I just used the average of the four analyses; confidence intervals are the lowest bottom end to the highest upper end (just to be purposefully conservative with the CIs).\n\nOne last thing I did for comparisons is weighting means by the number of subjects in the study.  For example, if a study had 30 participants per group, its results would count 3x as much as a study with just 10 participants per group.  This ended up not actually changing much of anything, for what it’s worth (which is good – if you have big studies coming to dramatically different conclusions than small studies, you have a problem).\n\nThere were six main comparisons:  periodized vs. nonperiodized training for 1) all participants, 2) trained participants, and 3) untrained participants and linear vs. undulating periodization for 4) all participants, 5) trained participants, and 6) untrained participants.  Significance tests are all two-tailed paired samples t-tests, and effect sizes are all Cohen’s d (note: these are effect sizes between conditions once I’d run my analyses, not effect sizes for each study to be pooled for the analysis).\n\nI also looked to see whether periodization or periodization style had larger effects on squat or bench press (same sort of analysis as described above), and whether there was any evidence that periodization or a particular periodization style became more effective over time.  I did this by plotting differences between groups (dependent variable) and study lengths (independent variable), and seeing if the differences between groups for a given comparison tended to increase or decrease with study length, using simple linear regression.\n\nA couple final points:\n\nSince this isn’t a formal meta-analysis, I had a little more leeway to decide what studies and groups to include or exclude when running analyses.  Generally, I just went with studies using young, healthy people (so a couple of studies in the elderly were excluded), and included groups that were at least roughly matched for volume and intensity.  If this was a formal meta-analysis and I included “matched for volume and intensity” as a criteria, I’d have to exclude several studies that matched volume and intensity pretty closely, but not perfectly; if I didn’t include that as a criterion, I’d need to include studies like this that compared light, low-volume nonperiodized training against heavier, higher-volume periodized training.  Of note, I decided which studies to include and exclude before running any analyses.\nI only included studies that used dynamic, isotonic exercises (i.e. squat, bench press, leg press, shoulder press, etc.) since, I assume, most of us are interested in how periodization affects strength gains for dynamic, isotonic exercises.  This means I excluded a couple of studies that tested strength on a dynamometer or used isometric strength tests.\nIf you don’t like the studies I chose to analyze or exclude, or the way I analyzed things, feel free to use my spreadsheet to do things differently!  I already did a lot of the work for you, and I certainly wouldn’t claim that the way I analyzed things is the only way to go about it (or that I exhausted all the questions you could ask in this data set).\nIf you have any questions about exactly how I did things with my analysis, feel free to ask.  I’m trying to keep this section brief, as I realize 98% of people reading this article don’t care about this section one iota.  I like to nerd out about the details, though.\n\n \n\nResults\n\nThe studies included for review are in the table below.  Studies were excluded for several possible reasons, including participants’ characteristics (i.e. elderly or children), how strength was assessed (isometric or isokinetic), or details of the training programs used (i.e. block and reverse linear periodization didn’t have enough studies to make meaningful quantitative comparisons).\n\nAuthor (year)\tTraining status\tPeriodized vs. Nonperiodized?\tLinear vs. Undulating?\nAhmadizad (2014)\tUntrained\tYes\tYes\nApel (2011)\tTrained\tNo\tYes\nBaker (1994)\tTrained\tYes\tYes\nBuford (2007)\tUntrained\tNo\tYes\nde Lima (2012)\tUntrained\tNo\tYes\nEifler (2016)\tTrained\tYes\tYes\nHarris (2000)\tTrained\tYes\tNo\nHartmann (2009)\tTrained\tNo\tYes\nHerrick (1996)\tUntrained\tYes\tNo\nHoffman (2009)\tTrained\tYes\tYes\nHoffman (2003)\tTrained\tYes\tNo\nKok (2009)\tUntrained\tNo\tYes\nKraemer (2003)\tUntrained\tYes\tNo\nKramer (1997)\tTrained\tYes\tNo\nMiranda (2011)\tTrained\tNo\tYes\nMonteiro (2009)\tTrained\tYes\tYes\nMoraes (2013)\tUntrained\tYes\tNo\nO’Bryant (1988)\tUntrained\tYes\tNo\nPeterson (2008)\tTrained\tNo\tYes\nPrestes (2009)\tTrained\tNo\tYes\nRhea (2003)\tTrained\tNo\tYes\nSchiotz (1998)\tUntrained\tYes\tNo\nSchoenfeld (2016)\tTrained\tNo\tYes\nSimão (2012)\tUntrained\tNo\tYes\nSouza (2014)\tUntrained\tYes\tYes\nStone (2000)\tTrained\tYes\tNo\nWilloughby (1993)\tTrained\tYes\tNo\nPeriodized vs. Nonperiodized Overall\n\nDepending on how the data were analyzed, periodized training led to average strength gains of 21.78-23.62%, with average weekly strength gains of 1.96-2.05%.  Nonperiodized training, on the other hand, led to average strength gains of 18.90-19.10%, with average weekly strength gains of 1.59-1.70%.  These were significant differences in all analyses (p<0.05), and the associated effect sizes were all between 0.23-0.30 (classified as small effects).  On average, periodized groups gained strength about 22% faster (95% CI for all analyses: 2.80-39.26%).\n\nNote about these graphs: The top graph shows results from a single study. A line sloping down means faster gains with periodized training, while a line sloping up means faster gains with nonperiodized training. The bottom graph shows, from left to right, a box plot, the difference in results in each study (in this case, periodized minus nonperiodized, so a positive number means faster gains for periodized), and a 95% CI for the difference.\nLinear vs. Undulating Periodization Overall\n\nDepending on how the data were analyzed, undulating periodization led to average strength gains of 24.75-27.44%, with average weekly strength gains of 2.37-2.59%.  Linear periodization, on the other hand, led to average strength gains of 20.33-21.65%, with average weekly strength gains of 1.90-1.96%.  These were significant differences (p<0.05) in all but one analysis (pooled, non-weekly; p=0.08), and the associated effect sizes were all between 0.21-0.37 (classified as small effects).  On average, undulating groups gained strength about 17% faster (95% CI for all analyses: -0.88-36.60%).\n\nValues above zero mean faster gains for undulating\nPeriodized vs. Nonperiodized Untrained\n\nDepending on how the data were analyzed, periodized training led to average strength gains of 32.85-33.62%, with average weekly strength gains of 2.53-2.70%.  Nonperiodized training, on the other hand, led to average strength gains of 27.13-27.14%, with average weekly strength gains of 2.06-2.30%.  These were significant differences in total and weekly strength gains before pooling to account for multiple effects within studies (p<0.05), but not after pooling (p=0.06-0.15). The associated effect sizes were all between 0.23-0.30 (classified as small effects).  On average, periodized groups gained strength about 17.5% faster (95% CI for all analyses: -10.51-39.78%).\n\nValues above zero mean faster gains for periodized\nPeriodized vs. Nonperiodized Trained\n\nDepending on how the data were analyzed, periodized training led to average strength gains of 17.83-18.28%, with average weekly strength gains of 1.64-1.70%.  Nonperiodized training, on the other hand, led to average strength gains of 14.36-14.71%, with average weekly strength gains of 1.32-1.37%.  These were significant differences (p<0.05) in all but one analysis (pooled, non-weekly; p=0.12), and the associated effect sizes were all between 0.31-0.47 (classified as small effects).  On average, periodized groups gained strength about 23.5% faster (95% CI for all analyses: -3.42-49.28%).\n\nLinear vs. Undulating Untrained\n\nDepending on the analysis, the training in these studies led to strength gains of 25.09-27.70%, with average weekly strength gains of 2.38-2.67%.  None of the analyses revealed any differences that were remotely close to significant, and all effect sizes were trivial (d<0.12).\n\nLinear vs. Undulating Trained\n\nDepending on how the data were analyzed, undulating periodization led to average strength gains of 23.72-24.51%, with average weekly strength gains of 2.19-2.24%.  Linear periodization, on the other hand, led to average strength gains of 16.99-18.02%, with average weekly strength gains of 1.57-1.58%.  These were significant differences in all analyses (p<0.05), and the associated effect sizes were all between 0.56-0.76 (classified as medium effects).  On average, groups employing undulating periodization gained strength about 28% faster (95% CI for all analyses: 0.47-56.29%).\n\n \n\nSquat vs. Bench Press\n\nI found this bit very interesting:  periodization and periodization style seem to affect bench press, but not squat.\n\nAcross all studies, periodized training led to an average increase in bench strength of 1.35% per week, while nonperiodized training led to an average increase of just 0.87% per week.  On average, periodized training led to 55.43% faster bench gains (95% CI for all analyses: 22.43-88.43%, p<0.05).  However, periodized and nonperiodized training led to essentially identical squat gains:  1.87% vs. 1.83% per week.\n\nValues above zero mean faster gains for periodized\n\nAcross all studies, undulating periodization led to an average increase in bench strength of 1.63% per week, while linear periodization led to an average increase of just 1.28% per week.  On average, undulating periodization led to 26.55% faster bench gains (95% CI for all analyses: 1.73-51.37%, p<0.05).  However, undulating and linear periodization led to essentially identical squat gains:  2.35% vs. 2.36% per week, albeit with a sample of just six studies.\n\nValues above zero mean faster gains for undulating\nDo the effects of periodization or periodization style grow or shrink over time?\n\nIt’s unclear whether the advantage of periodized training over nonperiodized training increases or decreases over time.  When looking at studies on trained lifters, untrained lifters, and all cohorts, there were no significant relationships between study length and relative advantage of periodization.  When looking at individual studies that report strength gains at multiple time points, the picture is equally hazy.  For example, Willoughby et. al report that the advantage of periodized training grew monthly over the course of a 16-week study, while Kraemer et al report that the advantage of periodized training was largest near the beginning of a 32-week study, with the advantage progressively diminishing over time.  Of note, however, the effect of periodization on strength gains seems to be a bit larger (effect sizes of 0.31-0.46 vs. 0.23-0.30), and more consistent (significant effects in 3 of 4 analyses vs. 2 of 4 analyses) in trained lifters than in untrained lifters.\n\nThe advantage of undulating periodization over linear periodization may diminish over time.  There were no significant relationships between study length and relative advantage of periodization, but there was a moderately strong inverse relationship in untrained lifters (r = -0.52, r2 = 0.27, p = 0.09).  Furthermore, when looking at individual studies, all studies that ran longer than 12 weeks either found no difference between periodization styles, or they found that linear models outperformed undulating models.  However, that may be making a mountain out of a molehill, as several 12-week studies found that undulating models outperformed linear models, and the studies that ran longer than 12 weeks only ran for up to 16 weeks – not exactly a tremendous difference.\n\nX-axis = length of the study. Y-axis = strength gains per week with undulating periodization minus strength gains per week with linear periodization. Positive numbers mean faster gains with undulating periodization, while negative numbers mean faster gains with linear periodization.\nHypertrophy\n\nI’ll forgo my own analysis here, as there’s a very recent meta-analysis comparing the effects of UP and LP on hypertrophy, and an even more recent systematic review comparing the effects of periodized and nonperiodized training on hypertrophy (both by Grgic et al).  In short, it doesn’t seem that periodization or periodization style affects hypertrophy to any meaningful degree, at least in the short term. However, it’s worth pointing out that rarely are studies designed to compare competing training theories proposed to maximize hypertrophy.  Most of the time, studies use programs designed to maximize strength gains – strength is the primary outcome measure – and measures of hypertrophy are just secondary measures taken.  We’ll need more studies using programs designed specifically to maximize hypertrophy – with hypertrophy as the main outcome – in order to know for sure whether periodization or periodization style affects muscle growth.\n\nThis figure, displaying the results of Grgic et al, first appeared in Volume 1, Issue 7 of MASS.  Graphic credit:  Katherine Whitfield\nInterpretation\n\nHere are some general thoughts about this analysis, in no particular order:\n\n1) Overall, periodized training tends to produce larger strength gains than nonperiodized training, though the effect is pretty small.  Of note, however, the effect is a bit larger and more consistent in trained lifters than in untrained lifters.  The results here largely match those of Williams et al, once they removed outliers (i.e. studies comparing apples to oranges) and adjusted for nesting effects.  That makes me a little more confident that I didn’t screw anything up too badly, even though I used a somewhat more simplistic method of analysis.\n\n2) You can’t assume that findings in one population will apply to another population, or even that findings in one lift will apply to another lift.\n\nIn this case, undulating periodization seemed to do considerably better than linear periodization for trained lifters (in fact, this was the biggest difference observed in any of the main analyses – even bigger than the effect of periodized vs. nonperiodized training), while there was no difference whatsoever for untrained lifters.\nSimilarly, periodized training and undulating periodization beat the pants off nonperiodized training and linear periodization (respectively) for the bench press, while neither factor seemed to make any difference whatsoever for the squat.  However, to hedge this finding a bit, it’s also possible that the bench findings are just more trustworthy than the squat findings.  Rates of squat progress were 50-100% faster than rates of bench progress, possibly indicating lower overall training status for the squat (which makes sense – MOST people at the gym train bench harder than they train squat).  So it’s possible that the gains that came from just practicing the squat more drowned out any possible effects of periodization or periodization style, whereas the bench results let us see the “true” effects.\n\n3) Is undulating periodization just a short-term strategy that essentially peaks lifters?  If so, it would be good for short-term training, but may not be the best approach for long-term development.  There’s some weak evidence for that notion from these data, but I’d caution against this interpretation, at least for now.  The fact is, we don’t have any really long-term studies, and the trend seen with untrained lifters could have been a result of random variation.  I have a hard time believing that UP produces larger gains than LP, on average, at 12 weeks, but an additional 2-4 weeks is sufficient to flip the script.  Furthermore, since hypertrophy is similar with both LP and UP, I don’t see why you’d expect UP to fall short for long-term development.  However, this is a possibility worth keeping in the back of your mind as more research is published.\n\nProblems with the data\n\nThere are several problems with the research, in aggregate.  Some are relatively minor issues, and some are larger problems.\n\n1) The vast majority of the studies are pretty short.  One study made it into this analysis that was 32 weeks long, but all the rest were between 6 and 16 weeks.  As such, we have a fair amount of evidence about the short-term effects of periodization but very little data on the long-term effects.  It may be tempting to assume that the short-term differences would compound over time, but it’s also possible that differences would diminish over time as well (which I think is likely, since hypertrophy seems to be similar).  It’s also possible that novelty leads to short-term strength gains, with that effect diminishing over time (though I’m personally skeptical of that notion).\n\n2) Lack of studies on highly trained lifters.  I’m not the guy that joins in the “these guys didn’t even squat 600lbs, therefore this study is irrelevant.  Lol” powerlifter circlejerk since propensity for strength gains varies so much, and since powerlifting tends to select for people who are more gifted than average.  However, it’s hard to look at the rates of strength gains in the studies on trained lifters and conclude that most of these guys weren’t super well-trained.  The trained lifters in these studies were gaining strength at a clip of 1.32-2.24% per week.  That’s compared to a rate of 2.06-2.70% per week for untrained lifters.  Call me crazy, but most people I’d consider “trained” don’t gain strength at 75% the rate of completely untrained folks, and they’re certainly not getting 1.5-2% stronger per week.  As such, we’re left without much data on people most of us would really consider “trained lifters.”\n\n3) Lack of matched peak intensity.  This isn’t as much of an issue for the LP vs. UP studies, but it’s a major problem with the periodized training vs. nonperiodized training studies.  A typical study comparing periodized and nonperiodized training would have the nonperiodized group working with a moderate load (typically 70-75% 1RM, or 10RM loads) the whole time, while the periodized group would work with loads covering a larger range (maybe 60% 1RM to 90%1RM, or 15RM to 3RM loads).  Average intensity and volume would be matched, but ultimately, the periodized group would get practice with loads closer to 1RM loads, meaning they had an element of increased specificity compared to the nonperiodized group.  In that case, are you really testing the effects of periodization per se, or are you (perhaps primarily) testing the effects of specificity?\n\n4) Lack of standardization.  The definitions of different periodization models can be a little slippery, and that’s reflected in the programs used in these studies.  It would take forever to point out all of the examples of this, but you can see it in my spreadsheet.  In the “program label” column, I made note of all of the classifications I thought a particular program design could have conformed to.  With nonperiodized training and DUP, this was typically fairly straightforward, but a lot of the LP, WUP, and BP studies arguably incorporated other periodization elements.\n\n5) Testing either/or hypotheses.  This is the complete opposite problem from problem 4.  I’m honestly not convinced science is equipped to do a good job of answering questions about different periodization models.  In science, you’re supposed to control all variables to the best of your ability apart from the one being tested – in this case, periodization model.  However, in the real world, these concepts are almost never applied in an either/or way.  You can undulate volume and intensity within a week if you train a lift multiple times, organize your training into discrete multi-week blocks with specific purposes, and progress intensity week-to-week to block-to-block all within the same training program, thus incorporating undulating, block, and linear elements.  It doesn’t make much sense to me to test linear vs. undulating periodization, as if they’re two entirely disparate concepts, unless you’re also going to add in another group incorporating both linear and undulating aspects to see whether the two models have a beneficial interaction (no studies do this).  Testing most ecologically valid hypotheses regarding periodization would require some uncontrolled variables (not gonna get published), or a ton of groups to test multiple interactions (not gonna get funded, and recruitment/logistics would be a nightmare), but the current approach of just testing models against each other doesn’t provide us with data that’s super useful in the real world, in my opinion.\n\n6) This is a somewhat pedantic point, but I’m also not crazy about individual studies claiming to test “linear periodization vs. undulating periodization.”  Ultimately, an individual study is just testing one training program against another training program.  The two programs may serve as examples of two different periodization styles (or periodized training and nonperiodized training), but you can’t assume they serve as tremendously good representatives for an entire classification of possible programs.  I think you need a big-picture overview (like this one) to meaningfully test hypotheses about periodization, incorporating the results from multiple studies using multiple programs that fall under the same umbrella of periodization style.  This critique is similar to the “don’t put too much faith in a single study because the results of a single study may be off,” critique, but it’s a bit stronger.  Something more like, “don’t put too much faith in a single periodization study, because one study isn’t capable of meaningfully testing a hypothesis about entire periodization models using single training programs in the first place.”\n\nTakeaways\nPeriodized training seems to produce faster, larger strength gains than nonperiodized training, regardless of training status.  It’s not going to be a night-and-day difference, but it does seem to be a pretty consistent, meaningful effect.\nIt’s probably wise to incorporate some undulations into trained lifters’ programs, and since DUP has been used more frequently in the research than WUP, it’s the option with more evidence to support it at the moment.  Undulations may not affect strength gains for untrained lifters.  Again, this doesn’t mean incorporating undulating at the exclusion of linear or block periodization elements.  Those can (and probably should) be integrated.\nPeriodization and periodization style may matter more for bench than for squat.  I’d want to see some studies on powerlifters (who should be equally trained in both the bench and the squat) to be super confident with this takeaway, though.\nPeriodization and periodization style don’t seem to affect hypertrophy, at least in the literature we currently have.  This is to be expected, as most research equates volume between training programs, and volume is by far the biggest driver of hypertrophy.  However, it’s possible (likely, I’d argue) that periodized plans designed to progressively increase volume over time would lead to greater hypertrophy than nonperiodized plans, or periodized plans that don’t focus on progressively increasing volume.  That’s a hypothesis for future research to test.\nIdeas for future periodization research\n\n1) Consider having a standardized peaking block to follow the differentiated training intervention.  This could help control for the differences in peak intensity seen in the studies comparing periodized training and nonperiodized training.  If the folks doing nonperiodized training had big spikes in strength after a peaking block of heavier training, leading to the same overall outcomes as the folks doing periodized training, that would suggest that there may not actually be a meaningful difference for long-term development.\n\n2) In a similar vein, it would be worth doing a study comparing periodized and nonperiodized training where training intensity of the nonperiodized group is matched to the peak intensity of the periodized group.  If there ended up being no differences between groups, this would suggest that prior periodization research was confounded by higher specificity in the periodized groups (i.e. the differences would be more attributable to specificity than periodization per se).  If there ended up still being a difference, with the periodized group gaining more strength, that would suggest that there is an actual benefit of periodization itself.\n\n3) Future studies should replace a control group with an integrated group.  It always irks me a bit when I see a resistance training study include a control group in the first place (for the most part; there are times when one is needed.  This is not one of those times).  We should know by now that lifting weights makes you stronger than not lifting weights.  Instead, for studies comparing two periodization models, the control group could be replaced by a group using a combined program.  For example, a study comparing linear and daily undulating periodization could have a linear group, and daily undulating group, and a third group matching average weekly intensity with the linear group, but still undulating within each week.  This would test to see if the two models being used had an additive or synergistic effect.  If it was found that the DUP group got better results than the LP group, but that the combined group got results similar to the DUP group, that would suggest that the difference in results was primarily due to the undulations, whereas if the combined group got better results than both other groups, that would suggest an additive or synergistic effect, meaning DUP and LP should be integrated.\n\n4) Future studies should allow session volume to be autoregulated (RPE/RIR or bar speed cutoffs would make the most sense).  It’s all well and good to test the effects of different periodization models when volume is equated, but people also hypothesize that certain models are superior because they allow people to handle more training volume.  Allowing autoregulated volume would let you test this hypothesis, while also making the programs themselves more ecologically valid.\n\n5) This can come off as a bit of a lazy complaint, but we really need studies with more highly trained lifters, and studies lasting longer (6-12+ months).  Periodization is supposedly focused on long-term planning and athletic development, and is supposedly useful for helping high-level athletes continue to improve.  We can’t really test those hypotheses without…long-term study and studies on high-level lifters (or, ideally, long-term studies on high-level lifters).  I get that recruitment would be a bitch and that getting participants to enough training sessions and having people available to manage all the training sessions around breaks/vacations/etc. would be a logistical nightmare (which is why I’m not volunteering to do it!), but until that work is done, discussing periodization models for long-term strength development in high-level lifters isn’t science.  It’s speculation.\n\n6) We need periodization studies designed with hypertrophy as the primary outcome to really test whether periodization or periodization style affects hypertrophy.  As noted before, strength is typically the primary outcome, so studies typically don’t use programs designed to maximize hypertrophy.  Intensity is usually the main variable periodized, and volume just comes along for the ride.  On the other hand, a study testing periodized vs. nonperiodized training for hypertrophy would need to treat volume as the primary variable periodized.  For example, a nonperiodized group may do 10 sets of bench per week for 15 weeks, while a periodized group may do three-week blocks of 4 sets, 7 sets, 10 sets, 13 sets, and 16 sets per week.\n\nWrapping it up\n\nHey!  You made it this far.  If you want to read even more about periodization, here are some sources I’d strongly recommend.  If you haven’t picked up on this by now, I’m interested enough in periodization to sink probably 100 hours of my life into reading all of these studies, conducting this analysis, and writing this article, but I’m also pretty skeptical and, in some ways, disappointed with the literature as it currently stands.  I think there’s still merit in the extant literature, but I think the current findings are often used to support massively extrapolated conclusions, and I think there’s plenty of room for improvement moving forward.  If you share my skepticism, you’ll enjoy these three pieces:\n\nPeriodization paradigms in the 21st century: evidence-led or tradition-driven?\nIs Empirical Research on Periodization Trustworthy? A Comprehensive Review of Conceptual and Methodological Issues\nPeriodization Theory: Confronting an Inconvenient Truth\n\nAlso, if you don’t trust my analysis, feel free to check out the reviews and meta-analyses on the topic.  I referred to the Grgic reviews of hypertrophy directly, and my conclusions regarding periodized vs. nonperiodized training largely match Williams’, so I’m pretty confident in my analysis there.  However, I believe my conclusion that UP outperforms LP for trained but not untrained lifters is a novel finding (Harries’ UP vs. LP meta didn’t investigate that question), along with my finding that periodized training and UP outperform nonperiodized training and LP (respectively) for the bench press but not the squat.\n\nComparison of Periodized and Non-Periodized Resistance Training on Maximal Strength: A Meta-Analysis.\nA meta-analysis of periodized versus nonperiodized strength and power training programs.\nEffects of linear and daily undulating periodized resistance training programs on measures of muscle hypertrophy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nShould resistance training programs aimed at muscular hypertrophy be periodized?

In this 12-week study, smith machine back squat 1RM and quadriceps CSA were measured pre-training, at the mid-point of the study (6 weeks) and at the end of the study. One group used nonperiodized training, one group followed a linear periodized approach, and one group followed a DUP approach. Over the entire 12 weeks, strength gains and hypertrophy were similar in all three groups.  However, strength gains slowed dramatically during the second half of the study for the subjects in the nonperiodized group (+3.7% from week 6 to week 12), and still progressed at a decent clip in the two periodized groups (+6.6% for DUP, and +8.8% for LP), suggesting that periodized training would be the superior choice for strength gains long-term.\n\nThe more interesting study, in my opinion, is the second one. If you’ll remember, I argued that the superiority of periodized training for strength gains may simply be attributable to the fact that in most study designs, periodized training programs include heavy training (85%+, or 3-5RM), while nonperiodized plans generally stick exclusively to moderate loads (70-80%, or 8-12RM loads). As such, we can’t know whether the enhanced strength gains are driven by periodization per se, or whether they’re simply driven by specificity.  This study provided the first “fair” comparison in the literature. One group in this study used a nonperiodized approach, while the other used a weekly undulating periodized approach. Both groups trained with 4-6RM loads, 10-15RM loads, and 20-25RM loads.  The nonperiodized group did two sets per session in each loading zone, while the WUP group did six sets in a single loading zone each session, alternating loading zones each week.  As such, total volume, average intensity, and peak intensity were the same in both groups. Unsurprisingly (to me, at least), strength gains (leg press 1RM) were the same in both groups. I don’t want to make too big of a fuss over a single study, but I would really like to see more studies use a similar design (matching for volume, average intensity, and peak intensity) when comparing periodized and nonperiodized training.\n\n \n\nAddendum, July 2018\n\nA new study by Rodrigues et al. provides us with more data comparing linear and undulating periodization in lifters with some prior training experience. Long story short, both set-ups caused similar strength increases in the bench press and triceps pushdown.  However, pre-training, the undulating group was almost twice as strong as the linear group, with an average bench press of 91kg compared to 54.7kg in the linear group.  So, it’s possible that undulating periodization was more effective, but that its effectiveness was masked by groups that were dissimilar at baseline (assuming that weaker, less experienced people tend to gain strength faster than stronger, more experienced people).\n\n \n\nRead Next\nPeriodization: History and Theory\nThe Complete Strength Training Guide\nThe “Hypertrophy Range” – Fact or Fiction?\nShare this on Facebook & join in the conversation\nGreg Nuckols\nGreg Nuckols has over a decade of experience under the bar, a BS in Exercise and Sports Science, and a Master's in Exercise Physiology.

    "content": "Avoiding Cardio Could Be Holding You Back\nby Greg Nuckols\nArticles, Cardio, Programming\nWhat you’re getting yourself into\n\n~3100 words\n8-12 minute read time\n\nKey Points\nLifting heavy things is more metabolically taxing than most people realize.\nMost people think of weight training as a purely anaerobic enterprise, but the majority of the energy you use to train is produced by your aerobic energy system.\nCardiovascular training can improve your recovery between sets and workouts, and won’t interfere with strength or muscle gains if you do it correctly.\nLow intensity cardio should be prioritized over interval training for the most part.\n\nT\nhusfar, most of the articles on this site that have discussed cardiovascular training have dealt primarily with why it’s not the devil – why it won’t make you weak.\n\nThis article deals with how it can be used to enhance your training and actually help you get stronger, faster.\n\nYou’ll notice that I won’t be citing as much research in this article as usual. That’s because the bulk of this information comes from four main sources:\n\nMy Exercise Physiology textbook. A lot of the ground covered in this article simply relates to basic aerobic physiology.\nThe work of Joel Jamieson. He’s got a LOT of great resources that address this stuff. I’d highly recommend his book “Ultimate MMA Conditioning,” and if you’d like a brief primer on his work, you should check out this lecture.\nThese two fantastic review articles (One, Two).\nDiscussions with my friend Alex Viada, who specializes in improving peoples’ endurance while also making them jacked.  If this subject interests you, I’d highly recommend his book The Hybrid Athlete.\nFirst things first – a very brief overview of energy systems.\n\nYour body’s No. 1 priority is staying alive. To do that, it has to produce energy at roughly the same rate you expend it. The metabolic currency of your body is ATP. There are two main ways your body regenerates ATP to produce energy: with oxygen (aerobic) or without oxygen (anaerobic).\n\nYour body can produce energy much faster anaerobically. The fastest way is by using stored ATP, and replenishing ATP directly from phosphocreatine (PCr). However, this only lasts for 8-12 seconds. The next fastest way is by anaerobic glycolysis, which lasts for a few minutes, but which also causes acute muscular fatigue pretty quickly and doesn’t harvest very much ATP per molecule of glucose used.\n\nYour body can produce energy aerobically for a very, very long time, getting every little bit of ATP out of each molecule of glucose or fat used. However, aerobic energy production is quite a bit slower than anaerobic energy production.\n\nA one-rep max attempt relies almost exclusively on the anaerobic energy systems, particularly the anaerobic alactic (ATP/PCr) system. So, the thinking goes, since the aerobic energy system is almost entirely irrelevant when you’re on the platform, it must not matter very much for powerlifting.\n\nThis article explores why that’s shortsighted thinking. While your aerobic system isn’t doing much for you when you’re actually on the platform, it very strongly influences how hard you can train, which is ultimately what allows you to put up big numbers on the platform.\n\nContext\n\nLifting weight is metabolically taxing. Studies have found that doing 4 sets of 8 deadlifts with 175 kilograms burns about 100 calories. That’s roughly the amount of energy you’d burn running a mile if you weigh 130lbs, or running half a mile if you weigh 260lbs. Those numbers may not mean much to you right now, but I’ll show you why they’re important later.\n\nCost\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind is the “cost” of producing a given amount of energy aerobically versus anaerobically. We fatigue during exercise for a variety of reasons. I won’t even try to go through all of them here (and even if I did, all I could do is recount the best guesses we have right now. Because fatigue is so multifactorial and difficult to study, we really don’t know for sure what causes it, in all – or most – cases), but it’s pretty well-understood that burning through a ton of energy anaerobically in a short period of time is quite a bit more fatiguing than producing energy aerobically.\n\nThis is due to both local and central factors. Local factors have to do with substrate depletion (burning through PCr stores and, to a lesser degree, muscle glycogen), changes in ion concentrations that decrease the excitability of the muscle, and increases in metabolite concentrations and rather large decreases in muscle pH that can influence how hard the muscle can actually contract. Central factors mainly have to do with decreased oxygen availability, increases in certain inflammatory chemicals, a slight drop in blood pH, and other such factors that increase your brain’s perception of fatigue.\n\nWith aerobic energy production, you get a more modest drop in muscle pH and a much slower depletion of energy substrates. Central fatigue can certainly set in eventually, but it takes MUCH longer – usually accumulated fatigue after hours of continuous, strenuous activity or weeks of hard training.\n\nEssentially, the more energy you can produce aerobically to meet a certain demand, the less you have to produce anaerobically, so the less fatiguing a given amount of training will be.\n\nReps and Fatigue Per Set\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that even things we consider purely anaerobic still have an aerobic contribution, and it’s often larger than we think. For instance, this study showed that even for a 200m sprint (~20 seconds of all-out effort), about 30% of the energy produced was produced aerobically. For the 400m, 800m, and 1500m runs (considered heavily anaerobic events – especially the 400m and 800m), the aerobic energy system was already contributing more than half the energy produced by 15-30 seconds into the run. Even for relatively short efforts (like a heavy set of 5) the aerobic system is producing almost a third of the energy needed, and for higher rep sets, it’s producing more than half the energy.\n\nThe implication: The more powerful your aerobic energy system, the more reps you’ll be able to do with a given weight or percentage of your max, because every bit of energy you can produce aerobically is that much less that you have to produce anaerobically, which pushes off those factors that cause acute muscular fatigue. Also, if you do the same number of reps with a given amount of weight, less of the energetic contribution will come from your anaerobic energy systems, so the set will be less fatiguing. So you’re either looking at more work and the same fatigue, or the same amount of work with less fatigue; either way, you win.\n\nThis actually relates to a past article about sex differences: Women can generally do more reps with a given percentage of their 1rm because they generally have higher aerobic and lower anaerobic capacity per pound of lean body mass than men.\n\nRecovery Between Sets\n\nAlthough you’re obviously very reliant on your anaerobic system when you’re actually lifting the weights, what energy system do you think you use to recover between sets?\n\nYour aerobic system is what produces the energy necessary to restore intracellular ATP and PCr levels, metabolize lactate, and generally get you headed back toward homeostasis so you can perform the next set. Better aerobic conditioning means you’ll recover faster between sets (and since you’ll be somewhat less reliant on your anaerobic system for each set, they’ll be less fatiguing in the first place) so you can handle higher total training volume.\n\nIf You Plan on Getting Stronger\n\nLet’s revisit the studies showing that you burn about 100 calories deadlifting 175kg for 4 sets of 8. We’re going to use those numbers as a yardstick for a bit.\n\nThey found that energy expenditure was directly (and quite strongly) correlated to the amount of work being done. Work scales directly with the amount of weight on the bar. Lifting 100kg is twice as much work as lifting 50kg.\n\nSo, if you deadlift 175kg for a set of 8, you burn ~25 calories. If you deadlift 87.5 for a set of 8, you’d only burn about 12.5 calories. If you deadlift 350kg for a set of 8, you’d burn about 50 calories.\n\nThis is why a new lifter may be able to bang out sets of 10 squats while barely breaking a sweat, whereas a tough set of 10 may floor a stronger lifter. If you’re lifting twice as much weight, you’re burning through twice as much energy in the same amount of time, probably with a larger proportion coming from anaerobic sources.\n\nSo, if you plan on getting stronger – especially if you plan on getting really strong – it would probably behoove you to improve your aerobic conditioning. If it’s not a limiting factor now, it very well may become one as your lifts increase.\n\nAs The Workout Wears On\n\nAs you move through a workout, you become even more reliant on your aerobic energy system. One study illustrated this beautifully using 30-second rounds of all-out cycling, interspersed with 4 minutes of rest. Total work dropped from 18.7kJ in the first round to 13.8kJ by the third, illustrating the effect of fatigue.\n\nMore importantly, however, this study showed how the participants were producing energy for each round. These charts show the difference between their first and third sprints.\n\nFrom Parolin, 1999\n\n \n\nIn the first, ATP/PCr and anaerobic glycolysis carry most of the load for the first six seconds, ATP/PCr drops off between 6-15 seconds while the aerobic system picks up more of the load, and by the last 15 seconds the aerobic system is doing about 50-60% of the work.\n\nContrast that with the third sprint where anaerobic glycolysis is nowhere to be found, and the aerobic system is doing the vast majority of the work from 6 seconds onward. Basically, after the first sprint, ATP/PCr gives you a 6 second burst, but after that, it’s all up to the aerobic system.\n\nYou may be thinking, “But Greg, I’m lifting weights, not cycling. And besides, aren’t those all-out bike sprints supposed to be the most brutal thing in the world?”\n\nNot quite. They’re the most brutal test that’s used consistently in research, but only because there aren’t enough 700-pound squatters for the “set of 10 squats with 500lbs” protocol to be very popular.\n\nThe brutal cycling sprints are known as the Wingate Test, and going off normative data I found, they don’t hold a candle to our set of 8 deadlifts with 175kg. The mean for average power in the Wingate Test (for men) is 562.7 Watts, and the highest value in the dataset was 711.0 Watts. Watts are Joules per second, so you multiply those numbers by 30 to get Joules (16,881 average and 21,330 for the highest value), divide by 1000 to get kilojoules (16.9 and 21.3, respectively) then divide by 4.184 to get kcals (4.04kcals and 5.09kcals).  Since energetic efficiency for cycling is roughly 25% – meaning for every calorie burned, you only do about .25 calories worth of work on the bike – you end up looking at total caloric expenditure of 15-20kcals.\n\nSo a set of 8 deadlifts with 175kg burns roughly 25-60% more calories in roughly the same amount of time as the brutal Wingate Test. Similar values were obtained for the study referenced above – 18.7kJ on the first sprint is about 4.47kcals of work and 18kcals burned, and 13.8kJ on the third sprint is a scant 3.30kcals of work and 13kcals burned.\n\nAll of which means, the huge shift away from anaerobic reliance and toward aerobic reliance from sprint 1 to sprint 3 not only applies to picking up heavy things, but probably understates the degree of the shift since the energy demands per set are considerably higher, especially if you’re quite strong. Unless you’re only doing heavy singles or doubles (to fit within that short window where you can rely strongly on ATP/PCr), your training probably relies at least as much (and probably more) on your aerobic energy system as your anaerobic energy system.\n\nInjury Risk\n\nAthletes become more susceptible to injury as they become fatigued. They lose a bit of coordination, and muscles themselves become less capable of absorbing force before a muscle strain occurs.\n\nI’m not going to pretend like I have data to support this point, but I have seen my fair share of weight room injuries (and have had my own share of little muscle strains), and it’s pretty rare to see someone get injured on their first heavy set or two. It generally seems to happen later in the workout after fatigue has started to accumulate, which makes sense: more fatigue = more susceptible to injury. It doesn’t seem like too much of a stretch to assume that better aerobic fitness – meaning less fatigue per set and better recovery between sets – could reduce your injury risk in the gym.\n\nRecovery Between Sessions\n\nA central adaptation to aerobic exercise is increased parasympathetic nervous system (“rest and digest”) activity and decreased sympathetic nervous system (“fight or flight”) activity at rest. This means that between workouts, your body stays in a more robust recovery state.\n\nSubstrate Usage\n\nAnother adaptation to aerobic training is decreased carbohydrate usage and increased fat usage at any exercise intensity. This is probably more beneficial for a sport like CrossFit that has higher volume workouts, and whose competitions include multiple events per day over multiple days – sparing as much muscle glycogen as possible becomes a precious thing. But even in the case of powerlifting, a shift in substrate usage could make a small difference, especially in a calorie deficit if glycogen stores are already low since glycogen concentrations influence perceived exertion; low glycogen just makes everything feel harder, and improved aerobic capacity spares glycogen.\n\nBy Lance Cpl. Sarah Wolff [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\nDrawbacks\n\nNow that I’ve made aerobic training sound like the best thing since sliced bread, it’s time to discuss the drawbacks. The most obvious is the “interference effect.”\n\nA lot of the ways your body tries to adapt to aerobic training are in direct opposition to the ways your body tries to adapt to resistance training. Different metabolic pathways (AMPK vs. mTOR, though that’s not as problematic as most people think), using energy toward muscle protein synthesis vs. mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulation of aerobic vs. glycolytic enzymes, etc.\n\nHowever, rumors of the interference effect, it seems, have been greatly exaggerated. At least, the meta-analysis on the subject found that it’s not aerobic exercise per se that causes the interference effect, but rather running in particular, probably related to the repeated eccentric stress of running. Cycling, on the other hand, did not hinder strength and muscle gains when combined with strength training.\n\nExactly zero track cyclists reading this article are at all surprised by that finding (refer to the picture at the top of the article).\n\nThe other drawback is simply the time commitment. Yes, it takes time. However, keep in mind that when talking about cardiovascular training for powerlifters, the goal isn’t to log 100 miles per week to qualify for the Boston marathon. It’s to attain a basic level of conditioning to fuel the energetic demands of training. For most people, you can accomplish that in 2 hours per week or less.\n\nCan’t I Just Lift Weights?\n\nYes. Sort of. Actually, training to muscular failure has been shown to cause robust gains in aerobic capacity. However, most of the gains result from local tissue-level adaptations, not the global adaptations that come with dedicated cardiovascular training (increased cardiac stroke volume and increased oxygen carrying capacity being two biggies.  They may be increased somewhat with strength training, but not to the same degree). These tissue-level adaptations shouldn’t be discounted, but if all you do is lift weights to failure, you’re still missing out on some of the potential benefits.\n\nWhat About Intervals?\n\nThe answer for this is essentially the same as the previous one: Yes, interval training can improve aerobic capacity by itself, and yes, it’s much more time-effective than low-intensity cardio. Intervals also improve anaerobic capacity to a much greater degree than aerobic training does. However, while you get some of the benefits you’d get from low intensity cardio, you don’t get all of them.\n\nFurthermore, interval training is much more “costly” in terms of recovery, related to those central fatigue factors I briefly touched on earlier. Hopping on a stationary bike for 30 minutes with your HR at 130-135 won’t really affect your training very much tomorrow. Doing a few tough rounds of intervals (assuming you’re going hard enough to actually make them effective) can really put a dent in your ability to recover from your strength training, though. The idea of improving your conditioning in less time while doing fun movements sounds great on paper, but you pay for these advantages in how intervals can negatively impact the rest of your training.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nThe best conditioning plan for powerlifting will combine several different modalities (low intensity cardio, lifting to failure, and high intensity intervals) with an emphasis on minimizing the impact conditioning work will have on your heavy strength training.\n\nMy general recommendations:\n\nStart slow. 2 sessions per week, both low intensity, and only 20-30 minutes per session with your HR around 130, or 60-70% of max heart rate. A bike is best, but incline treadmill walking is also a good alternative.\nOnly increase aerobic training load when you need to. Track your resting heart rate (measured first thing in the morning) and the work rate you have to maintain to hit a HR of 130. As long as your resting heart rate is trending down and/or you can pedal faster/against more resistance or walk faster/at a greater incline week to week, then don’t make increases.\nMake increases slowly – 10 minutes more aerobic work per week. Evaluate your conditioning as you go. Your resting HR should end up somewhere in the 50s, and you shouldn’t have any issues recovering between sets. You should notice that the amount of training you can handle has increased quite noticeably as fatigue during training decreases, and recovery from training increases. Once you find your minimum effective dose for maintaining that level of conditioning, stay there – don’t do more for its own sake.\nOnce you reach three weekly sessions of 40 minutes apiece (again, only making increases as needed), evaluate your level of conditioning again if you’re still not sufficiently conditioned (see the previous point).\nIf your aerobic fitness plateaus at that level of low-intensity training, you may need to start including interval training. Start conservatively – 3-4 rounds of 1 minute intervals with 2-3 minutes of rest in between. Choose low-skill movements (NOT sprinting or weightlifting) like cycle sprints or kettlebell swings. Again, monitor improvements and only increase as necessary.\nDo 2-3 sets to failure per muscle group, per week. Save this for your accessory work – going to true failure on squats or deadlifts regularly probably isn’t the smartest idea. You can get the same local aerobic adaptations with safer exercises. This is perfect for isolation work, actually.

    "content": "How does sleep deprivation affect your workouts?\nby Milo Wolf\nDecember 17, 2025\nCan you still train effectively after a bad night, or is it better to rest and recover?\n\nSleep is one of those topics where the advice seems obvious: get more of it. But how much does missing a few hours actually hurt your gym performance? Can you still train effectively after a bad night, or is it better to rest and recover? Let’s look at what the research says.\n\nFirst, we need to establish what actually happens when you get a bad night’s sleep. Sure, working out can feel worse, but how does a bad night’s sleep impact your performance objectively?\n\nA recent meta-analysis by Craven et al examined 69 studies with 227 outcomes on how acute sleep loss (≤6 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period) affected exercise performance.\nThe authors categorized exercise tasks into seven types:\n\nAnaerobic power\nStrength and strength-endurance\nSpeed/power endurance\nEndurance\nSkill-based tasks\nHigh-intensity intervals\n\n\nAcross almost every category, sleep loss impaired performance. The biggest decline was seen in skill-based tasks: things requiring fine motor control, coordination, or precision. In contrast, strength and power performance were affected a fair bit less, but still consistently dropped.\n\nWhile this finding was relatively robust, the magnitude of the effect is worth noting. On average, for every hour participants were awake before training, performance declined by roughly 0.4%. That doesn’t sound dramatic, but missing several hours of sleep can feel like it adds up. For example, if you get only 4 hours of sleep before a workout, you could expect to be around 2-3% weaker that day – roughly the difference between hitting your usual last rep or failing the set a rep early.\n\nInterestingly, though, not all sleep loss was equal. The pattern of sleep restriction matters.\n\nTotal sleep deprivation – think an all-nighter – or late-night restriction tended to hurt performance the most.\n\nOn the flip-side, early restriction – think waking up earlier than usual, but going to bed at the usual time – had a smaller impact.\n\nLikewise, the time of day that training took place seemed to matter. Workouts done in the evening after poor sleep suffered more than morning sessions, likely because fatigue and sleep pressure accumulated throughout the day. So, if you have to train after a bad night, an early session might be the lesser evil.\n\nSimilarly, if you have some work you need to get done ASAP, this suggests you’d be better off waking up early to get some work done than going to bed late to finish it off. Training early might help too.\n\nGiven the positive impacts of exercise on sleep duration and quality, it’s usually worth getting a workout in, even after a bad night’s sleep, though you may find it easier to do so by reducing difficulty a bit.\n\nBut fundamentally, what gives? Besides feeling dreadful, why does one night of bad sleep impact workout performance?\n\nA review by Fullagar et al suggests there are likely a few factors that contribute:\n\nIncreased sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic activity, resembling early overreaching.\nGlycogen repletion can be impaired after severe sleep deprivation.\nSlightly increased inflammation.\nCognitively, slower reactions, worse decision-making.\nReduced motor memory consolidation.\n\nTo close us out, here are a few practical takeaways on how sleep deprivation impacts your workouts and how to adjust your approach:\n\nAcute sleep loss does reliably negatively impact workout performance\nHowever, this is a larger effect for skill-based tasks vs strength and power.\nOne bad night won’t make-or-break anything.\nA single night’s poor sleep may lower performance, but it’s unlikely to blunt long-term adaptations if your overall sleep is decent.\nPrioritize recovery after sleep loss.\n If possible, shift harder sessions to another day or reduce load slightly.\nWhen training sleep-deprived:\nOpt for morning workouts if your schedule allows.\nIf you have the choice:\nOpt to go to bed at your usual time but wake up early. This pattern appears to compromise performance a bit less.\nGet these newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe Stronger By Science weekly newsletter features practical training tips and summaries of the latest research.

In nature, caffeine serves as a natural pesticide that plants produce to keep insects from eating them. In the modern human diet, caffeine is a remarkably common component of numerous foods and beverages, and recent estimates suggest that up to 85% of US adults regularly consume caffeine. Average adult caffeine intakes vary among countries; Americans consume about 186mg per day, while the estimate is 260mg per day in Japan, and is likely higher in the world’s leaders in coffee consumption, including Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Sweden.\n\nCaffeine finds its way into tea, coffee, soft drinks, chocolate, and medications, in addition to most pre-workout supplements on the market. Aside from being present in some delicious foods and beverages, caffeine has long been touted as a performance-enhancing supplement. If true, that would be pretty cool, because there aren’t many ergogenic ingredients with potential to sneak their way into your diet via affordable, easily accessible sources that taste great. However, it’s only cool if caffeine actually does enhance performance in a safe and reliable manner. This article discusses what caffeine does in the body, how it affects strength performance, and whether or not health and safety concerns about caffeine are warranted.\n\nTable Of Contents\nHow might caffeine improve strength?\n\nBefore discussing the studies evaluating the strength effects of caffeine, it’s important to know how caffeine is supposed to work. It’s hard to critically evaluate a body of literature if you don’t really know what you’re looking for or why you should expect to find it. Humans have been consuming caffeine for ages, and we’ve been studying it for an impressively long time. As reviewed by Perkins and Williams, there are formal research reports about caffeine’s ergogenic properties dating all the way back to 1893. As early as 1939, scientists were calling for bans of highly concentrated caffeine products in athletic competition. Despite this rich history of caffeine research, there’s still a bit of confusion pertaining to the mechanisms by which it may enhance performance.\n\nCatecholamines\n\nIn terms of modern caffeine research, much of the early work investigated aerobic endurance exercise outcomes and the mechanisms underlying such performance effects. Interest was focused almost exclusively toward peripheral mechanisms occurring outside of the central nervous system (CNS). For example, there were studies showing that caffeine increased the catecholamine response to exercise, resulting in higher blood concentrations of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). While dopamine is also a catecholamine, the exercise literature tends to focus on epinephrine and norepinephrine because their exercise-induced changes are large and easy to measure, and they are known to have widespread effects throughout the body that are relevant to exercise, such as bronchodilation, tissue-specific vasodilation and vasoconstriction, carbohydrate and fat mobilization, and increased cardiac output.\n\nIn the caffeine research, one of the prevailing theories was that catecholamines increased glycolytic flux by enhancing glucose availability and stimulating glycolysis, thereby enabling the body to sustain high power output by utilizing carbohydrate more effectively for energy. This premise is indirectly supported by a number of studies showing increased blood glucose following caffeine ingestion, and studies showing simultaneous increases in lactate production and performance. Unfortunately, as reviewed by Davis and Green, it doesn’t seem like this hypothesis adequately explains the performance effects of caffeine. While there is little doubt that catecholamines can contribute to some of the numerous physiological effects we observe following caffeine ingestion, such as enhanced alertness, increased heart rate, and elevated blood pressure, they’re unlikely to be the primary driver of performance improvements. There are studies showing caffeine to increase catecholamine levels and improve performance in the absence of increased glycolytic flux, studies showing increased glycolytic flux in the absence of increased catecholamines, increased catecholamine levels have not consistently been shown to yield performance improvements, and performance improvements with caffeine have been observed in the absence of substantial catecholamine changes. In short, the theory sounds great, but the evidence doesn’t support it in a reliable manner.\n\nFat oxidation and glycogen sparing\n\nIn the early caffeine literature, it became apparent that caffeine was particularly helpful for increasing performance of prolonged endurance activities. It was speculated that caffeine might have been enhancing fat oxidation, thereby saving glycogen for when it was truly needed during prolonged exercise. Caffeine certainly causes an acute increase in free fatty acid mobilization; this is likely caused by a combination of antagonism of A1-adenosine receptors and catecholamine release. While caffeine has been shown to inhibit phosphodiesterase in vitro, and phosphodiesterase inhibition would enhance lipolysis and sparing of glycogen, it’s unlikely that a person would consume caffeine at a high enough dose to meaningfully inhibit phosphodiesterase. Nonetheless, the idea that enhanced fat oxidation (and subsequent conservation of glycogen) dictates the performance benefits of caffeine is pretty incomplete. While some studies have shown caffeine to reduce glycogen utilization during exercise, this finding is somewhat inconsistent. More importantly, this explanation fails to explain how caffeine has (on many occasions) enhanced performance of activities that are not limited by glycogen availability, and does very little to explain how caffeine would enhance performance of high-intensity, short-duration strength and power exercise in which fat oxidation is pretty much negligible during the bout.\n\nSodium/potassium pumps\n\nAnother potential peripheral mechanism pertains to the regulation of sodium and potassium balance within the muscle. Muscle fatigue is complex and multifaceted, but maintaining an appropriate balance of sodium and potassium within the muscle is critical to ensuring that muscle force can be maintained during repeated muscle contractions. Sodium/potassium pumps function to continuously restore balance, but not with perfect efficiency; as such, plasma potassium levels increase as exercise intensity increases. As potassium is increasingly relocated outside of the muscle, resting membrane potential of muscle cells is reduced, which can impair the ability to further complete forceful muscle contractions. Catecholamines and caffeine metabolites have both been shown to directly increase the activity of sodium/potassium pumps, which led researchers to believe that caffeine may improve performance by facilitating the restoration of normal sodium and potassium balance within the exercising muscle. If increased activity of sodium/potassium pumps was a primary mechanism driving caffeine-induced performance improvements, we could reasonably expect to observe that caffeine would lower plasma potassium levels during exercise, this effect would be more pronounced during exercise of higher intensities, and the ergogenic effect of caffeine would similarly be more pronounced during high-intensity exercise.\n\nWhile some studies have shown caffeine to reduce plasma potassium concentrations at rest or during exercise, this effect has been fairly inconsistent and appears to be either similar or lesser in magnitude during high-intensity exercise. Furthermore, the ergogenic effects of caffeine seem to be larger and more reliable during steady-state aerobic exercise in comparison to strength and sprint outcomes of higher relative intensity and shorter duration. Taken together, it seems unlikely that caffeine primarily enhances strength performance by increasing sodium/potassium pump activity.\n\nAdenosine antagonism\n\nThe scientific consensus is moving toward the conclusion that caffeine is mainly enhancing performance outcomes by influencing the CNS. Caffeine has a structure that is very similar to adenosine; so similar, in fact, that it can bind to adenosine’s receptors (Figure 1). This is called competitive antagonism or competitive inhibition, because adenosine’s ability to bind is impeded when caffeine temporarily “steals” its receptors. There are four subtypes of adenosine receptors that are present in various tissues throughout the body, but caffeine’s effects are mostly attributable to its binding to the A1 and A2A adenosine receptors in the brain. Antagonism of adenosine receptors is the primary driver of many of caffeine’s fairly obvious effects: increased heart rate, blood pressure, wakefulness, and alertness. When it comes to exercise, antagonism of adenosine receptors also results in less perceived pain, less perceived exertion, and enhanced maintenance of motor unit firing rates. The result is an improved ability to produce high forces and maintain power output during fatiguing exercise, thus enhancing fatigue resistance in a variety of tasks that include strength and sprint exercise.\n\nFigure 1. The chemical structure of caffeine is quite similar to adenosine, which allows caffeine to bind to adenosine receptors, temporarily offsetting the physiological effects of adenosine.\nMuscle calcium release\n\nWhile adenosine antagonism certainly seems to be the primary driver of caffeine’s performance-enhancing effects, it doesn’t appear to explain everything. A great example of this is a pretty groundbreaking study completed by paraplegic and tetraplegic participants using electrically stimulated muscle contractions for exercise testing. With this model, the researchers were able to evaluate the peripheral response to caffeine ingestion, while minimizing the brain’s influence on motor control and the perception of pain and fatigue. Even under these circumstances, caffeine enhanced muscular endurance by 6%. The authors concluded that some peripheral mechanism must have elicited the observed improvement, speculating that the mechanism might involve calcium transport within the muscle. When muscles receive a signal to contract, the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is the critical step that precedes force production, and diminished calcium release results in diminished force production. As reviewed by McLellan et al, there is some evidence that caffeine can increase sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, thereby enhancing muscle force production and resistance to fatigue during multiple contractions.\n\nIn summary, there are very plausible mechanisms by which caffeine might enhance strength performance. While much of the early caffeine literature focused on catecholamines, fat oxidation, and glycogen sparing, the consensus is that adenosine antagonism is the primary driver of performance enhancement (Figure 2), with some secondary peripheral mechanism(s) that may relate to muscle calcium handling. This is great, because both of those should theoretically translate from aerobic exercise to strength exercise. But do they?\n\nFigure 2. After decades of research, the current scientific consensus is that antagonism of adenosine receptors is the primary mechanism dictating the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine.\nWhat types of exercise performance are improved by caffeine?\nEndurance exercise\n\nCostill and colleagues reported that coffee increased time to exhaustion during cycling (at 80% of VO2max) all the way back in 1978. In the decades since, several more trials have been conducted to evaluate the effects of caffeine on endurance exercise. In recent years, a number of meta-analyses have aggregated the results from these decades of research. If you’re unfamiliar with meta-analyses, they essentially gather up a large number of studies with similar methods and mathematically combine their results. While there are some shortcomings and imperfections, an effectively executed meta-analysis gives us a great summary of the available literature on a topic.\n\nA recent meta-analysis aggregated the results of 44 studies that evaluated the effect of caffeine on time trial performance. Caffeine was found to reduce time to completion by about 2%, with a standardized effect size (Hedges’ G, to be specific) of about 0.28. In “real world” terms, reduced time to completion is like measuring how long it’d take to finish a race, so a reduction is a good thing. Mean power output during time trials was increased by about 3% with caffeine intake, which corresponded with an effect size of 0.22. Notably, the authors pointed out that there seems to be a great deal of variability in caffeine responses, with a handful of studies actually reporting slightly better performance in the placebo condition than the caffeine condition. As noted by Grgic et al, there are actually several meta-analyses out there when it comes to caffeine and endurance exercise. Generally speaking, caffeine enhances endurance performance on a variety of aerobic exercise tasks with reported effect sizes range from 0.2-0.6, which would typically be classified as a small to moderate effect.\n\nStrength and power\n\n“Strength and power” is a pretty broad category that encompasses a wide range of outcomes. In 2018, I helped out with a meta-analysis specifically looking at one-rep max (1RM) strength and vertical jump power. We found that caffeine significantly improved vertical jump power (ES = 0.17) and 1RM strength (ES = 0.20). This finding for jump power mirrors a separate meta-analysis looking at Wingate performance. If you’re not familiar with the Wingate test, it’s a brutal, 30-second cycling test that involves cycling as hard as possible against a fairly high resistance level. If you were to design a test solely for the purpose of making someone vomit from exertion, the Wingate would be that test. Caffeine was found to enhance both peak (ES = 0.27) and mean (ES = 0.18) power output during Wingate sprints, reinforcing the idea that caffeine enhances power-oriented outcomes. When it comes to the strength finding from our meta-analysis of 1RM strength, our results matched up quite well with a meta-analysis from 2010. Their study evaluated the effects of caffeine on maximum voluntary contraction strength, which included the peak force achieved during a single isometric or isokinetic maximal contraction, in addition to 1RM outcomes. They also found caffeine to have a positive effect, with an effect size of 0.19. In comparison to maximal strength, caffeine’s effects on muscular endurance (such as the number of repetitions completed prior to failure) seem to be larger, with a 2016 meta-analysis reporting an effect size of 0.38.\n\nIf you’re interested in taking a very “big picture” look at the caffeine literature, an umbrella review was recently published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. This is basically a review of the meta-analyses in the literature, or a “review of reviews.” As a whole, the caffeine research to date seems to show, fairly conclusively, that caffeine has a larger effect on aerobic endurance exercise in comparison to strength and power outcomes. The effects on muscular endurance are smaller than the effects on aerobic endurance, and the effects on maximal strength and anaerobic power output are even smaller. Nonetheless, caffeine does appear to enhance maximal strength and peak power to a small but statistically significant extent. What we still don’t know, however, is whether or not these acute (single-session) performance improvements from caffeine translate to meaningful strength and hypertrophy gains over time. As far as I know, the only studies looking at long-term training adaptations over several weeks of pre-training caffeine supplementation are studies involving multi-ingredient pre-workout supplements, which are confounded by the presence of several other ingredients that make it impossible to determine caffeine’s independent contribution. Until longer studies are conducted using caffeine in isolation, we simply don’t know. And, as discussed in a later section, the possibility that caffeine’s performance-enhancing effects wear off with repeated use may limit its utility as an everyday training aid.\n\nEffect sizes aren’t necessarily the most intuitive values to interpret on their own, but they allow us to compare different supplements on somewhat equal footing. When it comes to strength and power outcomes, creatine is still in a class of its own. It seems that there is a second “tier” of supplements forming; a group of supplements that exert tangible, meaningful effects that aren’t quite as large as those of creatine. Obviously it depends on the exact exercise task you’re hoping to improve, but this second tier is where we see supplements like beta-alanine, sodium bicarbonate, and possibly (pending further evidence) citrulline malate and dietary nitrate. For high-intensity exercise outcomes, caffeine fits comfortably within this second tier of supplements.\n\nQuick Note: If you’re interested in dialing in your nutrition, check out our app MacroFactor.

Doses less than 3 mg/kg of body mass (such as a morning cup of coffee) can certainly enhance wakefulness and alertness, but they often aren’t enough to get the job done when it comes to enhancing exercise performance. Research showing performance benefits tends to provide doses ranging from 3-6 mg/kg, and most studies tend to stay on the higher end of this range (5-6 mg/kg), just to be safe.\n\nIt’s important to highlight that this ends up being a pretty large dose. If you weigh 100kg (220lb), this means that you’d be given a 600mg caffeine dose in most studies, which is about 6 cups of brewed coffee, all at once.\n\nStudies investigating up to 13 (!) mg/kg of caffeine have reported that the performance benefits seem to peak around 5-6 mg/kg, with no substantial additional benefit observed at higher doses. More importantly, a lot of people get really uncomfortable at doses above the 5-6 mg/kg range. For example, one study found that endurance exercise performance was enhanced by doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, but not with 9 mg/kg. In a different study investigating doses of 3, 6, and 9 mg/kg, the researchers found that 7 out of 10 women ingesting a dose of 9 mg/kg reported adverse effects such as tremors, dizziness, vomiting, and profuse sweating. Taken together, it would appear that doses beyond 6 mg/kg yield no additional performance benefit and might even have a detrimental effect on performance by inducing uncomfortable side effects.\n\nSource\n\nCoffee is cheap, delicious, and accessible all over the place. For these reasons, it’d be fantastic if we could get ergogenic doses of caffeine from an ordinary cup of coffee.\n\nBack in 1998, Graham et al set out to determine if coffee was able to get the job done. Nine subjects completed the study, in which endurance exercise (running to exhaustion at 85% of VO2max) was tested after ingestion of various test treatments. The treatments included:\n\nPlacebo capsule + water\nCaffeine capsule + water\nRegular coffee\nDecaffeinated coffee\nDecaffeinated coffee + caffeine capsule\n\nAll treatments included 7.15 ml/kg of fluid, and caffeinated treatments all provided 4.45 mg/kg of caffeine.\n\nResults of the study were quite surprising. Participants had significant performance improvements when they consumed water + caffeine capsules, but not when they consumed any other treatment. This means that caffeine’s benefits were somehow blunted when consumed as normal coffee, and even when the very same caffeine capsules were consumed with decaffeinated coffee. The authors hypothesized that some component of coffee, such as chlorogenic acid, interfered with the performance-enhancing benefit of caffeine.  \n\nThis outcome was largely taken at face value for about 10-15 years after its publication, and notable review papers concluded that caffeine anhydrous, consumed in powder or capsule form, was more ergogenic than coffee. However, this result is a bit difficult to swallow. For example, why would Costill’s classic 1978 paper document performance-enhancing benefits of caffeine, given that their caffeine source was actually coffee?\n\nReplication is a key, foundational principle of science, especially in fields in which small samples are common. Consider the following scenario: I flip a coin 10 times, and each flip can yield “heads” or “tails.” Theoretically, I should get 5 of each. But if I got 3 heads and 7 tails, that would be far from impossible, and not even particularly improbable. Obviously, no one would walk away from that experiment concluding that you have a 30% chance of getting “heads” when you flip a fair two-sided coin. We need to replicate that finding by doing another set of 10, and another, and another. If you get to 10,000 flips and find that you only got 3,000 heads, it’s a virtual certainty that there’s something strange going on with that coin. Small-sample research should be viewed with the same level of skepticism until a decent number of studies have been conducted.\n\nHodgson et al directly compared caffeine anhydrous to coffee in the context of endurance performance in 2013, and my lab did a similar comparison in the context of strength and sprint performance in 2016. In both cases, caffeine anhydrous and coffee appeared to affect exercise outcomes in a similar manner. Also in 2016, Richardson et al showed that both coffee and decaffeinated coffee + caffeine anhydrous are capable of enhancing resistance exercise performance. Taken together, the current literature suggests that coffee exerts similar effects on performance as caffeine anhydrous, and coffee can therefore be considered a perfectly suitable source of caffeine for performance enhancement. There is, however, a big challenge when making coffee your caffeine source of choice: the caffeine content of brewed coffee is highly variable. Obviously caffeine content will vary based on the exact coffee bean, roast type, and preparation method, but seemingly thorough attempts to account for these factors can still result in an uncertain caffeine dose. Researchers conducting one study (Figure 3) purchased the same brewed coffee product at the same store for six days in a row, and found that the caffeine content ranged from 259mg to 564mg per dose!   \n\nFigure 3. Measured caffeine content of the same coffee product, purchased from the same store, on six consecutive days. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14607010\n\nIt’s worth noting that caffeine capsules and coffee are far from the only potential sources of caffeine (for a list of some common caffeine sources, see Table 1). As reviewed in a textbook chapter I helped write a few years ago, there have been a few studies looking at various absorption rates with different types of caffeine sources. Generally speaking, there’s not a meaningful difference when it comes to how rapidly blood caffeine levels are increased in response to coffee, tea, soft drinks, energy drinks, caffeine capsules, or caffeine powder when equivalent caffeine doses are orally ingested. Any differences in absorption rates between these sources are small in magnitude and likely related to differences in the pH, volume, and concentration of fluid consumed. The one exception would be caffeinated gum; caffeine can be absorbed (to some extent) through the oral mucosa, so caffeinated gum increases blood caffeine levels more rapidly than regular oral ingestion of a caffeinated product. That’s not particularly important, it just means you wouldn’t have to wait as long for caffeinated gum’s effects to kick in. Speaking of which, how long should you be waiting?\n\nTiming\n\nCaffeine has pretty high bioavailability; around 99% of orally ingested caffeine is absorbed within 45 minutes of ingestion, and less than 2% of orally ingested caffeine is excreted in the urine in an unchanged form. In the process of caffeine metabolism, it is broken down into three primary metabolites: paraxanthine (80%), theobromine (11%), and theophylline (5%), with the remainder of caffeine being broken down into a number of less plentiful metabolites. The majority (about 95%) of caffeine metabolism is dictated by the CYP1A2 enzyme, which is part of the liver’s cytochrome P450 enzyme system. After oral caffeine ingestion, substantial increases in blood caffeine concentrations are observed within 15 minutes, and peak values are typically reached within about 30-60 minutes. However, it could take up to 2 hours in some cases, as the rate of gastric emptying and the presence of other nutrients can certainly affect the rate of caffeine appearance in the blood. If caffeine is ingested as gum, the absorption rate is about 30-50% faster, give or take. The half-life of caffeine (the time required to clear half of the dose from your bloodstream) is generally estimated to be around 3-6 hours, but singular studies have suggested that the number may be as low as 2 hours or as high as 12 hours.\n\nClearly, there is a great deal of variability when it comes to the rate at which caffeine is metabolized. The CYP1A2 enzyme is largely responsible for caffeine metabolism, and up to 72.5% of the variability in CYP1A2 enzyme activity is determined genetically. We all get our alleles for the CYP1A2 gene from our biological parents, and we’ve got three options: we could get two copies of the “A” allele, two copies of the “C” allele, or one of each. People with the “AA” arrangement are considered fast metabolizers, while individuals with “AC” or “CC” genotypes are considered slow metabolizers.\n\nWhile CYP1A2 genotype certainly helps explain some of the variability in observed half-lives, it might also explain some of the variability in performance. While the science is far from settled, a recent study found that caffeine had an ergogenic effect in “AA” participants, no benefit for “AC” participants, and caffeine actually made endurance performance worse in the “CC” participants. It has been hypothesized that caffeine’s metabolites might make a meaningful contribution to the ergogenic effect of caffeine; as such, differing rates of caffeine metabolism could alter the rate at which metabolites accumulate, thereby altering the likelihood of observing an ergogenic effect. Such a hypothesis could possibly mean that slow metabolizers may simply need different dosing or timing recommendations to obtain performance benefits, but there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive conclusion at this time.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, there is a high likelihood that caffeine responses are mediated, to some extent, by variations in other genes. Some likely candidates include the ADORA2A gene, which codes for the adenosine A2A receptor, and a variety of genes that code for proteins involved with multiple neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Rate of caffeine metabolism is also influenced by several factors other than genotype. To varying degrees, CYP1A2 enzyme activity can be influenced by sex, estrogen level, menstrual cycle phase, oral contraceptive use, body composition, alcohol, flavonoids, grapefruit juice, numerous vegetables, charred meat, smoking, and a wide variety of prescription and over-the-counter drugs.\n\nTaken together, the evidence would collectively suggest that caffeine should be consumed 30-90 minutes before exercise if you’re hoping to receive an ergogenic benefit. Generally speaking, 45-60 minutes before exercise offers a more specific recommendation that is usually fine for most circumstances. However, as discussed in this section, there can be a great deal of variability in the rate at which caffeine is metabolized, which has implications for the timing of caffeine dosing.\n\nSynergistic ingredients\n\nWhile on the topic of how to use caffeine, there are a few notable ingredients that appear to pair very well with caffeine. While we already know that epinephrine and norepinephrine tend to increase in response to caffeine ingestion, resulting in increased arousal and alertness, dopamine is another catecholamine that is often overlooked in the exercise science literature. Dopamine appears to play an important role in many of caffeine’s cognitive effects. There are antagonistic interactions between adenosine and dopamine; by antagonizing adenosine receptors, caffeine may therefore enhance dopamine release and/or dopaminergic neurotransmission. This is important because L-tyrosine is a building block from which dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine are formed. Tyrosine is known to have some cognitive effects of its own, with some studies showing positive effects on memory, cognitive performance, perceived stress, and subjective well-being when exposed to acute stressors.\n\nWhile L-tyrosine will not necessarily increase resting catecholamine production, it appears to exert its favorable cognitive effects by attenuating acute, stress-induced depletion of catecholamines. There isn’t much research directly assessing the combination of caffeine and L-tyrosine; while combination with L-tyrosine is unlikely to do much for exercise performance, it’s probably not a terrible idea to ensure that you have a nice reserve of the building blocks for catecholamine production present, especially if you’re primarily using caffeine to enhance alertness and cognitive function. Much of the L-tyrosine research uses fairly high doses, often around 150 mg/kg of body weight, when evaluating the effects of L-tyrosine alone. While there isn’t much research to make conclusions about adequate dosing when used as a supplement to support caffeine’s effects, I would speculate that much lower doses are sufficient, and I usually take around 1-2g when using caffeine.\n\nL-theanine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid found primarily in green tea. When evaluating L-theanine on its own, some studies have documented positive effects on relaxation, anxiety, attention, and sleep quality. The cool thing about L-theanine is that its effects are remarkably complementary to some of caffeine’s “downsides.” Some people note that caffeine makes them a bit anxious, jittery, or too “amped up” to focus and perform well on cognitive tasks, and the potential for caffeine to disrupt sleep is well-documented. L-theanine can help attenuate some of these unfavorable responses to caffeine and can induce relaxation without sedation, meaning the L-theanine won’t counteract the intended effect of caffeine by making you tired. There are multiple human studies demonstrating that a combination of theanine and caffeine resulted in improvements in cognitive function and mood, and a rodent study found that theanine partially attenuated sleep disturbances caused by caffeine. Generally speaking, human studies combining theanine with caffeine tend to use theanine doses of around 100-200mg.\n\nA third supplement that is sometimes combined with caffeine is theacrine, not to be confused with theanine, despite the similar spelling. Theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid) is a purine alkaloid found in a very specific type of tea, and its structure is quite similar to that of caffeine (Figure 4). As a result, it appears to antagonize adenosine receptors and work through similar mechanisms of action. Studies investigating theacrine alone have documented effects like those observed with caffeine, such as perceived energy, focus, and concentration. A recent study evaluated both physical and cognitive performance using theacrine, caffeine, or a combination of both compared to placebo. All three treatments showed a trend for enhanced endurance performance compared to placebo, and both caffeine and caffeine + theacrine improved some indices of cognitive performance.\n\nFigure 4. Due to structural similarities with caffeine, theacrine has been shown to antagonize adenosine receptors and exert some similar physiological effects.\n\nA cool thing about theacrine is that one study found that its effects didn’t seem to fade after 8 weeks of daily use; as discussed in the next section of this article, the same can’t be said for caffeine. Theacrine takes a slightly longer time to reach peak blood values when compared to caffeine (approximately 2 hours), and caffeine appears to enhance the bioavailability of theacrine when they are consumed together, whereas theacrine does not meaningfully influence caffeine pharmacokinetics. Theacrine has a substantially longer half-life than caffeine, with estimates ranging from 16.5-26.1 hours in one study (depending on the dose). Personally, I wish caffeine had a shorter half-life, so I don’t necessarily view a longer half-life as an unequivocally positive thing. On the bright side, it could potentially extend the period of time in which cognitive and/or physical performance are enhanced. But, for a stimulant, you could argue that the ideal scenario would be that you use it, you become alert for a set period of time, and then the stimulant quickly clears your system so you can get some sleep.\n\nOne of the downsides of caffeine is that you run the risk of disrupting sleep quality if you use it late in the day, as the half-life is generally around 3-6 hours. While a study found that 8 weeks of daily theacrine supplementation was not associated with any major safety concerns, they noted that self-perceived vigor was reduced at the 4-week time point. Given the long half-life of theacrine, I’d be interested to see more research evaluating the effects of theacrine on sleep quality, even when theacrine is consumed fairly early in the day. In addition, the authors of the paper noted that theacrine may have sleep-promoting effects at lower doses, as opposed to the wakefulness-promoting effects observed with higher doses. To make matters more uncertain, a rodent study found that theacrine paradoxically improved parameters of sleep quality and attenuated caffeine’s insomnia-inducing effect. Hopefully some human studies assessing theacrine’s effects on sleep duration and quality will be forthcoming; until that happens, it’s hard to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nFor now, there is reasonably strong theory to support the idea of combining L-tyrosine with caffeine, but more research is needed to confirm that this theory checks out in the real world. When it comes to L-theanine, there is some good human evidence demonstrating that it complements caffeine quite nicely. If you’re interested in some further reading on the topic, Ian McCarthy has written some informative lay press articles about stacking theanine and tyrosine with caffeine. There is emerging research suggesting that theacrine exerts effects similar to caffeine, albeit with a longer time to peak blood values and a longer half-life. The research also suggests that theacrine does not interfere with the effects of caffeine when they are combined and might be slightly more effective than caffeine alone, but more evidence is needed to conclusively show that theacrine actually provides additive, synergistic effects.\n\nDo the effects of caffeine wear off over time?\n\nIf you’re a regular caffeine user, it’s quite apparent that some degree of habituation occurs. With consistent, repeated use, our bodies develop a tolerance to some of caffeine’s effects. There are a few mechanisms that likely contribute to this tolerance. As previously discussed, many of caffeine’s effects are primarily caused by caffeine blocking adenosine receptors; some rodent research has suggested that chronic caffeine use increases the number of adenosine receptors, thereby attenuating the magnitude of caffeine’s effects. There are also epigenetic changes that occur with repeated caffeine consumption. An epigenetic change refers to a change in gene function, without a change in the genetic code; you can think of it like using dimmer switches to turn the activity of different genes up and down. The epigenetic changes accompanying habitual caffeine use are likely to alter caffeine metabolism and clearance by influencing the activity of CYP1A2 (and other cytochrome P450 system genes), and likely to alter the response to caffeine by influencing genes in the dopaminergic and adenosine pathways. It’s pretty clear that certain responses to caffeine, such as effects on heart rate, blood pressure, alertness, and physiological arousal, are prone to the development of tolerance. But, do we become tolerant of caffeine’s ergogenic effects as well?\n\nThis question has been the focus of multiple research papers in recent years. For an in-depth discussion of this topic, be sure to check out Greg’s article in Volume 3, Issue 4 of Monthly Applications in Strength Sport (MASS). A lot of previous studies have addressed this question in a fairly indirect manner by grouping participants by habitual caffeine use based on their self-reported habits, then determining if caffeine was less effective for people who habitually consume it. These approaches have yielded mixed results, with some studies providing apparent evidence of tolerance formation, and others showing no signs of tolerance. More recently, a couple of studies have taken a more direct approach to this question by actually giving caffeine doses consistently over the course of 3-4 weeks. While the studies didn’t measure outcomes that the typical bodybuilder, powerlifter, or weightlifter would be most interested in, the results are informative nonetheless.\n\nIn one such study, caffeine’s effects on endurance cycling performance were diminished following 28 days of 1.5-3 mg/kg per day of caffeine ingestion, while a group consuming a daily placebo still enjoyed a performance-enhancing benefit from caffeine after the 4-week supplementation period. In another study, the effects of caffeine on both aerobic and anaerobic performance were consistently tracked over a 20-day period. Not all performance outcomes followed the exact same time course of habituation, but results generally suggested that caffeine’s ergogenic effects had faded a bit throughout the study (Figure 5). As discussed previously, this could potentially mean that the acute performance boost from caffeine may not persist when used as a daily training aid, which would reduce the likelihood that results from single-dose caffeine studies directly translate to enhanced training adaptations over time. As a result, caffeine may need to be used fairly strategically to translate acute performance boosts into long-term training adaptations. While this story is far from over, and more studies should be carried out to evaluate habituation effects using a variety of performance outcomes, supplementation durations, and caffeine doses, I agree with Greg’s conclusion: For now, it would be prudent to allocate your caffeine use thoughtfully if you’re interested in maximizing its ergogenic benefit. Such an approach would involve using caffeine only for your most important workouts or athletic events, or periodically taking some time away from caffeine (at least a couple of weeks, most likely) to resensitize your response before fully maximizing its performance-enhancing benefits.\n\nFigure 5. As shown in this figure from Greg’s article in Volume 3, Issue 4 of Monthly Applications in Strength Sport (MASS), there is evidence suggesting that the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine may decrease with repeated use. Original study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343867/\n\nWhen it comes to taking time away from caffeine, be sure to account for withdrawal. If you are a regular caffeine user and you abruptly stop using it, withdrawal symptoms will likely appear within 12-24 hours and reach peak intensity within about 20-48 hours. Symptoms typically include headache, drowsiness, fatigue, and irritability. It’s safe to assume that your athletic performance might take a slight hit during the peak of withdrawal symptoms, so it’d be wise to carefully decide the time at which you plan to cease caffeine use.\n\nCommon concerns\nCardiovascular health\n\nThe idea that caffeine is bad for the heart is a fairly pervasive misconception, which is probably fueled by two main drivers. First of all, a large dose of caffeine causes noticeable, acute changes in heart rate and blood pressure, especially for people who don’t regularly consume it. Intuitively, that might be perceived as an effect with eventual consequences. In addition, some early epidemiological studies reported links between coffee and cardiovascular disease, but many of these early studies failed to adequately account for the fact that coffee consumption is quite highly correlated with smoking.\n\nNow, it’s worth noting that coffee and caffeine aren’t exactly the same thing. However, when you want to assess the long-term health effects of something, your best bet is to check the epidemiology literature. Unfortunately for us, there aren’t huge data sets looking at the effects of regular consumption of pre-workout supplements or caffeine capsules in tens of thousands of people over several decades. So, given the widespread use of coffee throughout the entire planet, the coffee literature is our best tool for assessing cardiovascular risk with long-term caffeine consumption. In studies that adequately control for smoking and other important factors, coffee consumption has not been associated with substantial increases in cardiovascular disease risk. In fact, studies generally tend to show that “moderate” coffee intake, often defined as somewhere between 1-5 cups per day, is actually associated with a reduction in risk. Beyond this intake, studies generally show that the health benefits disappear, but cardiovascular risk doesn’t seem to be meaningfully elevated when coffee intake is kept within fairly reasonable ranges.   \n\nAs previously discussed, CYP1A2 genotype might influence the performance effects of caffeine by influencing the rate of caffeine metabolism. Similarly, authors have investigated the possibility that CYP1A2 genotype might influence caffeine’s effects on health-related outcomes. A 2006 paper found that coffee intake was associated with heart attack risk in slow metabolizers, but not in fast metabolizers. Similarly, a 2009 paper found that coffee intake was associated with hypertension risk in slow metabolizers, but not in fast metabolizers. While very preliminary research has suggested that the slow metabolizers are out of luck when it comes to cardiovascular outcomes and performance enhancement, there is one study suggesting that high caffeine intake is associated with lower bone density in elderly adults – but only in fast metabolizers. Nonetheless, it’s really important to note that all of these links between genotype and various health and performance outcomes are extremely preliminary in nature. For example, a recent (and very large) study found that moderate coffee consumption was associated with a protective effect for cardiovascular disease, whereas heavy (>6 cups per day) consumption was associated with a modest negative effect, and effects were not influenced by CYP1A2 genotype to a meaningful degree. To make matters a bit more complicated, the inconvenient truth of the matter is that caffeine metabolism is likely affected, to some extent, by several genes. As such, we are probably just scratching the surface when it comes to determining how our genes influence our body’s individualized response to caffeine intake.\n\nFor now, the most justifiable conclusion is that caffeine, consumed in coffee or tea, is unlikely to have devastating effects when it comes to cardiovascular health. It’s possible that some deleterious effects might be observed if you have particularly high caffeine intake (the equivalent of >6 cups of coffee per day, which is about 600 mg) or are a slow caffeine metabolizer, and we can’t rule out the possibility that effects are different if your primary caffeine source is something other than coffee or tea. Having said that, caffeine is not entirely benign in all contexts. Research suggests that high caffeine intake should probably be avoided by pregnant women, people with hypertension, elderly individuals at high risk for bone fracture, and anyone taking one of the many medications that are known to interact with caffeine. In addition, some people are particularly sensitive to caffeine and tend to be more susceptible to feeling jittery, anxious, or unable to sleep when moderate to large doses of caffeine are ingested. The acute lethal dose of caffeine is estimated to be around 10 grams (10,000 mg), but there’s no reason that anyone should ever be near that value, and it’d be unwise to approach it due to the well-known variability in caffeine metabolism between individuals. For example, there have been reports of fatalities from doses of 6.5 grams and lower, whereas a couple of college students were accidentally given 30 gram doses and (barely) survived, thanks to intensive care and dialysis. Generally speaking, research papers assessing the safety of caffeine tend to suggest that healthy adults ought to limit their daily caffeine to no more than roughly 400-600 mg/day, depending on body size.\n\nVasoconstriction/vasodilation\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of the cardiovascular system, caffeine’s effects on blood vessels should be mentioned. Caffeine is an adenosine antagonist, and adenosine is known to have some vasodilatory effects, meaning it causes blood vessels to dilate and accommodate greater blood flow. From an exercise perspective, this sounds a bit problematic. Vigorous exercise requires that we deliver oxygen and energy substrates to the working muscle, and also demands that we have sufficient blood flow to clear out any localized accumulation of metabolites associated with fatigue. In fact, as discussed in a previous Stronger By Science article, many individuals supplement with nitric oxide precursors as a means of increasing blood flow during exercise. While one might intuitively assume that caffeine would therefore induce some blood vessel constriction that would be disadvantageous for exercise, the picture is (fortunately) a bit more complicated than that.\n\nAs highlighted in a 2010 review paper, caffeine affects the dilation and constriction of blood vessels in numerous, and sometimes conflicting, ways. Caffeine has both direct and indirect effects on a variety of physiological stimuli for both constriction and dilation of blood vessels, including adenosine, inositol triphosphate, and nitric oxide. The vascular effects of caffeine and adenosine both vary as a function of tissue type and duration of exposure. For example, adenosine induces vasodilation via A2A receptors in the coronary vasculature, but causes vasoconstriction via the A1 receptors in the pulmonary arteries and afferent arterioles of the kidneys. The overall vascular response to caffeine depends upon cellular events affecting the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, kidneys, endothelial cells, and the smooth muscle cells that line blood vessel walls. Taken together, the authors of the review note that caffeine typically causes a mild and temporary constriction of blood vessels, but they primarily characterize caffeine as a vasodilator. This makes sense, given the fact that multi-ingredient pre-workout supplements containing caffeine have been shown to induce pretty substantial increases in blood flow. Obviously, such supplements contain other ingredients known to promote blood flow, but these findings suggest that any vasoconstriction induced by caffeine is not nearly robust enough to overpower contradictory signals that call for vasodilation. Blood flow is of paramount importance during exercise, so there are very powerful and redundant signals to ensure that blood flow is increased during exercise, with or without the addition of nitric oxide boosters. So, concerns about caffeine hindering a workout or ruining a “pump” by causing a meaningful degree of vasoconstriction seem to be pretty unfounded.\n\nDehydration\n\nA common concern about caffeine is that it will actively contribute to dehydration. In reality, this concern is way overblown, for a couple of reasons.\n\nIt is certainly true that caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, meaning it increases urine output (and, therefore, fluid loss). However, the most common methods of ingesting large caffeine doses also involve fluid ingestion, such as drinking a cup of coffee or an energy drink. So, while a cup of coffee may slightly increase urine output, it also provides several ounces of water, and therefore has a net positive effect for hydration status. A 2016 study evaluated the hydrating effect of several beverages by monitoring fluid balance in the 4 hours following ingestion. The beverage hydration index of caffeinated coffee was lower than plain water, but not by much, and certainly not by a large enough magnitude to be concerned about. In addition, humans develop a tolerance to the diuretic effect of caffeine, to the extent that it becomes even more negligible in people who consume caffeine regularly.\n\nSleep\n\nGiven that caffeine clearly has a stimulant effect that promotes wakefulness, it’s quite intuitive to assume that caffeine consumption late at night could interfere with sleep. A study from 2013 evaluated the effects of caffeine intake (400mg) consumed 0, 3, or 6 hours before bed on various indices of sleep quality. Compared to a placebo, all three times of caffeine ingestion increased sleep disturbance and negatively impacted sleep quality. The important conclusion to draw from this study is not that you will avoid sleep disturbance by restricting caffeine within 6 hours of bed. This study tells us that consuming caffeine within 6 hours of bedtime is likely to disrupt your sleep, but it doesn’t tell us how long we actually have to abstain from caffeine to avoid sleep issues. It’s possible that you could avoid sleep disruption if the final dose is 7 hours before bed, 10 hours, 14 hours, or 24 hours. Frankly, it’s impossible to tell based on this study. The results suggest that the number is greater than 6 hours, but we can’t be certain how much greater. Realistically, the exact time of caffeine abstention needed prior to bedtime probably depends on the dose of caffeine, your habitual caffeine intake, how rapidly you metabolize caffeine, and how sensitive you are to the stimulatory effects of caffeine. As such, anyone with sleep issues should consider whether or not their caffeine intake habits might be contributing to their sleep disruption, even if they stop consuming caffeine fairly early in the afternoon.\n\nPossible health benefits\n\nWhile much attention has been devoted to potential adverse health effects of caffeine, it’s important to note that there are numerous health benefits associated with both caffeinated beverages (such as coffee and tea) and even caffeine itself. Both coffee and tea are loaded with antioxidants and other bioactive compounds, and decades of research suggests that regular moderate consumption of coffee and/or tea is associated with positive, protective health outcomes. Consumption of these beverages has been associated with reduced risk of mortality, certain cancers, liver conditions, depression, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and other components of metabolic syndrome. As we’ve seen in some recent research, more antioxidants aren’t always better, and high-dose antioxidant supplementation has been shown to blunt adaptations to training. While the research has yet to identify an exact “dose” of antioxidant that would warrant concern regarding blunted training adaptations, the total amount of antioxidants provided by coffee and other whole food sources are substantially lower than the doses used in antioxidant supplementation studies, and the current consensus is that antioxidants obtained from non-supplementary diet sources are unlikely to counteract training adaptations.\n\nThere’s also some literature suggesting that regular consumption of caffeine is associated with lower risk of developing certain neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. The evidence for a reduction in Parkinson’s risk is a bit stronger than for Alzheimer’s, as the Alzheimer’s literature is fairly inconsistent. Interestingly, caffeine’s apparent reduction of Parkinson’s risk seems to be influenced by estrogen, with more pronounced effects observed in males and females who have never used post-menopausal hormone replacement. For now, there’s insufficient evidence to determine whether or not caffeine might play a role in slowing the progression of certain neurodegenerative diseases after diagnosis. In the case of Parkinson’s, there are numerous animal studies that detail some extremely plausible mechanisms by which habitual caffeine use could alleviate symptoms and slow down disease progression, but the limited number of human trials to date don’t paint a consistent picture from which to draw definitive conclusions. Oddly enough, one study found that caffeine did not significantly influence the rate of Parkinson’s disease progression, but the researchers observed faster progression of Parkinson’s disease among high caffeine consumers that also habitually used creatine. Given that this is just a single study and the authors are unable to identify a plausible mechanism underlying this observation, I file this finding under “interesting but unverified” for now.\n\nIn summary, caffeine was once widely perceived to have negative impacts on health, but this negative reputation has turned around significantly in the past couple of decades. It would appear that regular consumption of moderate caffeine doses, most commonly consumed as coffee or tea, has a neutral to positive effect on a wide range of health outcomes.\n\nSummary\nAcute caffeine supplementation has a bigger effect on aerobic endurance performance than strength performance, but it still improves strength endurance and, to a lesser extent, maximal strength and power. There currently isn’t enough research to determine if these acute performance improvements translate to meaningful strength or hypertrophy gains over time.\nMost studies showing ergogenic effects use doses of 3-6 mg/kg of body mass, consumed about an hour before exercise.\nThe performance benefits of caffeine seem to diminish (to some extent) over time, and it’s safe to assume that performance dips when a habitual caffeine user is experiencing caffeine withdrawal symptoms.\nThere’s some justification that co-ingestion of L-tyrosine and L-theanine may support some of the more cognitively-oriented effects of caffeine ingestion, but more research is needed.\nThe common health concerns pertaining to caffeine are fairly exaggerated within normal ranges of dosing (below 400-600 mg per day), and regular consumption of tea and coffee within this range are associated with neutral to positive effects on a wide range of health outcomes.\nDue to its fairly long half-life, it’d be a good idea to limit caffeine consumption late in the afternoon or evening.\nGenetic differences may impact the health and performance effects of caffeine. Key genes include CYP1A2 and ADORA2A, but many others are likely to play a limited role. This body of research is too small to draw definitive conclusions, but there is no doubt that caffeine’s performance benefits vary widely between individuals.\n\n[feature_box style=”3″ only_advanced=”There%20are%20no%20title%20options%20for%20the%20choosen%20style” alignment=”center”]\n\n\nSupplement this article with the podcast episode on the topic.\n\nWant to hear Eric and Greg discuss the key takeaways from the caffeine literature?

    "content": "Research Spotlight: Does protein timing matter?\nby Eric Trexler\nAugust 8, 2020\nResearch Spotlight articles share concise breakdowns of interesting studies. The study reviewed is \"Protein timing has no effect on lean mass, strength and functional capacity gains induced by resistance exercise in postmenopausal women: A randomized clinical trial\" by Flávia M S de Branco et al.\n\nThe “anabolic window” concept suggests that protein should be consumed immediately post-workout to enhance strength and hypertrophy, but this concept has been questioned in recent years. This study evaluated the effect of protein timing on lean body mass and strength improvements in untrained, post-menopausal women.\n\n34 women were assigned to either a protein-carb group (30g protein post-workout, then 30g carbs ~6 hrs later in the day) or a carb-protein group (30g carbs post-workout, then 30g protein ~6hrs later). Total daily protein was similar for both groups (~0.9-1 g/kg/day, plus the supplement), with minimal dietary protein (aside from the assigned supplementation) in the hours before and after training sessions. The subjects participated in a full-body training program 3x/week throughout the 8-week study.\n\nBoth groups had similar increases in strength (1RM bench press and leg extension) and lean mass. This study suggests that consuming protein immediately after a workout may not promote additional benefits for lean mass or strength gains. Intuitively, this makes sense; muscle protein synthesis is elevated for 24-72 hours after resistance training, so the exact timing of protein feedings in proximity to the lifting bout probably isn’t absolutely critical.\n\nHaving said that, there is a limit to which we can stimulate protein synthesis in a single meal, and protein synthesis is transiently elevated in response to feeding before returning to baseline. It’s advisable to have at least three separate protein boluses of ≥0.24 g/kg of protein throughout the day. If you’re interested in minimizing the likelihood of leaving any gains on the table, it’d also be a decent idea to place your workout somewhere between two of those protein boluses, and to separate the pre-workout and post-workout protein servings by no more than 4-6 hours.\n\nThe bottom line: Ultimately, there’s no real downside to getting some protein in around your workouts. However, multiple studies have suggested that total daily protein intake and distribution are more important than peri-workout protein timing when it comes to strength and lean mass gains.\n\nGet these newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe Stronger By Science weekly newsletter features practical training tips and summaries of the latest research.

    "content": "Research Spotlight: The effect of weekly set volume on strength gain\nby Greg Nuckols\nMarch 6, 2021\nResearch Spotlight articles share concise breakdowns of interesting studies. The study reviewed is \"The Effect of Weekly Set Volume on Strength Gain: A Meta-Analysis\" by Ralston et al.\n\nThere’s always a lot of chatter about the effects of training volume on muscle growth, but the impact of training volume on strength gains is often overlooked. A 2017 meta-analysis by Ralston and colleagues analyzed the extant literature, comparing the effects of low (5 or fewer working sets per exercise per week) versus moderate-to-high (6-10+ sets per week) training volumes on strength gains.\n\nThey found that higher volumes led to larger strength gains, but the effect was pretty small (effect size of 0.18). In practical terms, it means that doing, say, 10 hard sets of squats per week instead of 5 may increase your rate of strength gains by 20-25%. To the researchers’ credit, they also did several sub-analyses and robustness checks (looking at the effects on just multi-joint exercises or just single joint exercises, etc.), and found that the effect estimate stayed within a fairly tight range (from 0.14-0.23), suggesting that, while the effect is small, it’s pretty reliable.\n\nA logical question that follows is, “Why is the relative effect of volume on muscle growth so much larger than the effect on strength?” I think the answer is pretty straightforward. While higher training volumes tend to produce more muscle growth, plenty of other factors contribute to strength gains (namely, improved motor skills, especially with heavy loads). The studies in this meta-analysis were equated for intensity, which is a much larger drive of strength gains, at least over the short-to-moderate term.\n\nAs training status increases, I suspect that the importance of hypertrophy for continued strength gains increases (as your cushion to improve maximal strength via technique and skill improvements gets smaller), which would mean that the impact of training volume would get larger, but that’s just speculation on my part. That’s not what this meta-analysis was testing.\n\nIf you want to read more on the subject, we covered this meta-analysis in more depth in Volume 1, Issue 6 of MASS.\n\nGet these newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe Stronger By Science weekly newsletter features practical training tips and summaries of the latest research.

    "title": "Training to Failure, or Just Training to Fail?",
    "content": "Training to Failure, or Just Training to Fail?\nby Dan Ogborn\nArticles, Programming\nWhat you’re getting yourself into\n\n~3300 words, 11-22 minute read time\n\nKey Points\n\n1. When comparing a WIDE array of training variables (number of reps, rest periods, rep speed, and loading), muscle growth is the same if sets are taken to failure.\n\n2. Training to failure is likely safe.  Or, at the very least, there’s no direct evidence that it’s particularly dangerous.\n\n3. Training to complete failure likely isn’t necessary to maximize growth – you can likely leave a couple reps in the tank.  Unfortunately, people aren’t very good at knowing how close to failure they actually are.  Taking a set to failure “idiot-proofs” it to make sure you maximized the stimulus.\n\n4. The bottom line is that training to failure helps make sure you’re actually working hard enough for your muscles to grow, as far as we can tell it’s safe, but it’s neither necessary nor a magic bullet.\n\n \n\nNote from Greg: Dan Ogborn’s isn’t a name too many people are familiar with, and that’s a crying shame.  He has a PhD in Medical Sciences specializing in the molecular effects of strength training in muscle, he’s worked as a post-doctoral fellow in muscle physiology, and he’s finishing up his course work to become a physical therapist.  Consequently, it’s not too surprising that he hasn’t had the time to write a ton and work on growing an audience, so he’s been flying under the radar.  I’m really honored that he found the time in his schedule to write this article for Strengtheory.  I’ve been a fan of Dan’s work since 2012, and this article is exactly what I’ve come to expect from him – well-researched but still very relatable and applicable.\n\nA new perspective on training to failure for muscle hypertrophy\n\nFailure: the proverbial “F” word of the training industry. Failure is heralded as the ticket to slabs of muscle by some, and to others, the unmanageable training stimulus sure to end in injury. We’re in the midst of the hypertrophy renaissance period, in which the strictly defined hypertrophy training parameters of days past are no more. It’s probably worth looking at the role that failure played in shaping these studies, and more importantly, revisiting the concept as a component of a hypertrophy training program.\n\nTraining to failure across the hypertrophy literature\n\nMany in the training community have abandoned the practice of training to failure, while others still embrace it. It’s far from a forgotten concept, as many recent training studies used failure as a means to equate experimental conditions (1-3).\n\nMuch of the work demonstrating the comparable growth that occurs with both low and high-load training used failure as an endpoint (1,2,4), findings that we’ve recently replicated in trained individuals (3). We can’t be certain that concentric failure is entirely responsible for the observed response; however, comparisons of low-intensity training (30%-1RM) matched to high-intensity training (90%-1RM) to failure have shown a complete lack of an acute protein synthetic response for low-intensity training. When the low-intensity condition was taken to concentric failure, a comparable acute protein synthetic response was observed (5). The acute protein synthetic response may not predict the chronic adaptations to training (6), yet it’s still interesting that low-intensity training short of failure (work-matched to high-intensity training to failure) doesn’t seem to stimulate an acute protein synthetic response.\n\nFor tempo, my recent meta-analyses with Brad Schoenfeld and James Kreiger demonstrated that repetition durations between 0.5-10 seconds have comparable growth when considering only studies using concentric failure (7).\n\nA comparable analysis doesn’t exist for rest intervals; however, a closer look at Menno Henselman’s and Brad Schoenfeld’s recent review yields similar findings (8). While lacking quantitative analysis, they came to a similar conclusion regarding the various rest intervals that can be used to promote growth. They didn’t group studies based on the use of failure as an end-point, but much of their narrative analyses on long-term hypertrophy was formulated from five studies (4, 9-12). Of those, the use of failure was either clearly indicated (4, 9), mentioned in the discussion (10), or wasn’t clearly stated at all (repetition maximum ranges) (11, 12). In all five of those cases, rest intervals from 1-5 minutes did not have a profound effect on the hypertrophic response to training (4, 9, 10), with the exception of Souza-Junior et al (12) favoring decreased rest intervals.\n\nWhile existing evidence (1-4, 7-11) indicates a wide array of parameters that we can use in our training programs to promote growth when training to concentric failure, it doesn’t validate the assertion that training to failure is required, or enhances growth over other training conditions.\n\nFailure means flexibility, but what about results?\n\nDespite the fact that training to failure has been a prominent and unsettled debate in the training industry for decades, there’s remarkably few direct comparisons to determine its relevance to training adaptations (13, 14). What’s surprising is that there is a particular lack of literature on hypertrophy, and most of what exists focuses on strength (15-18). As far as hypertrophy is concerned, much is focused on fluctuations in hormone levels (18-21), used as a proxy for growth down the road. Given that recent work demonstrates that acute fluctuations in certain hormones don’t actually correlate with the long-term growth response, using arguments on hormonal fluctuations that occur when training to failure may not be a sound idea (22, 23).\n\nRecent evidence suggests that failure may not be necessary as far as hypertrophy is concerned (14). Sampson et al (14) blocked-randomized 28 males following a four-week training familiarization period (50-80% 1RM, 2:2) to one of three conditions: 1) rapid shortening (RS), 2) stretch shortening cycle (SSC), and 3) controls. All groups trained unilateral elbow flexion at 85%-1RM for four sets with three minutes rest between sets. The control group completed a tempo of 2:2, the RS accelerated the weight maximally during flexion and two-second eccentric, and the SSC group completed maximal speed flexion and extension. Only the control group completed repetitions to failure (6 repetitions per set), whereas the RS and SSC groups completed four repetitions per set.\n\nFollowing 12 weeks of training, the control group (who trained to failure) ended up completing more repetitions per set, training volume, time under tension, and rated higher levels of exertion than those in the RS and SSC groups. Despite this, actual adaptations between the groups were comparable. One-repetition maximum strength increased 30.5%, along with isometric maximal voluntary contraction of the elbow flexors (13.3%) over the 12 weeks, with no differences between the groups. Similarly, alterations in elbow flexor cross-sectional area were not different between groups. To make a long story short, training to failure meant completing more work for a comparable amount of growth.\n\nThe fact that failure wasn’t entirely necessary for hypertrophy isn’t surprising in the context of previous data.  Much of the “magic” of training to failure across various training parameters is that it can alter motor unit recruitment, and this is best understood when comparing training intensities (24). The force demands of high versus low load intensity require, for a similar muscle, differing numbers of motor units. Under high load conditions, greater numbers of motor units will be needed as compared to training with light loads at the start of a set. When training to failure, low-load training is associated with longer sets, greater time under tension, and mechanical work completed (5). Throughout this, as fatigue sets in, some motor units keep working, others drop in and out, and others may reduce their force output over time (25). Motor units that may not have been necessary based on the initial load during low-load training will be progressively recruited as other motor units drop out or reduce their force output. While both conditions start with differing motor unit requirements, over the course of a set to failure, comparable motor unit numbers and types may end up being recruited regardless of training parameters (i.e.: intensity).\n\nIt would be premature to suggest that concentric failure is required to “equate” motor unit demands across varying training parameters. While EMG data isn’t necessarily directly reflective of motor unit recruitment, Sundstrup et al (26) demonstrated that normalized EMG signals plateaued approximately 3-5 repetitions before the onset of concentric failure. This indicates that training to failure may not be necessary to “equate” motor unit activity across training conditions. Let’s not forget that motor unit recruitment isn’t a passive process either (27-29), set by load and/or fatigue. They’re your motor units, you chose to use them (27).\n\nThis isn’t an open and shut case. Giessing et al (13) had participants train twice a week for 10 weeks in one of three, single-set conditions: 1) training to their self-determined repetition maximum (short of failure), 2) training to concentric failure, and 3) training performing repetitions to self-determined repetition maximum using the rest pause technique. Following training, the group that trained to failure demonstrated larger effects for various body composition changes (moderate to large effects) as compared to the rest pause group (small to moderate effects). Those who trained to their self-predicted repetition maximum failed to increase muscle mass. These suggest that we may not be that great at identifying where our true repetition maximum is, and that training to failure and using rest-pause techniques may be important for the adaptations to strength training to ensure we’re actually pushing as hard as we think we are.\n\nSo while it seemed that training to failure equates growth across many training parameters (1, 3, 7, 8, 30), the results of Sampson et al (14) suggest that comparable training adaptations can be achieved with less work training short of failure, and Giessing et al (13), just the opposite.  As it stands, the evidence suggests that training to failure makes program design easier, but completing that program may be harder than necessary.\n\nThe molecular argument against training to failure\n\nOthers have suggested that the fatiguing nature of training to failure could impair growth. During fatiguing contractions, an increase in adenosine monophosphate (AMP) occurs as a consequence of increased flux through adenylate kinase, ultimately working to, at least partially, restore ATP concentrations. Gorostiaga et al (31) demonstrated that ATP:AMP ratio was reduced to a greater extent when participants completed 5 sets of 10 repetitions of leg press to failure as opposed to 10 sets of 5 repetitions (non-failure condition). Changes in the ratio of AMP:ATP can activate AMPK kinase (AMPK)(32), which has been shown to act as an inhibitor of a key signaling protein involved in protein synthesis known as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (33,34).\n\nWhile this certainly seems like sound reasoning, I suspect we’ve put the cart before the horse. It’s tempting to associate certain signaling proteins with one training condition or another, and AMPK has been associated with endurance exercise (35), playing a key role in the mitochondrial adaptations required to support the prolonged, repetitive demands of endurance exercise {Hardie:2011fx}. In reality, proteins like AMPK are sensitive to fluctuations in metabolites within the cell, and alterations in the ratio of ATP:AMP can occur irrespective of mode of exercise (36, 37).\n\nDreyer et al (36) demonstrated that protein synthesis is impaired during a strength training session along with a corresponding increase in AMPK. Inhibiting the metabolically expensive protein synthetic response within cells undergoing the metabolic demands of exercise makes sense. But an AMPK response has also been observed outside of the training session. Others have shown an immediate post-exercise AMPK response when sets were taken to concentric failure (37), and activation of p70s6k still occurred, often used as a proxy of subsequent protein synthesis.\n\nRecent work has also shown that activation of AMPK in a concurrent training program had no detrimental effect on mTOR signaling in recovery from a strength training session (38). Coupled with the fact that we’ve already reviewed the existing literature on our outcome of interest that also fails to demonstrate any detriment despite the greater change in the ratio of ATP:AMP when training to failure suggests that we shouldn’t put more weight on the molecular argument over what we know at the “functional,” or hypertrophic level.\n\nI love studying signaling proteins as much as the next guy, but if we have data on the actual primary outcome of interest, in this case hypertrophy, this trumps any arguments constructed on the highly complicated interactions of signaling proteins alone.\n\nMore options, not more growth\n\nWhile it’s entirely plausible that training to failure isn’t necessary for growth (14), it does afford us greater flexibility in the training parameters we can use for hypertrophy training.\n\nBut that increased flexibility may come at price. Many critics often cite increased injury risk and the potential for overtraining (19, 39), but these are merely theoretical arguments, with no hard data to support them. Stone et al (39) have suggested risks to consistently training to failure include overtraining syndrome, and that repetitive micro traumas may result in overuse injuries. Nimmons et al (40) has been cited to support impaired adaptations in strength and power (39), but their data, while lacking the precision measurements used in modern studies, shows no disadvantage from a hypertrophic perspective.  Others suggest that blunted hormonal responses will compromise subsequent adaptations to training (18,41), but reliance on acute hormonal fluctuations to anticipate changes in muscle size isn’t a strong argument (22,23). Such arguments fall short by over-emphasizing the role of failure in training without consideration of the role, and proper programming of other training parameters. Is there really no combination of training parameters (frequency, intensity, etc…) that can be created to use failure successfully in a training program?\n\nIf anything, the frequent use of concentric failure in research studies is evidence of feasibility (1-4,7,8,13,14), although adverse event and adherence reporting in many of these trials leaves much to be desired.\n\nIn the end, training to failure may increase the program design options you have that can promote growth, but may result in the completion of more work than is necessary for a given training adaptation (14). In my opinion, given the purely theoretical basis for injury risk, and the documented, successful use of this training method in much of the literature, it is possible to safely integrate failure into your hypertrophy program, but don’t expect more gains than you trained for.\n\nTake-Home Points\nRecent studies have demonstrated comparable hypertrophy when training across varying intensities (30-80%-1RM), tempos (0.5-10s), and rest intervals when training to concentric failure.\nThere are relatively few direct comparisons on the effects of training to failure on muscle growth. Data regarding the superiority of training to failure is mixed, with some studies showing increased benefit, while others show equivalence to training short of failure.\nArguments against training to failure center on the potential for elevated risk of injury, altered hormonal responses to training, and the creation of a metabolic environment inhibitory to growth. These arguments are largely theoretical in nature lacking objective data on the outcomes of interest.\nThe use of concentric failure in a training program may not enhance the rate of growth consequent to training, but it does provide greater flexibility in the combinations of training parameters that produce growth.\nAddendum August 2017\n\n(from Greg)\n\nA recent study by Martorelli et. al further investigated the effects of training to failure on hypertrophy and strength.\n\nOver 10 weeks, 89 untrained young women did biceps curls using one of three programs:\n\n3 sets to failure with 70% of 1RM\n4 sets stopping shy of failure with 70% of 1RM, with volume matched to that of the failure group (4 sets of 7 reps)\n3 sets of 7 reps with 70% of 1RM\n\nAll three groups experienced very similar increases in strength (which should be expected, since relative loading was matched), but the group training to failure experienced the most hypertrophy – a 17.5% increase in biceps thickness, vs. an 8.5% increase in the volume-matched group, and only a 2.1% increase in the group doing 3 sets of 7 reps.\n\nFrom Martorelli et. al (2017)\n\nHowever, there are a couple reasons to be skeptical of this finding.\n\nWe’re not even entirely sure there was a significant difference between groups.  The stats in this paper were weird, and didn’t report whether or not there were between-group differences for some key measures.\nMethod of load progression wasn’t specified, though it seems load only increased after retesting 1RMs on week 5.  If that’s the case, the group training to failure was training hard every week, whereas weeks 2-5 and 7-10 would have gotten progressively easier for the two non-failure groups as their strength increased (i.e. their sets may have only been 2 reps shy of failure on weeks 1 and 6, but 4-5 reps from failure on weeks 5 and 10).\n\nIt’s also worth nothing that this finding contrasts with that of Sampson and colleagues (14).\n\nWith all of that in mind, this study adds another piece to the puzzle, and muddies the waters a bit.  It’s still clear that training to failure isn’t necessary for hypertrophy, but this study provides some evidence that training to failure may help increase the rate of hypertrophy (though again, that’s not a unanimous finding).\n\nFor a more in-depth discussion of this study, subscribe to Monthly Applications in Strength Sport (MASS) and check out the August 2017 issue.  My colleague Mike Zourdos broke it down in much more detail.\n\nAddendum November 2017\n\nA recent study (reviewed in more depth in MASS) was the first to test the impact of training to failure on recovery.  It included three groups.  One group did three sets of squats and bench to failure, one group did three sets of squats and bench halfway to failure (determined by bar velocity), and one group did six sets of squats and bench halfway to failure.  With this design, the first and third groups performed the same training volume, but only the first group took their sets to failure.\n\nThe group training to failure had larger, longer-lasting decrements in performance (bar speed with various loads) than the groups not training to failure, including the group with matched volume.\n\nThis is a snippet of a larger graphic from the November 2017 issue of MASS. Dotted line is training to failure, dashed line is volume-matched non-failure, and solid line is half-volume non-failure.\n\nNow, a drawback of this study is that the non-failure groups stayed a long way from failure.  The story may be different if the non-failure groups trained at something closer to an 8-9RPE.  However, it does provide us with evidence that training to failure may cause a disproportionate amount of fatigue, which could negatively impact training frequency.\n\nShare this on Facebook and join in the conversation\n\nReferences\n\nMitchell CJ, Churchward-Venne TA, West DWD, Burd NA, Breen L, Baker SK, et al.

    "title": "When to Use Specific Progressive Overload Strategies",
    "content": "When to Use Specific Progressive Overload Strategies\nby Michael Zourdos\nArticles, Programming\nA previous study found that progressing load lifted or reps led to similar increases in strength and muscle size. A new study made the same comparison, but did they find the same results? This article discusses the new study and when to use specific progressive overload strategies.\n\nNote: This article was the MASS Research Review cover story for April 2024 and is a review of a recent study by Chaves et al. If you want more content like this, subscribe to MASS.\n\nKey Points\nWomen and men did unilateral leg extensions 2-3 times per week for 10 weeks. The subjects increased the load lifted as needed on one leg and increased the number of reps per set on the other leg. \nThe researchers found that both methods of progressive overload led to significant increases in leg extension 1RM and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area. There were no significant differences in the pre- to post-study changes between conditions.\nVarious progressive overload strategies can maximize short-term gains in novice trainees. In more trained individuals, especially those aiming to maximize strength, load progression is essential. Additionally, choosing between increasing load or reps is not a binary choice; these progressive overload strategies can be used in conjunction with each other.\n\nEvery week for years, I stared at my training spreadsheet, agonizing over how to achieve progressive overload. Should I increase the load? Should I increase the reps? Should I add sets? Should I shorten the length of the rest period? Should I lift the same weight but do so with my hat backward to ensure I set a new personal record? Sometimes I would agonize so much over these details that I’d try to implement all of them into one training block, which was a surefire way to overcomplicate things (pro tip: even if it’s not “optimal,” pick a strategy, believe in it, and stick with it for at least a little bit). Despite my previous indecision, these are all equally legitimate strategies to achieve progressive overload or to set a PR (well, maybe not the hat adjustment). But is one better than the other?\n\nA previous between-subjects study by Plotkin et al (2 – MASS Review) found that trained women and men had improved strength and muscle size to a (mostly) similar extent when comparing load and rep progression. However, strength gains may have been slightly greater (+5.9%) with load progression in comparison to rep progression. That study recruited trained individuals but tested strength on a Smith machine, despite the fact that participants were more accustomed to the free-weight squat. Thus, these results cannot be perfectly extrapolated to other populations or to “specific strength” (testing strength on the trained exercise). Furthermore, one study is hardly going to deter individuals from agonizing over how to best progress training to maximize muscle growth. Fortunately, a new within-subjects design study by Chaves et al (1) once again compared load and rep progressions for strength and hypertrophy in a mixed-sex population, but this time they tested specific strength. \n\nPurpose and Hypotheses\nPurpose\n\nThe primary purpose of the reviewed study was to compare changes in leg extension 1RM and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area over 10 weeks of training that progressed either the load lifted or reps performed in untrained men and women.\n\nHypotheses  \n\nThe researchers hypothesized that load progression would lead to greater increases in both strength and muscle size than volume progression. They anticipated that load progression would lead to greater changes in the volume load (sets × reps × load lifted) over time, which would ultimately translate to greater gains in strength and size.\n\nSubjects and Methods\nSubjects\n\nThirty-nine women (n = 19) and men (n = 20) who had not performed resistance or aerobic training for at least six months participated in the study. Additional characteristics of the subjects are presented in Table 1.\n\nStudy Overview and Training Protocols\n\nThe researchers used a longitudinal within-subjects design in which all subjects completed each training condition. Specifically, over the course of 10 weeks, all subjects performed unilateral leg extension training and achieved progressive overload on one leg by increasing the load while they increased the reps throughout the study on the other leg. Subjects trained both legs two to three times per week for a total of 23 training sessions. The condition-specific protocols and progression schemes are presented in Table 2.\n\nOutcomes\n\nResearchers assessed vastus lateralis cross-sectional area via ultrasonography and leg extension 1RM before and after the 10-week training intervention. Researchers also compared the load lifted (absolute and % of 1RM), number of reps performed, and volume load between the conditions.  \n\nFindings\nOverall Findings\n\nThe researchers found that the subjects significantly increased both strength and cross-sectional area (p < 0.0001). There was no significant condition × time interaction for changes in either strength (p = 0.20) or cross-sectional area (p > 0.87; Table 3). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in volume load progression between the training conditions (p = 0.19; Figure 1). \n\nThe only significant differences that existed were directly related to study design choices. Specifically, the subjects lifted heavier loads in the load progression condition (p < 0.001; Table 4) and performed 292 more reps in the rep progression protocol (1292 ± 302 versus 1000 ± 67 reps; p < 0.001). \n\nInterpretation\n\nThe presently reviewed study from Chaves et al (1) found that achieving progressive overload by increasing load or increasing reps led to similar gains in leg extension 1RM and quad hypertrophy. Another recent study by Plotkin et al (2 – MASS Review) also compared load and rep progression and found similar results. This interpretation compares these two studies and discusses the situations in which the specific method of progressive overload may matter. \n\nComparison of Chaves et al (1) and Plotkin et al (2)\n\nOn the surface, the protocols in both studies and the findings from both studies (1, 2) were similar, but important differences existed. Regarding the similarities, Plotkin et al (2) used a nearly identical protocol that consisted of a load progression group starting with 4 × 8-12RM (9-12 RM was used in the present study), and the load was increased when failure was reached outside of the target rep range. Plotkin et al had the rep progression group complete 4 sets to failure with a 10RM each session and increased reps as they could, which was identical to the present study. Furthermore, both studies reported that group-level gains in strength and muscle tended to be similar between progression protocols. However, Plotkin et al reported that strength increased “slightly” more (+5.9%) in the load progression group, and that the rep progression group experienced a 1.8% greater change in the sum of all rectus femoris site muscle thicknesses. Therefore, it is imperative to discuss methodological differences to determine why there may have been slightly different findings and what this means for the lifter. The three methodological differences to discuss are: 1) training status of the subjects, 2) exercise selection, and 3) the study design. \n\nThe first thing to consider is whether the percentage differences in favor of load (strength) and rep (hypertrophy) progression in Plotkin et al (2) are real differences. I think there is merit to say that individuals generally gained more strength from load progression in Plotkin et al’s study, but probably not enough merit to say that rep progression was superior for hypertrophy. In the presently reviewed study from Chaves et al (1), there was essentially no difference at the group level (+1.4% in favor of load progression) for leg extension 1RM when progressing load. Although load is clearly the primary driver of strength gains (3), the subjects in the current study were either untrained or had not trained for at least six months, whereas those in Plotkin et al had trained for nearly four years, on average. Although load may play a role in strength gain for untrained participants, it seems to matter more for trained individuals (3). Furthermore, Glass et al (4 – MASS Review) observed robust strength gains in untrained individuals who used only ~40-60% of 1RM. Therefore, it’s possible that the novice training status of subjects in the presently reviewed study explains the lack of between-condition differences in strength gains.\n\nChaves et al (1) had participants train a low-skilled movement, the leg extension, while Plotkin et al (2) utilized the free-weight back squat for training sessions. It’s possible that the subjects in Plotkin et al experienced enhanced strength benefits due utilizing a highly skilled free-weight exercise. Interestingly, Plotkin et al actually tested strength on the Smith machine squat despite training with a free-weight squat; however, it is possible that the Smith machine squat was similar enough to the free-weight squat so that heavier loading in training for the load progression group was more beneficial. I am a bit torn on whether or not I really think training the free-weight squat with heavier loading was more beneficial for Smith machine strength, so I would probably lean more into the training status argument to explain the potentially greater strength gains in Plotkin et al. \n\nLastly, the Plotkin et al (2) study had a between-subjects design, while the present study by Chaves et al (1) had a within-subjects design. I have previously written about the differences between these two study designs in greater depth. In brief, a between-subjects study, such as Plotkin et al, compares two groups of subjects, in which one group performs one training program and the other group performs a different training program. Importantly, the individual response to training is highly variable (5), and this design does not allow the researcher to determine how an individual would respond to the other protocol. Therefore, in an underpowered study (which is many, if not most, training studies), if one group had significantly greater gains than another group, on average, it is possible that many in one group did not respond well to that protocol rather than the protocol itself being inferior for everyone. For example, in the study by Plotkin et al, the range of increase in Smith squat 1RM was +5.8-55.7 kg (load progression group) and +4.0-33.2 (rep progression group); thus, we do not know if some individuals would have responded better or worse in the opposite protocol. In contrast, Chaves et al (1) used a within-subjects design. Unfortunately, Chaves et al did not report individual subject data; therefore, we still do not know how individuals responded to each protocol. However, the differences between groups for strength gains (1.2%) and muscle growth (0.6%) were very small; thus, it would be surprising if there were large differences in within-individual rates of progress.\n\nIt should also be noted that while a within-subjects design does allow us to examine how an individual responds to both protocols, there is an important limitation of this design as it pertains to strength gains. Specifically, training one limb will lead to the “cross-education” effect, which is the improvement in strength of the opposite limb that is trained (6). While I wrote about this in depth here, data show that if individuals train one limb and not the other they will increase strength about 7-10% in the untrained limb, on average, in 4-12 weeks when training with ≥60% of 1RM (7, 8). Therefore, it’s possible in the presently reviewed study that the benefits of increased loading in the load progression group were also realized in the rep progression group, which explains the lack of between-condition difference in strength gains. To be clear, I don’t think that’s why the strength gains were so close (1.2% difference) between groups, but it’s possible that the cross-education effect dampened the difference, even if to a trivial degree. Importantly, training one limb will not increase muscle size in the other limb; thus, the cross-education effect does not manifest for hypertrophy.\n\nIn reality, the findings of the two studies were quite similar. It’s worth reiterating that Plotkin et al (2) did not find that there were true differences between groups for strength gains, rather the point estimate for strength gains “slightly” favored the load progression. Furthermore, similar hypertrophy between groups is not surprising, as the current study found that volume load and volume load progression were not significantly different between groups, and both studies were set-equated between the load and rep progression protocols. \n\nSpecific Situations Dictating Progressive Overload Style\n\nWhen I reviewed the aforementioned study by Plotkin et al (2) in Volume 6, Issue 12, I discussed many different ways to achieve progressive overload, and how these different strategies could be intertwined. There is not much sense in a comprehensive rehashing of those details, since you can simply click here and read that article. In brief, the load could be progressed based on a predetermined percentage or absolute loading change, a previous session RIR or velocity, or by plus set performance to name a few. Additionally, the load, rep, and set progressions are not mutually exclusive and can be intertwined. For example, this table demonstrates how the load is only increased after a lifter can perform a certain number of sets with a given load, illustrating how the load is only increased after a certain number of reps are achieved with that given load.  Now that we are aware of all these progressive overload strategies, let’s discuss when different strategies might be preferable.\n\nLet us begin with progression when strength is the primary goal. Obviously, load progression is an essential and non-negotiable type of progression that must occur to maximize 1RM strength over the long turn. However, does load progression need to happen all the time? The answer is a clear “no.” For example, a powerlifter can use a simple model in which they increase the load by 2.5 kg each week as they approach competition, ultimately reaching heavy loads (i.e., ≥90% of 1RM); however, they may not be able to progress load each week, in which case they should not force it. In these situations, it may be better to add an additional set or rep and then increase the load the following week. Alternatively, the lifter could autoregulate the training load from week-to-week when peaking for a powerlifting meet or gym test day; thus, they would only increase the load when they were able to. For example, a lifter could program 3 × 2 @1-2 RIR and would lift whatever load they could do for two reps in that RIR range, which would sometimes be heavier, lighter, or even the same compared to the previous week’s training.\n\nMoreover, someone with strength as their main goal will still perform volume blocks from time to time, in which muscle growth is targeted. In these situations, there is no pressure to increase the load, at least not each week. Therefore, intertwining load with rep or set benchmarks is an effective strategy. As seen here, a lifter could be prescribed a set and RIR benchmark in which the load only progressed once the benchmark was reached. For example, a lifter could be prescribed squats with 3 × 8 with 100kg and add a set each week as long as they complete all sets at ≥2 RIR. Then, once they were able to perform 5 × 8 at 2 RIR they would increase the load. Alternatively, a strength-focused individual in a volume block could tie load increases to a rep benchmark. In volume blocks, individuals focused on strength may utilize programming strategies, such as rest-pause training, which have progressive overload built-in by attempting to perform more reps each time the strategy is used. \n\nI’ve been on record saying that training for muscle growth is a lot more forgiving than training for strength. Of course, the two (hypertrophy and strength) are interrelated, but if strength is the main objective, then load progression is a must at some point, periodization seems to matter (9 – MASS Review), and a lifter must practice the specific exercise with which they are going to test their strength (i.e., a powerlifter must perform the squat, bench press, and deadlift). While there are some “rules” for hypertrophy such as more volume (to a point) drives muscle growth and the individual should have enough exercise variety, traditional (strength focused) models of periodization do not seem to matter (9) and progressive overload can be achieved through various methods. An individual can use rep or set progression models as described above. The lifter can also manipulate RIR throughout the course of a training block to achieve progressive overload. Specifically, a lifter could keep the number of sets constant and increase the load so that the RIR decreases from week-to-week to train closer to failure. Alternatively, a lifter could choose to maintain the same load and add sets each week during the training block. In this situation, the RIR might actually increase, but the increase in RIR (training farther from failure) might make it more feasible for the lifter to add multiple additional sets. Yet another strategy could be for the lifter to shorten interest rest periods to make each set more difficult. This time-saving strategy may also allow the lifter to add an extra set. To be clear, I am not saying that any one strategy is any more desirable than another; rather, I am just presenting various options. Table 5 summarizes the appropriate progressive overload strategies for both strength and hypertrophy.\n\nCoach’s Corner\n\nLet’s finish up with a “coach’s corner” section to discuss practical points for coaches and lifters when putting progressive overload into action.\n\nFirst, lifters will not be able to progress every session or week, and anyone who has trained for a substantial amount of time knows this. Therefore, since you know this, do not force progression every week and try your best (although I know it’s tough) not to get frustrated if you are lifting the same load for a couple of weeks in a row. Recall that the goal is progressing over time. The goal is not to increase the load (or set or reps) for its own sake. Saying “I did 40 sets of quads this week” shouldn’t be a badge of honor (although it is kind of awesome). If that’s fun, by all means, go for it. However, if the goal is to maximize strength or strive for the best aesthetics then don’t chase the set, rep, or load number, chase the strength or physique progress, which may sometimes come from being disciplined enough to not progress variables during a single week.\n\nSecondly, don’t get paralyzed while deciding which progressive overload strategy to use. All of the strategies mentioned in this article have merits. Find one that applies to your goals and stick with it for an entire training block. As a coach and lifter, I have agonized many times over what exact method to use for myself or for various athletes. Typically, I am better at choosing a method for others, but for myself, I would often try to integrate too many different concepts, mitigating their effectiveness or losing focus on the main goal (progress). My caution is to avoid this trap and find a logical progressive overload strategy that is appropriate for you (or your client’s) goals and stick with it for a decent period of time.\n\nNext Steps\n\nIn my review of Plotkin et al (2), I called for a new study comparing load versus rep progression, but with a free-weight exercise used in both training and testing. The presently reviewed study was a good addition to the literature for the hypertrophy outcomes because it was a within-subjects design. For strength outcomes, it’s possible that the cross-education effect confounded the results, although I doubt to a very meaningful degree. Additionally, in a within-subjects design movements such as squats and bench presses cannot be used. Therefore, I will again suggest that the next step would be to compare load versus rep progressions in trained individuals using a free-weight squat or bench press as both training and testing exercises.\n\nApplication and Takeaways\n\nChaves et al (1) found that over 10 weeks, untrained individuals experienced similar strength gains and hypertrophy regardless of whether they achieved progressive overload by increasing the load or the number of reps, although we should be cognizant that the cross-education effect may have confounded the strength findings. However, the lack of differences between training protocols in this study does not mean that the method of progressive overload is always immaterial. In general, those interested in strength must increase their load at times, specifically in the training block immediately preceding a strength competition (e.g., powerlifting meet) or 1RM test day. When muscle growth is the main goal, lifters have much more flexibility to achieve progressive overload via load and/or repetition adjustments. Ultimately, progressive overload strategies can be intertwined and coaches and lifters should not consider themselves bound to the binary choice of load or rep progression.\n\nGet more articles like this\n\nThis article was the cover story for the April 2024 issue of MASS Research Review.

    "content": "Rest times for muscle growth\nby Milo Wolf\nApril 24, 2024\nAt this point, resting 1-2 minutes between sets seems to be a solid guideline for maximizing hypertrophy.\n\nToday, I’m excited to share insights from ​our recent pre-printed meta-analysis on rest intervals​. In a ​previous video​, I discussed rest times, but this new analysis has introduced some significant updates.\n\nFortunately, the findings of our new study suggest that you may not need to rest for quite as long as we previously thought. This is great news for those of us who have limited time to train (recording ​5-hour podcast episodes​ doesn’t leave us much time to lift!).\n\nHere’s a breakdown of our findings: We reviewed all the research that varied rest times between groups while controlling for other variables such as volume and assessed hypertrophy. Initially, when we compared the “shorter-rest” groups to the “longer-rest” groups across these studies, it was relatively clear that those resting longer generally saw more hypertrophy.\n\nBut that doesn’t fully answer how long your rest periods should be. So, we further categorized the data into four baskets: “short” (<1 min), “intermediate” (1-2 mins), “long” (2-3 mins), and “very long” (3+ mins).\n\nOur analysis showed that resting for less than one minute might indeed diminish hypertrophy, which aligns with my earlier conclusions. Surprisingly, the optimal muscle growth was observed with 1-2 minutes of rest, and there was little difference in hypertrophy outcomes between the 1-2 minute, 2-3 minute, and 3+ minute rest intervals. Although longer rest times past 2 minutes were associated with less muscle growth, the magnitude was small enough not to worry about.\n\nThis finding challenged my previous assumption that 1-2 minutes would be insufficient for maximal muscle growth. However, it appears I was mistaken.\n\nYou might argue, “As someone who’s quite well-trained, I think I need more rest than the relatively untrained participants in these studies.” That might be true. As you advance in your training, you handle heavier weights, expend more energy, and impose greater metabolic and cardiovascular demands on your body. Conversely, though, over time, your cardiorespiratory fitness also improves, so you should be able to handle those demands better. So, does that mean trained lifters should rest shorter or longer than new lifters?\n\nInterestingly, three of the nine studies we analyzed involved somewhat trained lifters. One study (​1​) found significantly more hypertrophy in both upper and lower body muscles when resting for 3 minutes as opposed to 1 minute. However, the other two studies (​2​, ​3​) observed greater hypertrophy in groups resting for an average of ~80 seconds (rest intervals gradually decreasing from 120 to 30 seconds of rest over the course of the study) compared to a fixed 120 second rest interval.\n\nThe question of whether more trained individuals need longer rest periods remains somewhat open, but it shouldn’t be a major concern. You likely don’t need to maximize performance on every set for effective hypertrophy, and you might recover adequately within 1-2 minutes.\n\nTakeaways\n\nAt this point, resting 1-2 minutes between sets seems to be a solid guideline for maximizing hypertrophy. Anything beyond that is mostly anecdotal or speculative. However, based on practical experience, you might benefit from slightly longer rests if you’re performing higher reps, training closer to failure, are using multi-joint exercises, are training your lower-body, and/or are a more advanced lifter.\n\nConversely, you can certainly opt for less than 60 seconds between sets and still achieve growth, though you might need more sets to achieve similar benefits.\n\nOverall, great news for those of us who like being in-and-out of the gym!\n\nGet these newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe Stronger By Science weekly newsletter features practical training tips and summaries of the latest research.

    "title": "Bench Press Bar Path: How to Fix Your Bar Path for a Bigger Bench",
    "content": "Bench Press Bar Path: How to Fix Your Bar Path for a Bigger Bench\nby Greg Nuckols\nArticles, Bench, Technique\nThis is a bench press tweak you should know about. Learn how to optimize your bar path for a bigger bench. It makes a bigger difference than you realize.\nWhat you’re getting yourself into:\n\n2,500 words, 8-17 minute read time\n\nKey points:\nDrive the bar back toward your face as you press the bar off your chest instead of initiating the press by driving the bar straight up.  This makes the lift MUCH more efficient.\nMost people can lift more weight pretty quickly simply by correcting their bench press bar path, and at the elite levels, adopting a more efficient bar path is the primary way lifters keep improving their numbers.\nThat’s about it.  The rest of the article is mainly graphs and pictures to illustrate this point in case it doesn’t click for you right away.\n\nLet’s take a trip back in time to 1984.\n\n1984 was a great year, for three primary reasons\n\nVan Halen put out their best album (some people argue for 5150.  They are wrong).\nApple launched the Macintosh computer.\nThomas McLaughlin published Bench Press More Now:  Breakthroughs in Biomechanics and Training Methods.\n\nTo this day, McLaughlin’s book is probably the best resource for the bench press in existence.  It’s not without its faults or omissions (it doesn’t even touch on leg drive, for example), and it’s probably a hair too technical for some readers, but I haven’t come across another resource that approaches its combined level of technical analysis and applicability.\n\nIt’s a shame that more lifters don’t know of the work that came out of McLaughlin’s lab at Auburn.  From the late ’70s through the ’80s, they published a lot of very good, very applicable studies on powerlifting.  McLaughlin and several of his research partners were nationally ranked powerlifters, and they gathered a lot of their data from the best source imaginable if you want to understand elite powerlifting performance:  high-level powerlifting meets.  In several of their studies, they wouldn’t include a lifter’s data unless the lifter was ranked in the top 10 in his weight class. In one particularly amusing example from a squat study, their “low skill” group included lifters who squatted 620 at 242 and 550 at 193 (their “high skill” group included only national champions).\n\nAt its core, the book is based on several studies that compared the bench press technique of world-class benchers to the bench press technique of “novice” benchers (their novices still benched 224 at 170, on average, and would be considered “well-trained” by the standards of a lot of studies) with maximal loads.  Any old-looking picture in this article comes McLaughlin’s books, which you can read spread across 16 parts on everyone’s favorite old-time strength blog (part 1 is here).\n\nIt has a lot of interesting insights, but there’s just one that I want to focus on in this article:  bench press bar path.\n\nHe found that both the novice benchers and the elite benchers lowered the bar using a similar pattern:  roughly a straight line, arcing out slightly.  However, their bar paths during the press itself differed drastically.  The novice lifters pressed almost straight up initially, with the bar then moving up and back more toward the top half of the lift.  The elite lifters followed the opposite pattern – they initially pressed the bar up and back at the start of the lift, and finished the lift by pressing the bar almost straight up toward the top half of the lift.\n\nThe picture on the left shows the bench press bar path of a novice benching 245lbs. In the middle is Mike Bridges benching 463lbs. On the right is Kaz benching 605lbs.\n\nWhen he looked at elite lifters who’d improved their performance over time (since he collected data at all the major meets over a 4-year period), and compared them to elite lifters whose performance had stalled, he saw the same trend.  Elite lifters who hadn’t improved their bench numbers used roughly the same bar path every year, while elite lifters whose bench numbers continued to rise pushed the bar back toward their face to start the press more and more as their lifts improved.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nThe simplest explanation:  This technique decreases total flexion demands at the shoulder with any given grip width.\n\nTo complete a bench press, you have to perform three basic movements: shoulder flexion (like a front delt raise), shoulder horizontal flexion (like a pec fly), and elbow extension.\n\nThis article isn’t going to address elbow extension demands (how hard a lift is for your triceps) because this article seeks to isolate the effects of bar path, which doesn’t affect elbow extension demands too terribly much; elbow extension demands are primarily a function of grip width and whether your elbows stay under the bar or not.\n\nSo we’re left with two functions that are impacted by bar path:  shoulder flexion, and shoulder horizontal flexion.\n\nLuckily, we can simplify things even further, because differentiating between the two doesn’t matter all that much for our purposes here.  The main muscles carrying out both roles are your pecs and your front delts.  Both of them can flex the shoulder, and both of them can horizontally flex the shoulder.  The front delts are a bit better at flexion, and the pecs are a bit better at horizontal flexion, but they both contribute, regardless of the mix of flexion and horizontal flexion demands.  So, rather than separate out flexion and horizontal flexion demands, I’ll just lump both of them together and refer to the sum of flexion and horizontal flexion demands as “total flexion demands.”\n\nSo, what determines total flexion demands?\n\nAs with anything else:  joint moments.  Load x moment arm.\n\nIf you shorten the moment arm, total flexion demands decrease, so you can lift a greater load, or you can lift a given load with more ease.  So, what determines the length of the moment arm?\n\nImagine a plane passing through your shoulder joint that’s parallel to the floor.  Since the barbell’s force is pressing straight down into your hand, draw a line straight down from your hand to the plane.  Then draw a straight line between that intersection point and your shoulder.  That’s your moment arm.\n\nDon’t worry!  That sounds convoluted, but it’s actually pretty simple.  There are two things that change the length of that moment arm:\n\nGrip width\nThe distance from the bar to your shoulder in the frontal plane (if you’re looking at it from the side, then this would be the horizontal distance between the bar and your shoulder).\n\nA wider grip increases the length of this moment arm, as does increased distance from the bar to your shoulder in the frontal plane.  Grip width determines the horizontal flexion aspect of total flexion demands, and frontal-plane distance from the bar to the shoulder determines the flexion aspect of total flexion demands.\n\nSo, assuming any given grip width and any given load, the only thing that really impacts total shoulder flexion demands is the position of the bar in relation to the shoulder.  Total flexion demands at the shoulder decrease the closer the bar is to being directly over the shoulder, and total flexion demands at the shoulder increase the further the bar is from the shoulder in the frontal plane.\n\nGrip width doesn’t change (dark blue), but as the bar gets further in front of the shoulder (light blue), the moment arm (black) gets longer and longer, meaning the lift gets harder and harder.\n\nI think we all realize this when we’re holding the bar at lockout.  It’s a lot easier to hold the bar directly over your shoulders than it is to hold the bar over your sternum or your upper stomach, for example.  The exact same principle applies at every other point in the lift.\n\nOf course, if you wanted to take this principle to its logical extreme, you’d assume that the guillotine press must inherently be the most efficient way to bench press.  Keep the bar directly over your shoulders the whole time, and you’re golden, right?\n\nTouching the bar lower on your chest obviously shortens the range of motion, assuming you get a decent arch.  Not only does this decrease the effort required to complete each rep with a given load, it also keeps you from having to go through extreme ranges of motion that will inherently be weaker.  Regardless of external moments, maximal internal moments – the moments your muscles produce at each joint to move your limbs and extend the bar – drop off rapidly as range of motion increases past a certain point.\n\nTouching low can be overdone too, of course.  If you touch too low, total flexion demands continue increasing, negating any advantage you may have gotten by limiting range of motion.  As with most things, there’s a happy middle.  Anywhere from just below the nipples to about an inch below the xiphoid process of your sternum works best for most people.\n\nAssuming you touch the bar (reasonably) low on your chest/high on your stomach, the next challenge is to actually press the weight back up.\n\nThis is where McLaughlin’s research comes into play.\n\nThe novice lifters initiated the press by shoving the bar essentially straight up off their chest, with the bar path angled back only slightly.  Since the bar didn’t move back toward their shoulders very much, total flexion demands at the shoulders were still very high (relative to the load they were lifting) when the bar reached the sticking point of the lift a few inches off the chest.\n\nThe elite lifters, on the other hand, initiated the press by shoving the bar up off their chests and back toward their shoulders.  Since the bar did move back toward their shoulders, total flexion demands at the shoulders decreased as the bar approached the sticking point.\n\nAverage bench press bar paths for novice lifters (dashed line) vs. elite lifters (solid line).  Especially pay attention to the short segment between points 4 and 6 on each line.\n\nCompare the sticking points (the point where the lifters were applying the smallest amount of force to the bar) of the novice lifters to those of the elite lifters:\n\nOne thing worth noting about this picture:  The “heavy experts” dot is a bit further from the shoulder than it “should” be if this was scaled for body size.  The novices and the light experts were roughly the same height and had torsos roughly the same length, but the heavy experts were taller and had longer torsos, so 5 inches in front of their shoulders would be closer to ~4 inches in front of the shoulders of the other two groups, so for an even more accurate representation, that dot should be moved back toward the head a bit.\n\nRegardless, both groups of experts had much less horizontal distance between the bar and their shoulders than did the novice group.  This helps minimize the total shoulder flexion demands, increasing how much force they could apply to the bar.\n\nSo, how large of a payoff can you expect from that technique change?\n\nA pretty big one.\n\nForce output at different points in the movement for novice and elite lifters.\n\nMcLaughlin found that the elite benchers could bench about 10-12% less than the maximum force observed in the movement, and about 4-5% more than the minimum force observed in the movement.  The novices, on the other hand, could bench about 35% less than the the maximum force observed in the movement, and about 7-8% more than the minimum force observed in the movement.\n\nRemember, you don’t miss a lift because you are too weak through the full range of motion.  You miss a lift because you were too weak through the very weakest part of the lift.  For all three groups, their bench maxes were slightly above their minimum force output, which is what you’d expect.  It doesn’t matter if you have “extra” maximum force at some stronger point in the lift – your minimum force at the weakest point in the lift is what will stop you from completing a rep.\n\nIn both groups of elite lifters, their minimum force output was only about 13-14% lower than their maximum force output, indicating a very smooth and efficient lift, whereas for the novice lifters, their minimum force output was about 32-33% lower than their maximum force output, indicating a very inefficient lift.\n\nThat inefficiency primarily came from their bar path.  Their force production dropped off so rapidly because when they reached the position of minimum force – the sticking point – they were in a horrible position to exert force on the bar because the total flexion demands at the shoulder were unnecessarily high.\n\nIf we took a myopic view of this information, we’d assume that simply changing the bar path would instantly increase their bench press from 224 to about 270 (about 10-12% less than their maximum force output, bringing them in line with the elite lifters) instantly.\n\nObviously that never happens in the real world…at least not instantaneously.\n\nAs previously mentioned, one thing that McLaughlin noted in his research was that the elite lifters’ maximum force output didn’t change much from year to year, but some continued adding weight to their bench press, while some plateaued.\n\nThe ones who kept benching more and more in spite of minimal changes in maximum force output were the ones who altered their technique over time, pushing the bar back toward their shoulders further and sooner.  The people who didn’t keep adding weight to their bench press were the ones who didn’t make this technique adjustment.\n\nHere’s the type of change this adjustment can make:\n\nMike Bridges added 60lbs to his bench in a year (386 to 446) by altering his bar path to dramatically increase the minimum force he could exert on the bar.  Force = mass x acceleration, and the minimum acceleration (labeled “7” on both graphs, coinciding with minimum force) increased dramatically between 1978 and 1979, allowing him to bench more even as maximum acceleration decreased (maximum force still increased a bit though, because there was more weight on the bar).  This is the hallmark of more efficient technique:  minimum force during the movement approaching maximum force.\n\nHowever, it’s worth reiterating that it took Bridges an entire year to transform his technique and take his elite-level bench to world-record levels.  There are two main reasons altering your bar path won’t increase your bench by nearly that much instantly:\n\nIt’ll take some practice for the new bar path to feel natural, and for you to build skill and automaticity with a slightly altered motor pattern.\nYour current technique may be hiding weaknesses – specifically muscles that are currently weak through a particular range of motion.\n\nHowever, neither of those things take too long to address, at least on the time scale of an entire training career.  These are both areas where you can see meaningful progress in a matter of weeks or months, not a matter of years (unlike the glacial pace of hypertrophy at the elite levels).\n\nMotor learning is a (relatively) fast process, and developing strength through this slightly different range of motion shouldn’t take too long, because the changes in joint angles and muscular demands aren’t particularly big.\n\nThis bench press bar path makes the midrange of the lift a lot easier on the anterior deltoids, but slightly harder on the pecs.  Splitting the total flexion demands apart again, shoulder flexion demands are way lower (which is why it’s easier on the anterior deltoids) and horizontal flexion demands are unchanged.  However, when you reposition the bar over the shoulders, the anterior deltoids can’t help out quite as much anymore, so the movement gets a little more challenging for your pecs.\n\nSimply correcting your bar path and benching with this technique should naturally strengthen the pecs more.\n\nHere’s how it looks in practice:\n\nTop: good. Bottom: bad.\n\nOne final question I’m sure someone will ask:  Isn’t the easiest path between two points a straight line?\n\nIn this case, no.  Remember, gravity is pulling the bar straight down.  Total work done on the bar is simply defined by the vertical distance you have to move it, not total distance.  If you’re touching the bar to the same place on your chest/stomach, you’re using the same grip width, and your arms aren’t magically getting longer or shorter, total work done on the bar is identical regardless of bar path.\n\nThis is a question about how to do that work the most efficiently.\n\nTotal work done on the bar is the same regardless of bench press bar path, but driving back and then up is simply the most efficient way to go about producing that work.\n\nSo, to wrap things up, here’s what you should do:\n\nTake video of your bench press from the side.\nUse an app like Iron Path to see your bar path.\nIf your bar path resembles the elite lifters in McLaughlin’s studies, great!\nOtherwise, work on purposefully driving the bar back toward your shoulders as you press it off your chest.  Consistently take video to observe the changes.  It may feel a little weird at first, but you’ll get the hang of it in no time.\nKeep grinding away at it, and you should start hitting PRs within a couple of months (likely sooner).\n\nIf you want to see a great example of how this looks with huge weights in real time, check out this video from Dan Green:\n\nClick to accept marketing cookies and enable this content\n\nOne final technical note:  some very savvy readers may notice that I disregarded horizontal forces on the bar in my analysis.  However, in this case, they don’t change the overall picture because they would be the same regardless of bar path, so addressing them would have just bogged things down without any meaningful payoff.\n\nShare this on Facebook and join in the conversation\n\nGreg Nuckols\nGreg Nuckols has over a decade of experience under the bar, a BS in Exercise and Sports Science, and a Master's in Exercise Physiology.

    "content": "Bench Press Range of Motion: An Exception to the Principle of Specificity?\nby Greg Nuckols\nArticles, Bench, Hypertrophy, Programming\nMuch of what we know about range of motion specificity comes from single-joint studies and squat studies. When we branch out to the bench press, things get more complicated.\n\nThis article is a review and breakdown of a recent study. The study reviewed is Bench Press at Full Range of Motion Produces Greater Neuromuscular Adaptations than Partial Executions After Prolonged Resistance Training by Martínez-Cava et al (2019)\n\nKey Points\nSubjects trained for 10 weeks, doing either full bench press reps or one of two partial ranges of motion (⅓ reps or ⅔ reps). They tested strength and velocity at all three ranges of motion pre- and post-training.\nUnexpectedly, the full range of motion group tended to improve the most in all measures at all ranges of motion, not just the full range of motion measures. The ⅓ range of motion group tended to improve the least in all measures, even for the ⅓ range of motion tests.\nWhile the principle of specificity has a tremendous amount of support, we need to remember that it’s a principle, not an iron-clad law of the universe. In the interpretation section, I’ll discuss when it may or may not apply.\n\nO\nne of the first things you learn about when you start consuming strength training content is the principle of specificity. The principle of specificity has wide-reaching implications, but one of the well-known applications is range of motion specificity: you gain the most strength in the range of motion you train for. In other words, if I want to improve my deep squat, I’d want to do deep squats, but if I want to improve my half squat, I’d be better off doing half squats.\n\nHowever, we need to keep in mind that the principle of specificity is more of a strong heuristic rather than an iron-clad law of the universe. Sometimes, it doesn’t apply. And when it doesn’t, we can learn something by thinking through the factors that may be able to “override” such an important principle.\n\nIn the present study (1), three groups of subjects trained the bench press through either a full range of motion, a ⅔ range of motion, or a ⅓ range of motion, with strength and velocity testing for all three ranges of motion pre- and post-training. The full range of motion group improved the most for tests through all ranges of motion, while the ⅓ range of motion group got the worst results, including on the tests in the range of motion they were actually training. The interpretation section will dig into factors that may explain why the results of this study run counter to what we’d expect, given the principle of specificity.\n\n[feature_box style=”4″ only_advanced=”There%20are%20no%20title%20options%20for%20the%20choosen%20style” alignment=”center”]\n\nThis article is from a previous issue of Monthly Applications in Strength Sport (MASS), our monthly research review with Greg Nuckols, Eric Trexler, Eric Helms and Mike Zourdos.

More details about the subjects can be seen in Table 1.\n\nExperimental Design\n\nBefore any performance testing, the subjects underwent nine familiarization sessions: three sessions of ⅓ bench reps, three sessions of ⅔ bench press, and three sessions of full bench reps. After familiarization was completed, the subjects underwent three testing sessions. In each session, they completed a load-velocity profile and a 1RM test with one bench press range of motion (i.e. ⅓ reps, ⅔ reps, or full reps). The order of the testing sessions was randomized for each subject, and the same order was repeated for post-testing. The load-velocity testing started at 20kg, with loads increased by 10kg per set until mean propulsive velocity (2) fell below 0.5 m/s, after which time loads increased by 2.5-5 kg per set until a 1RM was reached. Subjects performed 3 reps per set with light loads (<50% 1RM), 2 reps per set with moderate loads (50-80% 1RM), and 1 rep per set with heavy loads (>80% 1RM).\n\nAfter the initial testing sessions were completed, subjects were assigned to one of four groups in a counterbalanced fashion based on pre-training bench press strength. One group trained doing ⅓ reps, one group trained doing ⅔ reps, one group trained doing full reps, and a control group didn’t train at all. The three experimental groups trained twice per week for 10 weeks, using a linearly periodized training program. Loads were selected and adjusted using velocity targets that were intended to correspond with the target intensity for the day. Details of the training program can be seen in Table 2. After 10 weeks of training, the performance tests were repeated.\n\nThe researchers did a good job of standardizing as many aspects of the study as possible. The subjects trained using a Smith machine (this probably wasn’t necessary, but it does make velocity data a little more accurate since all of the movement is completely vertical, though this accuracy comes at the cost of a bit of ecological validity), grip width was standardized (5-7 cm outside of shoulder width), and safety bars were used to ensure that range of motion was appropriate and consistent for each rep. The subjects lowered the bar to safety pins and paused for two seconds before pressing each rep, making the demarcation between the eccentric and concentric crystal clear, thus theoretically improving velocity measurements and ensuring a consistent range of motion. Furthermore, subjects were instructed to maintain a velocity of 0.45-0.65m/s for their eccentrics (with the aid of visual and audio feedback from the velocity device used in the study), and to press each concentric as explosively as possible.\n\n[feature_box style=”4″ only_advanced=”There%20are%20no%20title%20options%20for%20the%20choosen%20style” alignment=”center”]\n\nPrefer to listen?

Subscribe to MASS here. \n\n[/feature_box]\n\nFindings\n\nSurprisingly, the group doing full reps tended to improve the most in all measures, and the ⅓ reps group tended to improve the least. According to the principle of specificity, one would have expected that the full reps group would improve the most at full reps, the ⅔ reps group would improve the most at ⅔ reps, and the ⅓ reps group would improve the most at ⅓ reps. However, that was not the case. Figure 1 tells the story. Note that not all differences between groups were statistically significant (and there are 72 potential pairwise comparisons; it’s not worth going through all of them one by one), but the overall pattern is crystal clear.\n\nInterpretation\n\nUpon reading the title of this article, I thought it was going to be a straightforward article that I could review in my sleep. “There’s this thing called the ‘principle of specificity,’ here are all of the studies backing it, and the present study adds one more to the pile.” In and out, easy peasy.\n\nHowever, this study does not fit that narrative. Training through a full range of motion was best for improving performance through a full range of motion, but training through a partial range of motion wasn’t best for improving performance through a partial range of motion. In fact, the ⅓ range of motion group had the worst gains though the ⅓ range of motion in three of the four measures. So, I can’t just type out my stock “principle of specificity” spiel and call it a day. However, while that makes this article more difficult to interpret, it also makes it much more fun.\n\nBefore I get ahead of myself, let’s just recap the results: a longer range of motion seems to be the way to go for … everything, at least in this study. When I thought about it for a moment, I realized that the key studies people generally cite to support the concept of range of motion specificity use the squat (3) or single joint exercises (4), rather than the bench press.\n\nWhat about the bench press specifically? There are three other relevant studies, but only one of them tested strength through multiple ranges of motion. Clark et al compared the effects of benching through a full ROM against benching through a variable ROM (a combination of full reps, ¼ reps, ½ reps, and ¾ reps; 5). Neither group experienced significant increases in force output through a full range of motion (which calls into question the usefulness of the training program used in the study), but the variable ROM group had a larger increase in force output through a ½ rep ROM. Two studies by Massey et al were nearly identical, except that one of the studies used male participants (6) while the other used female participants (7). Both studies had three groups: one trained through a full range of motion, one group trained through a partial range of motion (not lowering the bar below the sticking point), and one group did half of their sets through a full ROM and half though a partial ROM. In both studies, full-ROM bench press strength was the only outcome measure. In the study on males, the full and partial ROM groups had similar increases in strength, while the group doing both full and partial reps tended to gain a bit less strength. In the study on females, on the other hand, the full ROM group had the largest increase in 1RM strength, while the partial ROM and mixed ROM groups had slightly smaller increases. Putting all four of these studies together, it becomes clear that doing full ROM training is important for building strength through a full ROM on bench press (benching through a full ROM built strength through a full ROM or through the bottom of the ROM as well as or better than all other conditions in all studies). However, ROM specificity isn’t as clearly supported. In the present study (1), benching through a full ROM built more strength through a partial ROM than benching through a partial ROM did. In the Clark study, while partials built more strength through the top part of the ROM, benching through a full ROM failed to increase strength off the chest to a greater degree than doing partials. In the Massey study on males, benching through a full ROM and doing partials proved equally effective for building strength through a full ROM. And finally, in the Massey study on females, the group using mixed ROMs (and thus still doing some training through a full ROM) failed to increase full ROM strength more than the group only doing partials. All in all, it’s a murky picture.\n\nSo, what might explain these results? If the principle of specificity is so well-supported, why does ROM specificity in the bench press look so iffy?\n\nMy first thought is that the magnitude of strength fluctuations throughout a full range of motion probably has an impact. In other words, are you 20% stronger at the top of a rep than at the bottom of a rep, or are you 100% stronger? In the case of squats, it’s not terribly uncommon to be able to lift WAY more for partials than for full reps. Speaking from experience, I’ve done quarter squats with 1000+lb when my 1RM through a full ROM was closer to ~650, and I’m sure that disparity would be even larger if I trained quarter squats with as much focus as I put into full ROM squats. With bench, on the other hand, there’s maybe a 15% difference between my full-ROM bench press and the heaviest weight I could use for high pin presses or board presses. The exact ratios may differ for you, but I’d be surprised if that same principle didn’t apply to almost everyone reading this: there’s a bigger gap between partial-ROM strength and full-ROM strength in the squat than in the bench press. By extension, one would then assume that full-ROM bench press would have a larger effect on partial-ROM bench press strength than full-ROM squatting would have on partial-ROM squat strength. If an appropriate load for full-ROM bench press is 200lb and an appropriate weight for partials is 230, doing reps at 200 is still probably heavy enough to do something for partial-ROM strength. However if an appropriate load for full-ROM squats is 400lb and an appropriate load for half squats is 650, doing full-ROM reps with 400 probably isn’t doing much to improve partial-ROM strength directly (beyond simply building more muscle mass). The opposite principle may also be true – you may get better carryover from partial-ROM training to full-ROM strength when the strength curve of a movement is flatter. Half reps on bench press feel more similar to full-ROM bench press than half reps on squat feel when compared to full-ROM squats. If you’ve ever converted an athlete from partial-ROM training to full-ROM training, you’ve probably seen this firsthand – their first session benching through a full ROM is a little humbling because they need to take some weight off the bar, but they still perform reasonably well, and the weights they can handle are at least somewhat comparable to the loads they were using before for partials, unless they were previously using a very partial ROM. With squats, on the other hand, shifting from half squats to full squats often requires a complete rebuild of their squatting mechanics, and necessitates slashing their training weights at least in half.\n\nIn the present study (1), another factor in play is how the subjects actually performed their reps. To keep ranges of motion consistent, the subjects benched to pins, allowing the bar to briefly rest on the pins between sets. This is a great way to ensure that the range of motion was consistent, but it possibly decreases ecological validity a bit. When you switch between the eccentric and concentric portions of a lift, if there’s not a physical impediment to help you decelerate the bar (i.e. the floor when deadlifting), you get a rather large spike in force output when transitioning between lowering the bar and explosively lifting the bar. Lowering the bar to pins negates that spike in force output. That does mirror the way that many people would do partial bench press reps (i.e. pin press or board press), but it may not capture all of the ways that someone could apply partial range of motion training when bench pressing (namely, simply reversing each rep yourself without touching your chest). It’s plausible that partial ROM exercises that require the athlete to actively decelerate and reverse the load build more partial ROM strength than exercises, like pin presses, that allow another physical object to decelerate the load.\n\nFinally, it’s important to think about these results conceptually, rather than simply accepting one study as the final word on the topic. We have good research indicating that longer ranges of motion tend to lead to more muscle growth (3, 8). Since the subjects weren’t very well-trained, they likely still had plenty of room to grow more muscle. Hypertrophy wasn’t assessed in this study, but I don’t think we’d be unjustified to assume that that full range of motion group likely experienced the most muscle growth. That could be enough to explain the superior gains in performance, even through partial ranges of motion. Reasoning by analogy, two studies on squatting and jump performance immediately come to mind. In one study on untrained lifters (3), deep squats led to greater improvements in jump height than half squats (the positioning of half squats more closely mirrors jumping mechanics than the positioning of full squats). In another study on high level athletes (9), half squats led to larger improvements in jump height than full squats. In my opinion, the most likely explanation is that for untrained or semi-trained athletes, more hypertrophy can occur, and that muscular development can lead to robust performance improvements. For highly trained lifters, on the other hand, much less hypertrophy can occur, so optimizing for movement specificity rather than hypertrophy leads to larger performance improvements. Thus, if this study was repeated on trained lifters, I would expect that specificity would apply to a greater degree, with the full ROM group having the largest strength gains through a full ROM, the ⅔ ROM group having the largest strength gains through a ⅔ ROM, and the ⅓ ROM group having the largest strength gains through a ⅓ ROM.\n\nFinally, I’d just like to touch on something the authors of the present study mention in their discussion (1). They propose that powerlifters are actually training the bench press through a partial range of motion, due to arching, taking a wide grip, and specifically aiming to minimize range of motion, and that they may be able to gain more strength if they did more of their training through a purposefully longer range of motion. I think that’s an idea worth at least considering. Based on competition definition, a “full” range of motion is any range of motion that allows the bar to touch your chest and lock out, as long as your grip width doesn’t exceed 81cm. But is that REALLY a full range of motion biomechanically? I’d argue that it isn’t. For example, a close grip bench with a smaller arch involves more elbow flexion, and a greater combination of shoulder extension and horizontal abduction than a typical competition-style bench, so your prime movers clearly aren’t going through their full range of motion with a wide-grip, arched bench press. Is it possible that optimizing technique for short-term performance could actually limit long-term development, assuming you do most of your bench press training with a competition-style set-up? I certainly think it’s possible. For what it’s worth, that matches my experience (I always tend to make better bench progress when I’m doing a lot of cambered bar bench or close-grip bench with a smaller arch). It matches the anecdote of Mike MacDonald, who may be the most successful bench presser of all time; he simultaneously held the bench press records in four different weight classes at one point and swore by cambered bar bench press. More recently, Josh Bryant’s lifters have been very successful on the bench press, while primarily benching with pretty narrow grip widths (at least by powerlifting standards). Jeremy Hoornstra and Julius Maddox are his two most successful lifters, owning the all-time bench press records at 242, 275, and superheavyweight. At the very least, if your bench press is plateaued, I think it’s worth considering doing some of your weekly bench press training with a technique that allows for a longer range of motion.\n\nNext Steps\n\nI’d like to see more research looking at range of motion specificity in a wider array of exercises and in more advanced lifters. I’d also like to see a training study in powerlifters comparing a training program consisting solely of wide grip bench against a training program with pressing volume split evenly between wide-grip bench and close-grip bench.\n\nApplication and Takeaways\n\nWhile the principle of specificity is a cornerstone of training theory, it’s important to remember that it’s a principle, not an iron-clad law. Specifically, range of motion specificity may not hold up quite as well in the bench press as in the squat. For long-term strength development, benching through a longer range of motion than your competition-style setup may be worth a shot if you plateau.\n\n[feature_box style=”4″ only_advanced=”There%20are%20no%20title%20options%20for%20the%20choosen%20style” alignment=”center”]\n\nThe latest research – interpreted and delivered every month\n\nIf you want to stay up-to-date on the research pertinent to strength and physique athletes and coaches, but you don’t have the time or desire to develop the skill set to critically analyze research, you can sign up for Monthly Applications in Strength Sport (MASS), the monthly research review I put out every month, along with Dr. Eric Trexler, Dr. Eric Helms, and Dr. Mike Zourdos.\n\nEach issue of MASS contains at least 10 pieces of content like this.

The difference is that mean propulsive velocity trims off the end of each concentric when the bar decelerates prior to lockout before calculating average velocity, whereas mean concentric velocity is a measure of velocity for the entire concentric portion of each rep. At high loads, mean propulsive velocity and mean concentric velocity are similar. At low loads, mean propulsive velocity is a bit faster than mean concentric velocity since the bar needs more deceleration prior to lockout. For the purposes of this study, the differences don’t really matter, since both are valid and reliable measures and convey nearly identical information.\nBloomquist K, Langberg H, Karlsen S, Madsgaard S, Boesen M, Raastad T. Effect of range of motion in heavy load squatting on muscle and tendon adaptations. Eur J Appl Physiol. 2013 Aug;113(8):2133-42.\nValamatos MJ, Tavares F, Santos RM, Veloso AP, Mil-Homens P. Influence of full range of motion vs. equalized partial range of motion training on muscle architecture and mechanical properties. Eur J Appl Physiol. 2018 Sep;118(9):1969-1983.\nClark RA, Humphries B, Hohmann E, Bryant AL. The influence of variable range of motion training on neuromuscular performance and control of external loads. J Strength Cond Res. 2011 Mar;25(3):704-11.\nMassey CD, Vincent J, Maneval M, Moore M, Johnson JT. An analysis of full range of motion vs. partial range of motion training in the development of strength in untrained men. J Strength Cond Res. 2004 Aug;18(3):518-21.\nMassey CD, Vincent J, Maneval M, Johnson JT. Influence of range of motion in resistance training in women: early phase adaptations. J Strength Cond Res. 2005 May;19(2):409-11.\nMcMahon GE, Morse CI, Burden A, Winwood K, Onambélé GL. Impact of range of motion during ecologically valid resistance training protocols on muscle size, subcutaneous fat, and strength. J Strength Cond Res. 2014 Jan;28(1):245-55.\nRhea, M., Kenn, J., Peterson, M., et al. Joint-Angle Specific Strength Adaptations Influence Improvements in Power in Highly Trained Athletes. Human Movement, 2016, 17(1), pp. 43-49.\n\n \n\nGreg Nuckols\nGreg Nuckols has over a decade of experience under the bar, a BS in Exercise and Sports Science, and a Master's in Exercise Physiology.
