    "content": "I'm excited to launch the first direct-to-consumer mitochondrial respiratory chain analysis and you can order it ​here​.\n\nI have spent the last year and a half doing incredibly labor-intensive analysis of comprehensive genomic and biochemical data to supercharge some of my VIP clients and I've seen some incredible results:\n\nJulie spent seven years getting IVF treatments with no success except a quickly miscarried \"chemical pregnancy.\" Just months after starting her protocol she for the first time developed a healthy pregnancy.\n\nJulie spent seven years getting IVF treatments with no success except a quickly miscarried \"chemical pregnancy.\" Just months after starting her protocol she for the first time developed a healthy pregnancy.\n\nOne of my clients was so tired she could barely go on walks. Weeks after adding the first supplement in her protocol (biotin) she was going on runs.\n\nOne of my clients was so tired she could barely go on walks. Weeks after adding the first supplement in her protocol (biotin) she was going on runs.\n\nOne customer whose child has severe OCD saw \"the first positive improvement for many years\" within the second week of the program and for the first time ever her child admitted himself that he was getting better.\n\nOne customer whose child has severe OCD saw \"the first positive improvement for many years\" within the second week of the program and for the first time ever her child admitted himself that he was getting better.\n\nThese analyses take so much time that I wanted to reflect on how I could help a much larger number of people much faster.\n\nI asked this simple question: if I were to choose one item from among all the things I test that has the greatest opportunity to get high-impact results for people all on its own, which would I pick? The answer was clear: my analysis of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is where 90% of your ATP is made, and this test can evaluate not simply how well your mitochondria works but can also tell you where your weakest link is. In numerous cases, I was able to give people simple strategies based on this test alone that led to game-changing results.\n\nFor example:\n\nJacqueline hadn't had her period for ten years, even though she was only 28 years old when it stopped. Her respiratory chain results showed CoQ10 was the missing bottleneck in her ATP production. Just two weeks after starting CoQ10, she got her period back.\n\nJacqueline hadn't had her period for ten years, even though she was only 28 years old when it stopped. Her respiratory chain results showed CoQ10 was the missing bottleneck in her ATP production. Just two weeks after starting CoQ10, she got her period back.\n\nAnother client showed a pattern that indicated CoQ10 wouldn’t be able to to perform its normal function in sulfur clearance, but a CoQ10 analog called MitoQ would. CoQ10 had been unable to stop his daily energy crashes, but two capsules of MitoQ twice a day quickly eliminated them.\n\nAnother client showed a pattern that indicated CoQ10 wouldn’t be able to to perform its normal function in sulfur clearance, but a CoQ10 analog called MitoQ would. CoQ10 had been unable to stop his daily energy crashes, but two capsules of MitoQ twice a day quickly eliminated them.\n\nFor a year after chemotherapy, Anita struggled with deep fatigue, brain fog, and scars that did not heal completely. When her respiratory chain results came in, I gave her some custom recommendations. In her own words, \"The resulting surge of energy allowed me to start a strength training program, replacing muscle lost to muscle atrophy from chemotherapy. Scarring from treatment that was static for over a year completely healed and autoimmune issues settled down.\"\n\nFor a year after chemotherapy, Anita struggled with deep fatigue, brain fog, and scars that did not heal completely.

In her own words, \"The resulting surge of energy allowed me to start a strength training program, replacing muscle lost to muscle atrophy from chemotherapy. Scarring from treatment that was static for over a year completely healed and autoimmune issues settled down.\"\n\nMiguel suffered from post-SSRI tachycardia, shortness of breath, neuropathy, sexual dysfunction, anxiety, muscle cramping, numbness, excessive urination. He saw dozens of specialists, who couldn't help him. His respiratory chain results came in, and within six weeks of implementing the major insight we got, he reported \"the first time I felt normal in over two years.\" He wrote to me recently, \"6 months later, I have regained quality of life and am able to do everything I used to be able to.\"\n\nMiguel suffered from post-SSRI tachycardia, shortness of breath, neuropathy, sexual dysfunction, anxiety, muscle cramping, numbness, excessive urination.

The variation in CoQ10 needs are such that the same dose can lower blood pressure in some people but raise it in a few percent, or help improve blood sugar dramatically in some people but cause a 5-unit rise in fasting insulin in the majority. It can can worsen spatial memory and age-related hearing loss in mice, and in some people cause idiosyncratic reactions such as orthostatic hypotension (faintness upon standing), acid reflux, heart palpitations, and hypocalcemia. Actually knowing whether you need CoQ10 based on the results of a high-precision advanced test is incredibly valuable. Further, there are no studies showing CoQ10 reverses decades-long amenorrhea. This was a highly idiosyncratic power-up predicted by the testing.\n\nTo add to all of this, despite the marketing, MitoQ is not a “form of CoQ10.” In fact, it can’t fulfill most of CoQ10’s functions, and it generates hydrogen peroxide at the expense of ATP. This is not something you want to add in randomly. It’s something you want to add because you know you need it.\n\nAs a result of this overwhelming benefit, I developed ​Mitome​, the first direct-to-consumer mitochondrial respiratory chain analysis:\n\nMitome measures your mitochondria using a cheek swab and a batch of lab tests that are not available anywhere in a direct-to-consumer product.\n\nMitome measures your mitochondria using a cheek swab and a batch of lab tests that are not available anywhere in a direct-to-consumer product.\n\nMy unique analysis of this data categorizes you into a unique pattern, using the individual enzyme system results, their combinations, and their ratios.\n\nMy unique analysis of this data categorizes you into a unique pattern, using the individual enzyme system results, their combinations, and their ratios.\n\nSome of these patterns may be combined, leading to further unique combinations.\n\nSome of these patterns may be combined, leading to further unique combinations.\n\nThis then assembles a protocol for you based on which patterns you exemplify, using foods, supplements, environmental exposures and medications, and lifestyle strategies.\n\nThis then assembles a protocol for you based on which patterns you exemplify, using foods, supplements, environmental exposures and medications, and lifestyle strategies.\n\nYour report is a graphically rich explanation of your results, what they mean, how they make you unique, and how they impact your requirements.

    "title": "The Father of Evidence-Based Medicine: Why N=1 Trials Top the Evidence Hierarchy",
    "content": "Gordon Guyatt coined the term “Evidence-Based Medicine” in 1991 and together with David Sackett and others he founded the EBM movement, formally proclaimed in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 1992.\n\nHe cofounded the GRADE Working Group in 2000, which has now become embedded in the World Health Organization, Cochrane, and other institutions as the authoritative distribution of EBM’s influence in the world’s institutions.\n\nHe started the authoritative textbook on EBM, Users Guide to the Medical Literature, in 2001, which reached its third edition in 2014 and remains the authority of the field.\n\nAs such there is no one else alive who speaks more authoritatively on what Evidence-Based Medicine truly means.\n\nYou may then be surprised that the familiar “pyramid” of the “evidence hierarchy,” which appears to have been created by an entirely unknown reference librarian at SUNY Downstate in 1997, is, according to Guyatt “totally confused.”\n\nAmong other reasons, properly conducted n=1 self-experiments belong at the TOP of the hierarchy, where they have appeared in the EBM textbook since 2001, remaining so in the 2014 edition. Guyatt told me that if he ever produced a fourth edition, n=1 trials would remain right at the top.\n\nWe looked together at my own randomized n=1 self-experiment comparing the impact of corn vs quinoa on my sleep and energy.\n\nYou may also be quite surprised at how Guyatt described the importance of mechanistic reasoning in interpreting the generalizability of human outcome studies. In some cases, it’s “crucial.”\n\nWe talked about how I synthesize mechanistic reasoning, animal studies, and human trials to interpret the way choline status should impact the effect of seed oils on fatty liver and Guyatt weighs in with his verdict on my reasoning.\n\nIn this interview, Guyatt and I discuss how to apply the principles of EBM to medicine, health and nutrition, and daily life, paying special attention to the less appreciated aspects of EBM, like the importance of individual values and choice, recognizing what we don’t know, understanding the limits of generalizing from RCTs, weighing mechanistic reasoning against observational studies as means of navigating uncertainty, and how Guyatt responds to critiques from public health and to John Ioannidis’s claim that EBM has been hijacked.\n\n0:29 What was medicine based on before it was based on evidence?\n3:29 What is EBM?\n5:38 How individual choice is core to EBM but remains underappreciated, and how it took time for it to become a core part of EBM.\n10:50 Why the “hierarchy of evidnce” pyramid is “totally confused.”\n19:08 Why n=1 trials are at the TOP of the evidence hierarchy\n25:09 What might change his mind on statins?\n29:15 My own n=1 randomized experiment of corn vs quinoa\n33:27 Do randomized controlled trials apply to individual people?\n36:06 What is the role of “try it and see if it works” in EBM?\n37:38 What is the role of mechanistic reasoning in extrapolating from randomized trials?\n46:51 Guyatt evaluates how I synthesize mechanistic reasoning and animal experiments with human trial results to interpret the likely impact of choline status on how seed oils versus saturated fats impact fatty liver disease.\n56:08 Does the fact that RCTs aren’t long enough mean that long observational studies can be high-quality evidence?\n1:01:08 Whether the upcoming revisions to the GRADE framework are inappropriately reducing skepticism toward observational studies\n1:07:31 How he responds to criticisms from public health\n1:09:39 Is EBM in “crisis” and has it been “hijacked”?\n\nSubtitle: My interview with Gordon Guyatt\n\nDescription: My interview with Gordon Guyatt",

    "content": "This is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nBlood cholesterol levels, along with LDL particle count, ApoB concentration, LDL particle size, LDL pattern, and the ratio of cholesterol between LDL and HDL are all governed centrally by the LDL receptor.\n\nGenetic mutations in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolemia by lowering LDL receptor expression. One in a million people are born with homozygous mutations, and this can cause heart attacks as young as 18 months old. One in 300 people are born with heterozygous mutations, which shifts heart disease forward from a phenomenon that primarily kills between the age of 60 to 80 to one that primarily kills between the ages of 35 and 60.\n\nThe LDL receptor is the main way you bring cholesterol from outside the cell to inside the cell. While the liver only makes about 16% of the body's cholesterol, it is overwhelmingly responsible for controlling the concentration of cholesterol in the blood by taking it up using the LDL receptor. That cholesterol can then be put to productive use, especially for the synthesis of bile acids to support digestion.\n\nHowever, there are two primary governors of LDL receptor production:\n\nThyroid hormone governs it by signaling abundance. This causes the liver to take up more cholesterol than it needs to meet its basic needs, and this is what drives bile acid production to support digestion.\n\nThyroid hormone governs it by signaling abundance. This causes the liver to take up more cholesterol than it needs to meet its basic needs, and this is what drives bile acid production to support digestion.\n\nCholesterol deficiency within the liver cell governs it by signaling scarcity. The liver takes up cholesterol from the blood not to put it to productive use but simply to replenish its own stores.\n\nCholesterol deficiency within the liver cell governs it by signaling scarcity. The liver takes up cholesterol from the blood not to put it to productive use but simply to replenish its own stores.\n\nStatins work by inducing a cholesterol deficiency in the liver. The liver responds to this by taking up more from the blood to bring its stores back up to normal.\n\nIn his 1976 book, Solved: The Riddle of Heart Attacks, Broda Barnes reviewed the history of using thyroid hormone to control both cholesterol levels and heart disease risk. It worked extremely well, but it was discontinued due to what Barnes describes as irresponsible dosing that had killed a few people.\n\nIt is important to understand here that you do not need to be “hypothyroid” for thyroid hormone to lower your cholesterol. It will work at any dose. Practitioners using it did not realize they were playing with fire by using a hormone to signal a degree of abundance that was not present in the body. Thus, some of them let the dosing get out of hand because it had nothing necessarily to do with correcting a thyroid deficiency.\n\nNevertheless, their approach was the same as using statins because both thyroid hormone and statins increase the LDL receptor.\n\nOn the other hand, it was the opposite, because thyroid signals abundance while statins signal scarcity.\n\nWhat everyone involved fails to fundamentally understand is that your LDL receptor does not work in a vacuum. It is powered by mitochondrial ATP production.\n\nIf your mitochondria are not working well, your LDL receptor simply will not work.\n\nDoctors who use a pharma-first approach have little respect for nature and doctors who use a statin-first, mitochondria-never approach do so because they do not understand the most basic elements of cellular biology.\n\nAs covered in What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health, everyone must use a food-first, pharma-last approach, which means everyone needs their doctor to follow the same approach. Do your research until you find a good one.\n\nHow Mitochondria Power Your LDL Receptor\n\nAs shown in this diagram from Alberts, Molecular Biology of the Cell, the “Bible” of molecular and cellular biology, the LDL receptor clears cholesterol from the blood by binding to LDL particles on the cell surface.\n\nThey are present in the membrane bound to the green protein, clathrin, which helps facilitate the membrane invaginating and pinching off to form a vesicle. The protein coat must then be removed, and the vesicle fuses with an organelle known as the endosome, which then uses the digestive organelle known as the lysosome to eat up the contents, digest them, and release the cholesterol.\n\nThe figure below shows more detail:\n\nThe protein dynamin squeezes the invagination to pinch it off from the cell membrane.\n\nHave you ever tried to squeeze anything without investing energy into it? Here’s something you could try: buy a dynamometer and see what your grip strength is when you feel most awake and energetic. Then try it just before you go to bed, immediately upon waking, or after you finish a grueling workout.\n\nNo energy? No squeeze.\n\nDynamin is powered by the hydrolysis of GTP, ATP’s close cousin. In fact, GTP production is directly fueled by ATP, so without mitochondrial ATP production dynamin won’t function.\n\nPut all the LDL receptors in your membrane you want. If the vesicle can’t squeeze off, the cholesterol is staying in your blood.\n\nContrary to what some of us learned in high school biology, cells are not sacs of fluid. Things don’t come in and then just float around. They are highly organized microcosms of civilization, with several classes of proteins making up their structural infrastructure and transport superhighways known as the “cytoskeleton.”\n\nThe two major cytoskeletal proteins involved in LDL uptake are actin (red) and microtubules (blue).\n\nActin filaments organize themselves around the invagination to provide structural support to it. They interact with it using myosin VI. This protein is in the same family as the myosin II that performs skeletal muscle contraction. It is directly powered by ATP.\n\nThe microtubules make up the transport superhighway network within the cell that, in this case, facilitates the newly formed vesicle moving toward the endosome. The motor proteins that power movement along the microtubules are dynein and various kinesins, which are directly powered by ATP.\n\nNot shown in the figure, the uncoating of the vesicle is performed by heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), which, like every other heat-shock protein, is directly powered by ATP.\n\nThus, every LDL receptor that brings an LDL particle in from your blood requires five different classes of ATP-dependent protein to actually move it from the blood into the cell.\n\nNo mitochondrial ATP?\n\nNo LDL receptor activity.\n\nHow Mitochondria Power Your Thyroid Hormone\n\nAs I covered in Hormones Are Never In Charge, thyroid hormone is primarily regulated by mitochondrial ATP production.\n\nCaloric intake, especially carbohydrate, drives the pancreas to make insulin and the adipose tissue to make leptin. Adipose production of leptin is at baseline proportional to the total fat stored, so insulin is a gauge of short-term energy status and leptin is primarily a gauge of long-term energy status.\n\nHowever, these hormones are not directly stimulated by carbs and calories. They are stimulated instead by mitochondrial conversion of food to ATP.\n\nInsulin and leptin both act on the hypothalamus to increase thyroid hormone-releasing hormone (TRH). They do so by increasing ATP production in the hypothalamus.\n\nInsulin and TRH both act together on the thyroid gland to increase the output of thyroid hormone.\n\nThus, any impairment in mitochondrial ATP production will hurt thyroid hormone production.\n\nConversely, efficient mitochondrial conversion of food to ATP will drive thyroid hormone secretion because it serves as a highly accurate signal of true energetic abundance.\n\nOptimal Mitochondrial Function Optimizes Blood Lipids\n\nThus, optimal mitochondrial ATP production exerts a concerted effect on thyroid hormone to increase the LDL receptor and on the five ATP-dependent motor proteins that help bring the LDL particles into the cell.\n\nWhat happens when you intervene to pump up the LDL receptor without creating the actual abundance necessary for its proper function?\n\nOn the one hand, it will not work as well as it would if ATP were abundant.\n\nOn the other hand, more LDL receptors will try to use up more ATP, so they will take it from what is available, which will make less available for other things.\n\nSuch a solution is like seeing an oil shortage and solving it by importing more cars. Will you incentivize more driving? Yes, you will. Most likely, more people will get from A to B. But now you’ve driven up home heating prices for people who heat their homes with oil, so now you’ll have more people with hypothermia, hypertension, cardiovascular and respiratory problems, and misery.\n\nIn other words, you are definitely causing cholesterol to move from your blood to your cells. But at what cost? You are draining your ATP supply and problems are just going to pop up somewhere else.\n\nStatins Are Mitochondrial Toxins\n\nStatins induce cholesterol deficiency in liver cells by impairing the production of mevalonate, a compound far upstream from cholesterol.\n\nMevalonate is used to produce many different compounds, but two that are central to mitochondrial function are CoQ10 and heme A.\n\nHeme A is the specific iron-based protein that facilitates the use of the oxygen to convert food to ATP in the mitochondria.\n\nBy decreasing ATP production, statins hurt methylation. This is because ATP is used to make methylfolate and to activate methionine to S-adenosyl-methionine, the universal methyl donor.\n\nMethylation is needed to produce all mitochondrial proteins. Since methylation is needed to make ATP and ATP is needed for methylation, a decline in methylation that feeds back on mitochondrial ATP production will initiate a vicious cycle.\n\nMethylation is needed to produce creatine, and this is probably why statins decrease creatine synthesis.\n\nCreatine is the mitochondrial power grid. It spreads the impact of mitochondrial ATP production throughout the cell, especially in the general area of the cell known as the cytosol.\n\nIt is in the cytosol where S-adenosyl-methionine is made, so creatine supports its production and a decline in creatine status will compromise methylation in a vicious cycle.\n\nThus, by the time low ATP is hurting methylation beyond a certain threshold, you’ve locked in a vicious supercycle composed of multiple vicious cycles that will cause perpetually declining mitochondrial function.\n\nYou now have less ATP and less creatine, which are two hits against LDL receptor activity, even though you have increased the production of that receptor.\n\nTo take this back to our oil analogy, this is worse than importing cars to deal with an oil shortage. Rather, this is denying drilling permits so that the supply of oil gets cut in half, then diverting half the oil left over into importing those cars. Now you increase demand after you’ve already decreased supply. You still get more people getting from A to B, but your heating oil shortage has gotten a lot worse and you should probably prepare for a popular revolt among the poor whose children are frostbit and whose grandparents are dying.\n\nIn other words, you are hurting the total supply of ATP but diverting what ATP you have toward LDL receptor function. It works to lower cholesterol, but at the cost of other processes that need cellular energy, which is… all of them.\n\nCoQ10 Is Not Sufficient to Prevent or Reverse Statin Myopathy\n\nStatins can cause muscle pain and cramps that can get bad enough in a small number of people to cause exercise intolerance and even rhabdomyolysis. “Rhabdo” is a result of muscle damage that causes muscle proteins to turn the urine a dark color.\n\nAs reviewed here, clinical trials only show this happening in 1.5-3% of people, whereas observational studies show that it occurs in 7-38% of people.\n\nThe discrepancy can be explained by the fact that people who sign up for clinical trials are healthier than the general population, the trials screen for vulnerability to side effects far more strictly than doctors do for their patients, and you can control the incidence by how strictly you define myopathy. For example, if you count people who have an increase in unexplained cramping, you will get a large number, and if you only count people whose rhabdo put them in the ER you will get a small number.\n\nMeta-analyses conflict as to whether CoQ10 does absolutely nothing or helps substantially with statin-induced myopathy. For example, a 2022 meta-analysis concluded CoQ10 does nothing, and a 2025 meta-analysis concluded that 100-600 milligrams per day has a very helpful effect.\n\nAlthough the 2025 analysis is more recent, only a single 2022 trial contributing to 16% of the result was published after the 2022 meta-analysis was prepared. The primary difference between the two is that the 2022 meta-analysis required creatine kinase data to verify the myopathy and only included placebo-controlled trials whereas the 2025 meta-analysis required only a survey of muscle pain and included trials that were not placebo-controlled.\n\nRegardless, even if we treat the 2025 analysis charitably, it indicates that CoQ10 is only partially effective. For example, if the subjects reported a muscle pain score of 5-6, CoQ10 would reduce this by 2.5 points, which indicates it could roughly cut the muscle pain in half.\n\nCutting it in half is good, but if that’s where the result ends, it isn’t a resolution. Moreover, if the vicious supercycle of declining mitochondrial function has not been reversed, it is likely to keep getting worse after the trial is over.\n\nCreatine supplementation has led to the complete resolution of statin myopathy in some cases, but has only been studied in 13 people, published in a case series and a case report.\n\nMetabolomic analysis of statin-associated myopathy cases shows that there are broad shifts in energy metabolism that cannot be attributed to any one single cause and are idiosyncratic between patients. For example, there is a broad shift away from branched-chain amino acid metabolism and toward arginine and proline metabolism, which I suspect reflects impairment in the conversion of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) to the energy carrier coenzyme A (CoA) as a secondary side effect of the vicious supercycle. There is a broad shift toward altered glycine and serine metabolism, which I suspect reflects impaired methylation. Some people have increased carnitine synthesis and others have decreased carnitine synthesis, showing that the mitochondrial dysfunction is idiosyncratic.\n\nIt is possible that some interventions like CoQ10 and creatine can in some people break one or two of the vicious cycles enough to interrupt the vicious supercycle, but neither of these are going to normalize the production of heme A.\n\nThere is no supplement that can reverse the inhibition of heme A synthesis, which means nothing can resolve the fact that statins will impair your mitochondrial utilization of oxygen to produce ATP.\n\nMitome Can Examine What Is Unique to You\n\nAs the Founder and Scientific Director of Mitome, I embedded in the reporting the ability to differentiate between impairments in CoQ10-mediated processes, signatures that methylation deficiency is impairing mitochondrial function, and the impact of inadequate complex IV activity that would be caused by a disruption in heme A.\n\nMitome directly tests the respiratory chain components, where disruptions of CoQ10 and heme A synthesis would first be found, and thus looks at the root cause of the mitochondrial vicious supercycle.\n\nIf removal of statins and supplementation with CoQ10 and creatine do not resolve statin myopathy, Mitome could determine what is still missing and what to do about it.\n\nMitome is not meant to diagnose or treat disease and has not been clinically tested in statin-associated myopathy.\n\nHowever, it can reveal what the unique limitation in your mitochondrial function is and provide you with an actionable protocol to address it with food and supplements.\n\nWhy Mitochondria Must Come First\n\nIf you optimize your mitochondrial function, you promote robust thyroid hormone activity to increase your LDL receptor production, and you promote robust supply of mitochondrial ATP production to make the five motor proteins needed for LDL receptor activity do their job.\n\nYou also need to be eating enough protein, iodine, and antioxidant nutrients to support your thyroid.\n\nTo examine your diet, use the guidelines in What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health, track your micronutrients in Cronometer, and run the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening.\n\nIf your cholesterol or LDL-C or ApoB or whatever you are measuring remains concerningly high despite adequate micronutrients, and you have also followed the guidelines in What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health regarding body composition and stress management, you should experiment with fiber, your fat-to-carbohydrate ratio, and your intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.\n\nIn general you need to get your BMI to 18-25 or more precisely optimize your body fat, and, in that context, push your carbohydrates up to a point that does not destabilize your glucose and lactate numbers or make you regain body fat.\n\nMore fiber will, in general, help lower cholesterol, but your fiber intake should also be adjusted to what promotes optimal digestion and stool function.\n\nIf you have chronic inflammation that is not attributable to excess body fat, you can try a short 12-week course of any of the following, alone or combined: 3 capsules of cod liver oil and 6 capsules of fish oil for high-dose omega-3s; boswellia; 250-2500 milligrams of Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators; 1000 milligrams once or twice per day of black seed oil; or 1.2 grams (3 capsules) of curcumin as Biocurcumax; or the lactoferrin protocol.\n\nIf these do not resolve your blood lipid problem you can try restricting saturated fat, focused on the foods that provide you with the least important micronutrients. You can compare this to restricting cholesterol, again focused on restricting the foods with the least important micronutrients. You can combine these if they both seem to work. While replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat will work, I do not consider it wise.\n\nIf after all this you still need to work on your blood lipids you could consider a statin. It may in fact be optimal in certain extreme cases.\n\nHowever, you should always use a food-first, pharma-last approach to everything, and you should always use a mitochondria-first, statin-last approach to blood lipids.\n\nIf you optimize your mitochondria first and you still need more LDL receptor activity, then by the time you intervene, the LDL receptor will be using the most abundant supply of ATP you were able to provide it with.\n\nIf instead you use statins — unambiguous mitochondrial toxins — as your first approach, you are killing the ATP supply and then making the LDL receptor take what little there is from the rest of your functions that need it.\n\nIt is unlikely that even the most rose-colored clinical trials and case reports are telling the full story. On average, you lose 1% of your mitochondrial function per year. While 100-600 milligrams of CoQ10 or 5 grams of creatine per day may be very helpful in statin-associated myopathy, will that be true ten years after the study was completed when mitochondrial function has another decade worth of decline under its belt? I doubt it.\n\nAge only explains 25% of mitochondrial function, which means that 75% is in your power to optimize.\n\nFocus on getting incredible mitochondria first so you don’t have to try figuring out the cause of mitochondrial failure later.\n\nSubtitle: And CoQ10 isn't enough to fix this.\n\nDescription: And CoQ10 isn't enough to fix this.",

    "title": "How to Taper off SSRIs",
    "content": "About 29 million American adults, adolescents, and children are on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In many countries globally some 5-10% of the population are on SSRIs. These have become the first-line treatment for depression.\n\nSSRIs can cause sexual dysfunction and emotional blunting in up to half of people, an unclear incidence of sleep disruption, and a rare risk of suicidality, self-harm, and new-onset psychosis.\n\nGetting off SSRIs can cause discontinuation syndrome in 20-50% of people. It is more common, more severe, and lasts longer when people have been SSRIs for years instead of weeks or months. Many of the discontinuation symptoms represent new-onset dysfunction that cannot be explained by the withdrawal of an effective treatment for the pre-existing depression, such as headache, derealization, depersonalization, cramps, gait abnormalities, and “brain zaps.”\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nMy SSRI series led to the conclusion that serotonin’s primary role in the entire body is to coordinate mitochondrial energy production according to shifts in oxygen demand, that SSRIs are primarily mitochondrial drugs, that SSRIs can cause direct and severe mitochondrial toxicity in a small number of people, and that SSRI withdrawal causes new-onset mitochondrial dysfunction in a large number of people.\n\nMany people asked how to transition from SSRIs to using my Depression Protocol, which is a drug-free approach to depression.\n\nWhat to Do About SSRI Withdrawal Mitochondrial Dysfunction was meant for helping people who experience SSRI discontinuation syndrome or have been experiencing it for a very protracted length. One of its points, however, was that, as long as you’ve been on the drug for more than six to eight weeks, you want the taper to be as slow as possible.\n\nWhile I am not a medical doctor and cannot manage anyone’s medications, here are some insights derived from the literature about how to make the taper slow, and, most importantly, hyperbolic. Hyperbolic means you don’t go down the same number of milligrams each time; instead, you go down in smaller and smaller increments as you go on.\n\nMark Horowitz of the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, Australia, and David Taylor of Kings College London Institute of Pharmaceutical Science published a paper on this topic in 2019.\n\nThey pointed out that as the dose of an SSRI goes up, the modeled occupancy of the serotonin transporter levels off:\n\nThe figure below shows the impact of a linear dose reduction on the top and a hyperbolic dose reduction on the bottom.\n\nWhen you reduce the dose linearly, your early reductions have a very small impact on transporter occupancy and your later dose reductions have a massive impact.\n\nIf you want to achieve a smooth, even reduction in transporter inhibition, you need to make large dose reductions at first, and then progressively smaller and smaller dose reductions as you move on in the taper.\n\nThey modeled the range of speeds that could be used, where ten percent of people can taper off in six weeks or fewer, 10 percent of people take longer than eight months, and the median person takes 18 weeks.\n\nIn the hypothetical case they gave, the person starts on the median trajectory, but experiences discontinuation symptoms after several dose reductions, so she shifts over to the slower trajectory meant for the 70th percentile.\n\nHenricus Ruhe and colleagues of the Dutch Discontinuation of Antidepressants Task Force replied to their paper with a useful table that models 9- and 10-step taper protocols representing 10% reductions in transporter inhibition per step for the various SSRI and SNRIs:\n\nThey suggested that one could start with one week per step instead of the slower approach suggested by Horowitz and Taylor. If the patient reports discontinuation symptoms emerging, they can go back to the previous dose and taper more slowly.\n\nAnecdotally, I have heard of some people taking six months per step, dragging out the taper protocol to five years.\n\nHere is my suspicion:\n\nTake up to as long in the taper as you spent on the drug.\n\nThis is based on the literature I reviewed strongly suggesting that incidence, severity, and duration of discontinuation symptoms is driven by the time spent on the drug.\n\nHere is a simple way to approach this. I do not give out medical advice so this is an idea you can bring to your physician to help you get off these drugs if you decide to get off them:\n\nFollow the dose reduction pattern in the table.\n\nFollow the dose reduction pattern in the table.\n\nMake an initial plan for each step to take two weeks.\n\nMake an initial plan for each step to take two weeks.\n\nIf you experience new-onset problems as a result of the taper, go back to the dose prior to the emergence of those problems, and switch to a slower taper.\n\nIf you experience new-onset problems as a result of the taper, go back to the dose prior to the emergence of those problems, and switch to a slower taper.\n\nYou can also make the increment even smaller. For example, you could model the dose reduction after the next, smaller step. Or if you get to “0” in the table, you can replace it with half of the previous dose.\n\nYou can also make the increment even smaller. For example, you could model the dose reduction after the next, smaller step. Or if you get to “0” in the table, you can replace it with half of the previous dose.\n\nIf you switch to a slower taper you can at first expand it to three weeks, but you should strongly consider taking the entire time you spent on the SSRIs and dividing it by ten. For example, if you have been on SSRIs for eight years, this would be 416 weeks; divided by ten, this makes each step take 41.6 weeks. You could make it simpler by rounding up to 42 weeks, or even just go down one step per year.\n\nIf you switch to a slower taper you can at first expand it to three weeks, but you should strongly consider taking the entire time you spent on the SSRIs and dividing it by ten. For example, if you have been on SSRIs for eight years, this would be 416 weeks; divided by ten, this makes each step take 41.6 weeks. You could make it simpler by rounding up to 42 weeks, or even just go down one step per year.\n\nIf you require a slow taper, you could try the suggestions in What to Do About SSRI Withdrawal Mitochondrial Dysfunction to see if they can improve taper tolerance and allow you to go more quickly.\n\nIf you experience a return of depression but not other new problems, you can then use my Depression Protocol for a drug-free approach. In general, it is not contraindicated to mix SSRIs with anything in that protocol, but you should exercise caution with anything else impacting serotonin (e.g. 5-HTP) or monoamine oxidase (dodder, pomegranate, ellagic acid). If you require an extended taper, you should use the the “optimize it” version of the protocol with the assistance of medical supervision as you likely have idiosyncratic mitochondrial dysfunction as either a background vulnerability or as caused by the SSRIs themselves.\n\nHave experience with a successful taper?

    "content": "Latest Health Insight\n\nOne underappreciated way in which the entire pharmaceutic industry is completely at odds with nature is the concept of the “steady state.” When you dose a drug, you want to find the dose and frequency of administration that leads to a steady plasma level that neither rises nor falls because the drug is replaced at the rate it is leaving the body. This helps maintain it within a therapeutic window that is effective without being overtly toxic.\n\nThe problem is that nearly everything in nature is meant to be rhythmic and cyclical, not steady.\n\nThis probably underlies why SSRI withdrawal causes mitochondrial dysfunction: SSRIs press the gas pedal of adaptive mechanisms inside cells like sigma-1 receptor activation but they never let go. These are supposed to be stimulated rhythmically to allow for a cycle of stimulus and adaptation, just like exercise and recovery. The steady state pressure put on these systems causes a completely unnatural dependence of mitochondria on the drug that then holds people as captive prisoners.\n\nYou don’t need to put the pedal to the metal to cause harm. Just step on the gas pedal a little. If you keep your foot in the same place indefinitely, you have a 100% chance of getting into an accident.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThis Week’s Food Experiment\n\nThis week I’ve been testing: are lima beans the mitochondria’s friend or foe?\n\nOn the one hand, lima beans are overwhelmingly the richest food source of molybdenum, at least according to the scant literature. In Missing From the Databases: Molybdenum, I include data showing a shockingly low five grams of lima beans per day contain the official requirement for molybdenum. Liver, the only organ meat tested and the only animal food shown to be a good source of this mineral, requires 35 grams to provide the same amount.\n\nMolybdenum gets rid of sulfite, which you make yourself from the protein you eat. Sulfite is a mitochondrial toxin that inhibits numerous enzymes involved in mitochondrial energy production and poisons the mitochondria’s import/export infrastructure, causing them to lose control of what they take in and let out.\n\nOn the other hand, lima beans contain linamarin, a cyanogenic glycoside, meaning a sugar-bound molecule that releases cyanide. Cyanide binds to complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, preventing the mitochondria from using oxygen to produce ATP. This causes a backup in energy utilization that can raise blood glucose. Linamarin, in fact, has been shown to cause diabetes in undernourished dogs.\n\nWorse, inhibiting complex IV can increase sulfite production since this is part of the hypoxia response, thereby nullifying the benefit of the molybdenum.\n\nFurther, cyanide is detoxified to thiocyanate, which inhibits iodine uptake into the thyroid gland and thereby hurts mitochondrial energy production by means of downregulating it.\n\nI had been supplementing with 600 micrograms of molybdenum as Mo-Zyme for over a year, and I recently decided to test how much I would need from food alone to prevent my startle reflex from rising, which for me is a sign of molybdenum deficiency. This is driven by sulfite accumulation leading to the formation of S-sulfocysteine, an excitatory neurotransmitter that is relevant to everyone yet totally absent from neuroscience textbooks due to the completely erroneous but universal superstition that it is only relevant to rare diseases.\n\nMy experiment on the startle reflex is not over, but my preliminary results suggest that a quarter pound per day of US Wellness 75% Ground Beef With Heart, Kidney, and Liver keeps it normalized. When I reduced this to an eighth pound, below the threshold of startle reflex normalization, I titrated up lima beans in 5-gram-per-day increments, taking just under a month to increase from 5 to 35 grams per day. While each increase seemed to reduce my startle reflex, it felt like I was chasing it upward, having to eat more and more lima beans to keep it down as time went on.\n\nMy fasting blood glucose (measured with a KetoMojo) was 87 the day I first added 5 grams of lima beans. My blood glucose rose from 87 to a peak of 118 on 35 grams of lima beans, with the 3-day average reaching 110 the next day, and then it dropped to 89 in my second day after eliminating lima beans.\n\nMy lima bean dose during this period correlated to my blood glucose, explaining a whopping 43% of the variation, with a rise of 1 milligram per deciliter for every two grams of lima beans.\n\nIf I eliminate the first day of having removed lima beans, where the glucose had fallen to 102, and consider this day still “under the influence of lima beans,” the explanatory power rises from 43% to 50%.\n\nGiven that finger prick glucose is intrinsically variable, explanatory power of 43-50% is astronomical.\n\nI conclude that, for me, lima beans are a net mitochondrial toxin.\n\nFor more information on lima beans and other sources of cyanogenic glycosides, see Thyroid Toxins: Double-Edged Swords of the Kingdom Plantae.\n\nCoolest Paper I Read This Week\n\nAre common problems driven by rare bottlenecks?\n\nCommon Diseases In Clinical Cohorts — Not Always What They Seem is a paper in New England Journal of Medicine where genome sequencing was used in the UK Biobank and five randomized controlled trials to look for rare diseases in people already diagnosed and treated for common diseases like multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and atopic dermatitis.\n\nIn 2.86% of multiple sclerosis cases, their multiple sclerosis symptoms could be explained by a monogenic rare disease instead. Further, in these cases there was a 15-fold greater incidence of dementia than expected and a 3.5-fold greater incidence of convulsions.\n\n1.12% of IBD cases could be explained by rare monogenic diseases that hurt intestinal function, and 2.5% of atopic dermatitis could be explained by monogenic rare diseases that cause skin problems.\n\nThey uncovered some preliminary evidence that failing to diagnose the rare diseases may account for some failure of the patient to respond to treatments in randomized controlled trials.\n\nThis paper is really just uncovering the tip of the ice berg. It doesn’t consider synergistic heterozygosity, complex patterns of inheritance, or the fact that Energy Metabolism Governs Everything and therefore heterozygous bottlenecks in energy metabolism will by the laws of physics necessarily contribute to all diseases.\n\nIt suggests that 1-3% of common diagnoses are misdiagnoses but what it’s really hinting at is that all diagnoses are just models to predict treatment response and trying to overcategorize everything into a mirage of binary factual truth is useful until it isn’t, and its usefulness has already been exhausted.\n\nThe path foward to understanding unsolved or inadequately treated health problems will be to see them as complex patchworks of biochemical bottlenecks where fixing the weakest link in the biochemical chain will provide the greatest results on the path toward better health. That will always mean maximizing cellular energy production.\n\nWorst Scientific Practice I Found This Week\n\nThis is a case of hiding the control group.\n\nThis Egyptian paper testing whether Jarrow lactoferrin improves diabetes wins the award for this week. I like Jarrow as a brand, and it isn’t clear that they had any role in the study other than providing the product. At the special request of the investigators, they made a lactoferrin derived from camel milk, presumably to make it culturally relevant in Egypt. This makes it of unclear relevance to the US-sold Jarrow product but isn’t otherwise a bad practice.\n\nThe bad practice is this. They claim to have randomly allocated 60 obese children with diabetes to standard therapy with or without the Jarrow product while comparing their values to a set of 50 healthy controls.\n\nTheir tables show comparisons of values in 30 diabetics before lactoferrin, the same 30 after lactoferrin, and 30 controls. The result is that we wind up comparing the pre and post values in the 30 diabetics given lactoferrin. This is a very common form of statistical malpractice: the correct comparison in a randomized controlled trial is always the ending value between the treatment and control. This ensures you don’t wind up with conclusions fueled by statistical artifacts like regression to the mean.\n\nBut the problem is worse than usual. Are the 30 controls in the table the other 30 diabetics? Probably not, as we don’t have pre and post values for them. But if they are the healthy controls, why are there 30 and not 50 as stated? If they are the 30 diabetics not given lactoferrin, where did the 50 healthy controls go?\n\nResults like these show researchers are just cherry picking whatever will present their data in the best light, presumably because they didn’t like the way it looked when they analyzed it properly.\n\nWhen reading a paper, always make sure the full populations the authors claim to have studied have their data presented, that the comparisons are the ending values between the treatment and control rather than pre and post, and that any other adjustments or analyses are done after presenting the raw results in the most rigorous manner.\n\nMitome Story of the Week\n\nI recently talked to a Mitome customer who thought he might have started bonking at marathons because he was getting older. But his Mitome results showed his mitochondria were better fueled with fat than carbohydrate. This allowed him to think through his past results in new light. When he had used chocolate for his intra-marathon fuel, he never bonked. Only after transitioning to carb gels did he stop bonking. It turned out after this analysis his primary problem was a food science problem: how to get chocolate not to melt in his pocket during a marathon.\n\nOn the one hand, you might consider this a standard low-carb argument: if you train yourself to burn fat, you don’t have a problem running out of glycogen. But as I covered in Carbs and Sports Performance: The Principles and The Evidence, there are good reasons to think carbs are important to peak performance.\n\nAthletes that succeed on any given diet are self-selected, and the ones who self-select the wrong diet don’t win and get selected out of our attention.\n\nThe ability of mitochondria to run better on carbs versus fat is idiosyncratic, and using Mitome to learn which one best describes you can help you choose the fuel on which you can best perform.\n\nSubtitle: Edition 1: Pharma vs Nature, lima beans, common problems driven by rare bottlenecks, hiding the control group, and bonk-free marathons fueled by chocolate.\n\nDescription: Edition 1: Pharma vs Nature, lima beans, common problems driven by rare bottlenecks, hiding the control group, and bonk-free marathons fueled by chocolate.",

    "title": "Resolve Your Inflammation With This One Highly Unique Form of Lactoferrin",
    "content": "One of the most promising natural resolvers of inflammation is a milk-derived protein known as lactoferrin.\n\nAs we will see momentarily, however, not all lactoferrin is created equal.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nLactoferrin is naturally present in milk, saliva, vaginal secretions, semen, mucosal linings, and in polymorphonuclear leukocytes — neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils — involved in the immune response.\n\nThe immune system seems to release it to help bring iron into cells. Iron can feed some pathogens, so an infection drives interleukin-6 (IL-6) to drive lactoferrin release from immune cells and the production of the iron storage protein ferritin inside most cells. The lactoferrin helps bring the iron from the blood into the cells where it gets stored in the ferritin.\n\nLactoferrin is especially unique in its ability to pick up iron under acidic conditions such as the local sites of infections. It can therefore pick up free iron in infected tissue that the more everyday iron chaperone transferrin would not be able to pick up.\n\nSince lactoferrin accomplishes the mission of keeping iron safely hidden away from pathogens, it sends a “mission accomplished” signal to the immune system by suppressing the continued secretion of IL-6.\n\nThis means that for people who are chronically inflamed, lactoferrin — at least, the right type of lactoferrin — can help resolve the inflammation by bringing IL-6 back down to normal.\n\nEach molecule of lactoferrin can bind to two iron atoms, and each 100 milligrams of lactoferrin can bind to 3.57 milligrams of iron. The main dietary source of lactoferrin is milk. (Especially raw milk, since pasteurization destroys 65% of the lactoferrin). In milk, 15-20% of lactoferrin’s iron-binding sites are bound to iron. The portion bound to iron is known as holo-lactoferrin or iron-saturated lactoferrin, while the portion that is not bound to iron is called apo-lactoferrin.\n\nWhile all natural lactoferrin is a mix of the two, nearly all supplements on the US market are 100% apo-lactoferrin.\n\nIn one Italian clinical trial, 100 milligrams twice a day of 20-30% iron-saturated lactoferrin taken just prior to meals improved anemia in women with various forms of chronic inflammation just as effectively as an iron supplement. This was striking because the lactoferrin contained less than one milligram of iron whereas the iron supplement provided 105 milligrams per day of iron as ferrous sulfate. Despite having so little iron, lactoferrin increased serum iron by 48%. It accomplished this by cutting IL-6 in half, which allowed the iron to escape the grasp of ferritin, thereby allowing it to be mobilized for circulation throughout the body and also for hemoglobin production.\n\nThat trial was not randomized, but a randomized controlled Egyptian trial in adults with chronic kidney disease and anemia and another in children found similarly that the improvement in hemoglobin was the same or better with lactoferrin than iron and that the lactoferrin reduced IL-6 levels.\n\nI have reviewed the literature more broadly in the appendix.1\n\nWhile the 20-30% iron-saturated lactoferrin has not been studied head-to-head against apo-lactoferrin, iron-saturated lactoferrin is more resistant to digestion, has a different profile of antimicrobial activity, is more reflective of what is available from natural foods, and is what has been studied for IL-6 lowering and therefore what we should base our conclusions on.\n\nThe smaller body of literature using apolactoferrin does not show clear reductions in IL-6.\n\nThus, the natural, partially iron-saturated form of lactoferrin is what should be used to try to resolve sticky inflammation.\n\nUntil recently, the only lactoferrin supplement on the market was an Italian product, Lattoglobina.\n\nHowever, two brands have recently started selling such a product in the US:\n\nDouble Wood sells a natural partially iron-saturated lactoferrin that appears to be purified from dairy products using a patented process with high purity.\n\nDouble Wood sells a natural partially iron-saturated lactoferrin that appears to be purified from dairy products using a patented process with high purity.\n\nThe Lactoferrin Co sells 95% pure partially iron-saturated lactoferrin isolated from grass-fed milk, as a powder or as enterically coated capsules.\n\nThe Lactoferrin Co sells 95% pure partially iron-saturated lactoferrin isolated from grass-fed milk, as a powder or as enterically coated capsules.\n\nThe need for enteric coating is unclear and has not been clinically studied. Taking the lactoferrin on an empty stomach can prevent the stomach from becoming acidic enough to degrade it, and the successful anemia trials approximated this by having the lactoferrin taken just prior to the meals. It is likely the Double Wood product is more pure for those sensitive to dairy, but neither product is dairy-free. It is worthwhile to experiment with the three products from the two brands to compare their utility since their differences lie in gray areas.\n\n100 milligrams twice a day cut IL-6 in half, so it might be that 400 milligrams per day in 2-4 divided doses could completely normalize IL-6. While this has not been studied much, it is worth trying 200-400 milligrams of natural iron-saturated lactoferrin per day in 2-4 divided doses, taken before meals or on an empty stomach, to help resolve stubborn inflammation, especially if your IL-6 is high.\n\nWhile milk naturally contains lactoferrin, and while the early milk meant for a newborn known as colostrum is especially enriched in it, a capsule of colostrum only contains about 2.6 milligrams of lactoferrin and raw milk (pasteurization destroys over half of the lactoferrin) probably only has around 10 milligrams per cup. Thus, colostrum is a good source if you are drinking it in volume like a newborn would and raw milk is a good source if it makes up most of your calories, but these are not good sources to obtain 200 to 400 milligrams of lactoferrin per day as a supplement to your existing diet.\n\nOn the other hand, while whey protein manufacturers do not measure and report the lactoferrin contents of their products and there is about two-fold variation between products according to the literature, we can say that one to two 20-gram scoops of whey protein will provide about 200 milligrams of natural partially iron-saturated lactoferrin, and you can use two to four scoops to obtain 400 milligrams.\n\nThe supplements allow you more optionality for your diet since you don’t need to occupy a large portion of your protein requirement and a substantial portion of your caloric load with a protein powder.\n\nI have updated several guides, ebooks, and articles that had only linked to the Italian product to now include the Double Wood and Lactoferrin Co products:\n\nThe Vitamins and Minerals 101 Cliff Notes\n\nThe Vitamins and Minerals 101 Cliff Notes\n\nVitamins and Minerals 101: Iron\n\nVitamins and Minerals 101: Iron\n\nThe Iron Deficiency Protocol\n\nThe Iron Deficiency Protocol\n\nThe Crohn’s Protocol\n\nThe Crohn’s Protocol\n\nThe Science Behind the Crohn’s Protocol\n\nThe Science Behind the Crohn’s Protocol\n\nIs Lactoferrin Chelating Your Iron?\n\nIs Lactoferrin Chelating Your Iron?\n\nThe Iron Deficiency and Crohn’s protocols and the COVID Guide also include dairy-free options for lowering IL-6.\n\nHow robust is the conclusion about natural, partially iron-saturated lactoferrin lowering IL-6 and apolactoferrin failing to do so?\n\nThe first anemia trial mentioned was not randomized or blinded, so it suffers from the potential of various biases, yet it makes physiological sense and paints a coherent picture across mechanisms and outcomes.\n\nA randomized and controlled but not blinded trial in 70 patients with chronic kidney disease, high IL-6, and anemia, showed that the addition of 200 milligrams of lactoferrin per day from the Egyptian product Provan, which is 30% iron-saturated, to the background treatment of agents that stimulate hemoglobin synthesis, lowered IL-6 by 71% from 31 to 9 picograms per milliliter (pg/mL).\n\nIn 92 obese children with IBD and iron deficiency anemia randomized to three months of 6 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight per day iron as ferrous sulfate or 100 milligrams of lactoferrin per day, hemoglobin improved better on lactoferrin than on iron, and lactoferrin decreased IL-6 by 34%. This study used a product called Pravotin, which is 30% iron-saturated.\n\nA study published in Nature Scientific Reports earlier this year was randomized but not blinded and found similar results in children with chronic kidney disease: 33% lower IL-6 and improvement in anemia that was identical to iron supplementation. The dose of lactoferrin was 100 milligrams per day and it was given for three months and compared to 50 milligrams of intravenous iron dextran three times per week. Nothing is stated about the type of lactoferrin used or its sourcing, but this study is also Egyptian, raising to me the possibility it used either the Provan or Pravotin product.\n\nAnother paper out of Egypt described their lactoferrin as “regular,” whatever that means, and in a 3-month randomized but not blinded trial in obese children with iron deficiency anemia the improvement in hemoglobin was superior with 100 milligrams of lactoferrin taken 15 minutes before meals compared to 6 milligrams per kilogram iron as ferrous hydroxide polymaltose. The IL-6 went down 68% from baseline in the lactoferrin group but remained insanely high (55 pg/mL), while it more than doubled in the iron group. IL-6 increasing with iron supplementation is not surprising because IL-6 would help raise ferritin to sequester the excess iron, but the levels reported seem way too high and might result from a calculation error. The study is not listed on pubmed, adding further question about it. If the results are real, I similarly wonder if it used either the Provan or Pravotin product.\n\nIn 21 pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia at risk for preterm delivery, 100 milligrams of lactoferrin taken orally twice a day before meals lowered IL-6 in cervicovaginal fluid by 43%. The authors made the embarrassing mistake of referring to their lactoferrin throughout the entire paper as recombinant human lactoferrin when it was in fact bovine lactoferrin. Another paper found dramatic resolution of high IL-6 in cervicovaginal fluid when administered vaginally to women at low risk of preterm labor for shortened cervix. These papers are from Italy, and my suspicion is they are using partially iron-saturated lactoferrin like the original Italian anemia paper.\n\nAn American study using a genetically engineered rice-derived product in older women showed no impact on IL-6, but their IL-6 was not elevated and it is not clear whether this product was all the apo form or not. However, since American products are usually apo, this was probably apo.\n\nA study using Jarrow apolactoferrin claimed to show it lowered IL-6 in diabetics, but the study claims to have randomized the diabetics to lactoferrin and control, yet only shows IL-6 before and after the lactoferrin compared to the healthy controls, which shows that the product did not do what the authors wanted it to, so they chose the most misleading way to present it in the best light, which suggests that apolactoferrin does not lower IL-6.\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled Spanish study in preterm infants showed that 150 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight per day lactoferrin had no effect on IL-6 over four weeks, but IL-6 declined to normal in both groups during the four weeks, suggesting there was little opportunity for the supplement to cause additional lowering beyond that which occurred in the placebo group. They used the Italian partially iron-saturated lactoferrin used in the Italian anemia paper.\n\nOverall it appears the following are true:\n\nIL-6 levels need to be elevated for anything to reduce them (obviously) so studies where IL-6 is not elevated do not show good results regardless of what product is used.\n\nIL-6 levels need to be elevated for anything to reduce them (obviously) so studies where IL-6 is not elevated do not show good results regardless of what product is used.\n\nThere is a general sense across studies that 200 milligrams per day causes a larger decrease in IL-6 than 100 milligrams per day.\n\nThere is a general sense across studies that 200 milligrams per day causes a larger decrease in IL-6 than 100 milligrams per day.\n\nAll of the successful studies either use a partially iron-saturated product or are conducted in countries like Italy or Egypt where every other study that does report the specific product reports it as partially iron-saturated.\n\nAll of the successful studies either use a partially iron-saturated product or are conducted in countries like Italy or Egypt where every other study that does report the specific product reports it as partially iron-saturated.\n\nTwo studies are not successful, one likely using the apo form and one that definitely used the apo form.\n\nTwo studies are not successful, one likely using the apo form and one that definitely used the apo form.\n\nNo studies compare apolactoferrin and partially iron-saturated lactoferrin head to head, but analysis of the existing literature makes it a reasonably supported hypothesis that partially iron-saturated lactoferrin is superior to apolactoferrin for this purpose. Since this is the natural form and there is a limited mechanistic basis for explaining why it would be superior, everything points towards using a partially iron-saturated product as a first choice with a higher probability of success.\n\nSubtitle: Not all lactoferrin is created equal!\n\nDescription: Not all lactoferrin is created equal!",

    "title": "The Problem With St. John's Wort",
    "content": "Saint John’s Wort has a large body of literature supporting its use for depression, but it is relegated to a position of last resort in the Depression Protocol because it is really an herbal version of an SSRI rather than an alternative.\n\nA meta-analysis of 27 trials including 3,808 patients supports St. John’s Wort as a monotherapy having nearly identical efficacy to SSRIs when used for four to twelve weeks, but with a 41% lower rate of dropping out due to side effects.\n\nA meta-analysis focused on clinical recommendations concluded that “St John’s wort flowers at doses of 600mg to 1800mg (3:1–7:1 extract depending on product) per day standardised to a dose of approximately 0.2–0.3% hypericin and/or 5–6% hyperforin (once to three times per day depending on extract) is recommended for monotherapy in mild to moderate depression.”\n\nHowever, St. John’s Wort makes little sense as a substitute for SSRIs when it essentially is an example of the closely related drug class of SNRIs. Pharmacological investigations suggest that it is a modest inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and a powerful inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. It may also activate the sigma-1 receptor, a powerful mitochondrial effect exhibited to varying degrees by the different SSRIs. By blocking the cellular uptake of serotonin, we would expect it to have all the same effects on mitochondrial function as SSRIs broadly have.\n\nIndeed, this herb might have a similar withdrawal syndrome as SSRIs do. One case was reported where a 58-year-old postmenopausal woman used 1800 milligrams three times a day for 32 days. She started developing photosensitivity, so stopped using it. Within 24 hours, she developed nausea, anorexia, dry retching, dizziness, dry mouth, thirst, cold chills, and extreme fatigue. These problems peaked on day 3, started getting better on day eight, and led to nine pounds of weight loss.\n\nIn a telephone survey of 43 individuals who used St. John’s Wort, thirteen developed withdrawal symptoms when they tried stopping. Nine had to restart it to make them go away, one had them resolve in a week, two in two to three weeks, and one was still suffering from them at the time of the survey.\n\nTwenty of them reported side effects, four reporting photosensitivity, eight gastrointestinal upset, ten sleeping difficulties, two fatigue, seven anxiety and restlessness, and one reported sexual dysfunction. Among five who were using it in conjunction with other serotonin-modulating medications, two developed serotonin syndrome.\n\n39 of them used the herb alongside aged meats and cheeses or over-the-counter cough and cold medications, with two of them acutely developing flushing and pounding headaches from the combination. One blacked out after combining it with alcohol.\n\nSt. John’s Wort traditionally had many uses, and in some areas it was used against the melancholy of winter, probably an early name for seasonal affective disorder.\n\nThe rationale was that it flowered on the summer solstice at the time of the feast of St. John the Baptist. Since winter caused depression from lack of sunlight, this yellow flower captured sunlight from the summer solstice that could be administered during winter.\n\nBrain serotonin levels are primarily determined by exposure to light. This lines up well with serotonin’s primary role being to support mitochondrial function during hypoxia because when we rise from sleep we are instantaneously experiencing “relative hypoxia” until our mitochondrial function can rise to adapt to the higher metabolic demand of wakefulness.\n\nIf St. John’s Wort indeed activates the sigma-1 receptor, it would be expected to increase brain serotonin and thereby act similarly to sunlight.\n\nThe fact that one of its principal adverse effects is photosensitivity also lines up with this: by providing too much biochemical similarity to sunlight, one overdoses on the sunlight.\n\nThese collectively support the traditional concept that the flower captured sunlight as it bloomed on the summer solstice and then delivered it during winter to those who consumed it.\n\nThe photosensitivity of St. John’s Wort can include sun-induced pain, paresthesia, and rashes.\n\nSSRIs can cause various forms of photosensitivity as well, including hyperpigmentation, epilepsy, and skin rashes.\n\nSince photosensitivity is shared across these substances, it probably results from their main mechanisms of action regarding serotonin synthesis and transport.\n\nThis might be due to driving tryptophan into the synthesis of serotonin and away from the synthesis of NAD+. Sunlight exposure causes DNA damage, which requires the irreversible loss of NAD+ to repair, thereby synergizing to aggravate NAD+ deficiency in the tissues most exposed to sunlight, such as the skin and the eyes. This principle underlies the photosensitivity of classical pellagra expressed as the “dermatitis” of the “three D’s” (or four, if you include “death”).\n\nAlternatively, elevated catabolism of serotonin to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) could cause photosensitivity because this compound becomes cytotoxic when exposed to light.\n\nIf we put the St. John’s wort data into historical perspective, it seems that traditional flower concoctions probably had lower doses, and use for the melancholy of winter limited the duration of use to twelve weeks.\n\nThis is in gross contrast to the modern diagnostic framework that identifies people as depressed instead of identifying “melancholy” as something that occurs due to “temporary deficiency of sunlight,” that demanded a temporary fix. The modern treatment framework then puts people on SSRIs for years, which has no basis whatsoever in the randomized controlled trial literature and is tied to horrific imprisonment of people with the threat of severe and protracted withdrawal.\n\nWhile randomized controlled trials should indeed be used as the gold standard for inferring causation between a strategy and its outcome, they should not provide the boundaries of safe use in most cases except to potentially restrict them beyond the traditional use of an herb.\n\nWhile the pharmaceutical-medical industrial complex claims to follow randomized controlled trials to make treatment decisions, this is mostly fake. For example, SSRIs are mostly studied up to twelve weeks but SSRIs are on average prescribed for five years.\n\nIronically, the medieval European use of St. John’s Wort better conformed to the boundaries of modern randomized controlled trials without even knowing about them, since its use lasted for one season rather than being used indefinitely for years.\n\nSince St. John’s Wort has equivalent efficacy and superior tolerability to SSRIs, it is better to use St. John’s Wort than SSRIs.\n\nHowever, since it does work in much the same way and it does pose a similar risk of withdrawal-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, it should be used toward the lower end of the effective dose range and for no longer than twelve weeks. It should be used only if still needed after addressing nutritional deficiencies, idiosyncratic mitochondrial dysfunction, and the low-hanging fruit of depression prevention such as boosting protein intake up to the range that powerfully protects against depression.\n\nThis is exactly how I have positioned it in the Depression Protocol.\n\nSubtitle: Is this herbal medicine an alternative to treating depression with drugs, or just a drug in another form?\n\nDescription: Is this herbal medicine an alternative to treating depression with drugs, or just a drug in another form?",

    "title": "Beat Depression Without SSRIs or Other Drugs",
    "content": "The first-line treatment for depression in modern society is SSRIs, but long-term SSRI use can cause sexual dysfunction, it can cause severe mitochondrial dysfunction in a rare subset of people, and years-long SSRI use leads to severe withdrawal syndromes becoming common and often leads to new-onset mitochondrial function that lasts years.\n\nWhile 80% of psychiatrists would put a depressed person on an SSRI, only 40% of them would put themselves on an SSRI if they were depressed.\n\nEven psychiatrists do not understand how SSRIs work: they think they are mood-boosting drugs that offer some kind of normalization or reset to the neurotransmitter effect of serotonin, but in fact they act through the whole body, have enormous impacts on mitochondrial function, interfere with the necessary benefits of intracellular serotonin and mitochondrial melatonin to mitochondrial energy production, and themselves enter cells where they can have disparate but sometimes powerful impacts on the sigma-1 receptor (beneficial but meant to be activated cyclically, not chronically) and themselves can act as mitochondrial poisons once they reach the mitochondria.\n\nTo make matters far worse, many people are prescribed SSRIs by general practitioners, who lack both an understanding of how SSRIs work and the expertise to do a thorough psychological evaluation of the person.\n\nIt may surprise you that SSRIs do not have a randomized controlled trial basis to justify the way they are used clinically, nor do they even have superior randomized controlled trial results to drug-free approaches!\n\nFor example, there are 52 trials in adults with SSRIs with the average lasting eight weeks, most lasting no longer than twelve weeks, and the longest lasting a year, and zero evidence justifying the average clinical use lasting five years.\n\nWhile SSRIs have 52 trials and about 10,000 total subjects studied, supplements have 192 trials with just under 17,000 total subjects studied.\n\nPsychotherapeutic approaches had 198 trials in adults with over 15,000 total subjects studied over a decade ago and have far more now.\n\nExercise approaches in adults have over 218 trials with just over 14,000 subjects studied.\n\nSo, just three classes of drug-free approaches to depression combined have twelve times as many clinical trials in adults as SSRIs have with almost five times as many total people studied.\n\nWhat may surprise you even more — often a single supplement outperforms an SSRI when it is almost certain that a depressed person actually needs multiple corrections to their nutritional status.\n\nThis is often true in the average person without doing any testing, when individualizing correction of nutritional status would certainly provide superior results.\n\nNevertheless, these trials are not all of equal quality, and interpreting them is best done with biochemical and physiological expertise in how the treatments work to assemble how they can best be synergistically combined in different people.\n\nFurther, even some herbal medicines have impacts very similar to SSRIs and carry some of the same risks. Thus, understanding how the herbal medicines work and comparing their trials to the SSRI trials is necessary for safe implementation of a protocol.\n\nTo help you do this for yourself, or, if you are a health care practitioner, for your patients, I have analyzed the research and produced a 17-page how-to guide, How to Heal From Depression Without SSRIs or Other Drugs.\n\nThis synthesizes the best of a scientific and mechanistic understanding of how depression is caused and how to heal from it with an evidence-based analysis of the hundreds of randomized controlled trials showing human outcomes of improvement in depression.\n\nThis is not a review of the evidence. I will review the evidence in a separate article. This is strictly a step-by-step how-to guide.\n\nIt provides three approaches: a five-page guide to “throwing the kitchen sink” at it for people who need fast results; a three-page guide to “try it and see if it works” for people who want to engage the middle of the road approach between quick results and quality results; and a nine-page guide to “optimize it” for the people who want to invest time and money in a slow-and-steady-wins-the-race approach to secure the highest quality results for the long-term.\n\nFor the science behind this protocol, go here:\n\nThe Science Behind The Depression Protocol\n\nThe Depression Protocol contains the practical how-tos to beat depression without SSRIs or other drugs.\n\nThis is part of a series of protocols.

    "content": "If you are trying to improve your health with strategies that go beyond the basics of What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health, you need a way of knowing whether what you’re doing is working.\n\nWhile producing self-rated health scores from the things you care most about is the best way to not get led astray by proxy markers, tracking glucose, ketones, and lactate can add some more objective math to your tracking and can often act as a leading indicator of a problem to come or can help you interpret the nature of a problem you are currently experiencing.\n\nEnergy Metabolism Governs Everything, and these are the three markers of energy metabolism you can measure at home to reflect the state of your mitochondrial energy production.\n\nThe primary reason to track all three is that\n\nGlucose shows how efficiently your cells use carbs for energy.\n\nGlucose shows how efficiently your cells use carbs for energy.\n\nKetones show you how your body chooses to use fat or carbs for energy.\n\nKetones show you how your body chooses to use fat or carbs for energy.\n\nand lactate reveals whether your mitochondria are overstressed by the demands you are placing on them.\n\nand lactate reveals whether your mitochondria are overstressed by the demands you are placing on them.\n\nThis protocol serves as a general framework for testing and interpreting these three markers. It provides you with details of how to get set up, best practices for testing, how to pick timepoints to test, normal ranges for all three markers, expected responses to eating meals, and then walks you through eight different patterns of change, giving you actionable solutions to each pattern you observe.\n\nThis is part of a series of protocols. See all of the protocols here:\n\nSee All Protocols\n\nDownload the protocol here:\n\nBy Chris Masterjohn, PhD, 2025.\n\nThis protocol provides a general framework for interpreting glucose, ketones, and lactate when used for your own self-experiments, when using my overarching Optimization Framework, or when using any of my Protocols.\n\nFor the rationale behind testing glucose, ketones, and lactate, read the “Glucose, Ketones, and Lactate” section of Three Tests to Transform Your Health.\n\nObtain ​KetoMojo meter and strips​, Novabiomedical Lactate Plus ​meter​, Novabiomedical Lactate Plus ​strips​, and ​alcohol pads​. If you plan to do a LOT of testing, get ​extra KetoMojo strips​, extra ​lactate strips​, and ​extra 30g lancets.\n\nWhen testing, wash your finger with soap, rinse well, then wipe with an alcohol pad, let air dry or lightly blot with a very clean tissue, then puncture your finger. Lightly massage your finger with soft lateral motion if needed but do not squeeze it. Wipe away the first 2-3 drops of blood with a very clean tissue, then test.\n\nThe meters can be finicky at first, especially the lactate meter. Put the edge of the strip at the surface of the drop and let it sip it up rather than shoving the strip into the drop. Make sure your drop of blood is big enough that the blood moves rapidly through the strip without stalling.\n\nIf you have trouble getting enough blood for this, try looking for the least calloused part of your finger. For many people, this is off to the side rather than the tip or the front face. If you cannot get enough blood to generate several large drops to wipe away prior to testing, you can try using a 28g lancet or a 21g lancet. The smaller the gauge the larger the needle, so you are sacrificing comfort and possibly risking more pain in order to get more blood. Ultimately, being able to wipe away two to three sizable drops before testing is necessary for accuracy.\n\nThe most important time of day to test is soon after you wake up, while you are fasting, while you are still in the resting state and before you have gotten the chance to get riled up or do any meaningful activity.\n\nOptionally, you can pick a second time to test if you find a meaningful reason to.\n\nOne reason to do so would be that you have a predictable daily cyclicality to a health problem you are trying to solve. For example, you always experience sleepiness a half hour after lunch or you always experience anxiety around sunset, or you always wake up at 3AM without being able to go back to sleep. If anything like this is true, measure at the point the problem is most activated, or at the time of day you expect the problem to be most activated.\n\nAnother reason to do so would be that your values are most abnormal at a certain time of day. The only way to know this is to test many time points during the day to sample what could be abnormal. Then, if you see a consistent pattern of abnormality at a repeating timepoint, use that as your second time point to test.\n\nIf you do an exploratory period of multiple tests throughout the day, reasonable time points to test apart from waking fasting would be just before each meal, one and two hours after each meal, and just before bed.\n\nThe best postprandial timepoint to use is one hour after you finish a meal. This is the most common time point reported in the literature postprandially, so it is easier to define what is “normal” compared to other time points.\n\nYou shouldn’t test during and after exercise unless you use external guidance about how to interpret exercise zones and lactate clearance in response to training regimens. To judge your general health, focus on the simpler interpretations of resting data here.\n\nIf you do a lot of testing, you will be doing repeated microdamage to your fingers. Try to rotate them as much as possible. If you can use each finger on a rotating basis, you can test daily but each finger will have ten days to recover between punctures.\n\nSince your finger prick will elicit a mix of capillary and venous blood alongside extracellular fluid and the contents of damaged cells, and since even the pure blood would be whole blood rather than plasma, you are going to get differences from a draw of venous plasma in the lab, and you are going to get more variability. You can limit this variability by following the guidelines above to remove two to three sizeable drops of blood before testing. You could also experiment with pricking your ear lobe instead of your finger.\n\nHowever, if you are testing daily for weeks on each protocol regimen, as strongly advised in the Optimization Framework, the variability will average out over time, and by focusing on the averages you can avoid getting lost in the weeds.\n\nOne thing you should not do is second-guess abnormal data and retest it because you don’t trust it. Do any kind of validation experiments you want to assess the variability, but do them separately from your actual data collection. In order to minimize bias, you have to accept the data you generate without second-guessing and selectively repeating it.\n\nClick here to download the Ultimate Optimization Spreadsheet.\n\nDo not open it in Excel or any other desktop program. Immediately drag and drop it into Google Drive and double click to open it as a Google Sheet.\n\nOtherwise, features will be lost.\n\nIf you are only testing waking, resting, fasted numbers, use the columns that are prelabeled as glucose, ketones, and lactate.\n\nIf you are measuring a second or third timepoint in the day, make a separate column for it. You can either rename the extracted variables and one of the self-rated variables as “afternoon glucose” and so on, or you can add additional variables as outlined at 18:43 in this video.\n\nYou do not want to mix and match different time points in the same column, because doing so will make it extremely messy to document protocol averages and rolling averages.\n\nCited values are in mg/dL for glucose and mmol/L for ketones and lactate. Online calculators allow you to interconvert these for glucose, ketones, and lactate.\n\nWaking glucose should be under 90 and close to 80 mg/dL, with lower values being fine as long as you do not feel hangry, anxious, faint, or lose any neuromuscular function, energy, or cognitive capacity. Below 70 mg/dL can be suspected of being a problem, but often if your ketones rise to feed your brain adequately you can easily tolerate values lower than this.\n\nWaking lactate should be 0.5-0.9 mmol/L.\n\nPostprandial glucose should be under 140 at any time point and ideally close to 100 after one hour.\n\nPostprandial lactate should be under 1.5 and ideally 0.9-1.2.\n\nKetones should be 0-0.2 mmol/L around the clock unless you are on a ketogenic diet or using MCT oil or large amounts of coconut. If you are on a ketogenic diet, you are probably not going to push much higher than 1.5 mmol/L, but if your diet is shifted sufficiently in favor of fat at the expense of both protein and carbohydrate, especially if you are also hypocaloric or if you are including MCT oil, it is possible for ketones to be pushed to 3-5 mmol/L and this is not necessarily abnormal. Ketones above 0.2 mmol/L on a non-ketogenic diet should be suspected as abnormal and ketones above 5 mmol/L on a strongly ketogenic diet should be suspected as a potential acidosis risk.\n\nIn response to a meal, especially in response to a carbohydrate-inclusive meal, glucose should go up, lactate should go up, and ketones should go down.\n\nIf you are using one of my Protocols, the primary interpretation of how these numbers change is that if they move closer to the optimal range, what you are doing is working, and if they move further away from the optimal range, what you are doing is not working, or you have gone beyond your tolerance for a certain step. Consistent with the Optimization Framework, you are primarily relying on protocol step averages after you see in the visual charts that the rolling time-based averages have stabilized.\n\nHowever, there are some notable change patterns that can help you further interpret these numbers even if you are using them without an existing protocol for exploratory purposes:\n\nIf glucose goes up and lactate goes down, this likely represents an impairment in glycolysis. You may be taking a medication that blocks glycolysis, such as aspirin, or you may have a dietary or metabolic toxin that blocks glycolysis, such as oxalate, or you may be deficient in a nutrient needed for glycolysis, such as niacin (vitamin B3) or potassium.\n\nTo manage oxalate, use my Oxalate Protocol.\n\nThe best way to increase niacin is to add one to three tablespoons of Sari Nutritional Yeast to anything that could use a cheesy flavor or to replace part of your regular meat with an organ blend such as US Wellness 75% Ground Beef With Heart, Kidney, and Liver. You can also add Niagen. If you do, you may use 300 milligrams a day for three to four days as a loading dose but then should start at a maintenance dose of ⅛ or ¼ of a capsule per day and titrate up slowly over time until the markers optimize. Any form of niacin should always be spread out as evenly across meals as is practical, and if you experience any adverse effects from it at doses that are helping to optimize your markers you can try matching it with an equal amount of trimethylglycine (TMG).\n\nThe best way to increase potassium is to increase the amount of potassium-rich foods in your diet, which include the lean portions of animal foods with juices consumed, lean portions of milk, egg whites (consume with yolks), tubers, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Replacing refined grains with whole grains can help, but replacing grains altogether with foods from the list above helps much more. Replacing fat with those foods will help as well. Track your diet in Cronometer and get your food potassium up to at least 4.7 grams (4,700 milligrams) per day. If you use a supplement, review with your doctor that neither your medical conditions nor medications interfere with potassium excretion (explained in more detail in the Cheat Sheet); make sure you evenly distribute the supplement across meals, preferably taking it after a meal, or spreading it across the beginning and end of the meal; you can use citrate or gluconate, but if you supplement with grams per day you should start taking both citrate and gluconate and possibly other forms such as bicarbonate to avoid overdoing any one organic acid.\n\nIf glucose goes down and lactate goes up, this likely represents an improvement in glycolysis. If the lactate stays within the optimal range, the rise in lactate can be tolerated. Ideally, it self-resolves over a few days or a week with the lactate coming back down to where it was. If the lactate gets pushed out of the normal range or gets worse over time, this indicates that your respiratory chain is not keeping up with the improvement in glycolysis.\n\nIf the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme is limiting, the most likely solution is to improve your thiamin status. The best way to improve your thiamin status is to add one to three tablespoons of Sari Nutritional Yeast to anything that could use a cheesy flavor. If you need more, you can start with one to three droppers full of liquid thiamin if you digestively tolerate the glycerin, and then, if you still need more, move on to between a half capsule, slowly titrated up to as many as five capsules per day of TTFD. While using thiamin, watch carefully for a further increase in lactate and pull back to the dose that does not raise your lactate. If you cannot find a dose of thiamin that reverses the rise in lactate, you are most likely dealing with a respiratory chain impairment to be dealt with as described next.\n\nIf your respiratory chain is limited, this could be any one of 297 different genetic problems with a role for almost any of the essential nutrients. If you cannot resolve the rise in lactate out of the normal range by using the methods contained within the protocol you are using, Track Your Diet in Cronometer and make sure you are meeting all of my custom Nutrient Targets. If that does not work, run the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening and interpret it with the Cheat Sheet. If that does not work, run Mitome. If you are not resource-limited, you can run all of these at once and retest them as often as needed to arrive at the final resolution of the rise in lactate.\n\nIf lactate goes up without a change in glucose, by contrast, this indicates that you are stressing your pyruvate dehydrogenase or your or your respiratory chain with whatever you are doing. If you don’t have a solid empirical benefit to your health arising from your strategy, simply reverse it. If you do have an empirical benefit, try moderating the dose to one that does not raise lactate. If you cannot do so, you should explore alternative strategies to give you the same benefit without the rise in lactate, or revert to the ways to optimize your pyruvate dehydrogenase or respiratory chain in the two paragraphs directly preceding this one.\n\nIf glucose goes up without a change in lactate or ketones, this might indicate a blended effect of impaired glycolysis and respiratory chain function and you should moderate your strategy or reverse course as just described.\n\nIf glucose goes up and ketones go down this suggests that your carbohydrate supply is increasing, either because you are eating or absorbing more net carbs or because something is favoring greater glycogen breakdown. You should see if this self-resolves over several weeks, in which case you simply had to adjust to the greater glucose supply. However, if it does not show stable and linear improvement you should treat it as a case of overwhelmed glycolysis and should try the oxalate, niacin, and potassium strategies listed above. Otherwise you should engage in moderation or reversal of your strategy.\n\nKetones being abnormally high with normal glucose and lactate could be due to impaired utilization of ketones, in which case you should focus on suppressing fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis with carbs and protein.\n\nAbnormally high ketones could also be due to poor pyruvate carboxylase activity or poor respiratory chain function. This would be especially likely if you can demonstrate that eating carbs increases your ketones instead of decreasing them. This is called paradoxical postprandial ketogenesis. If you don’t have a severe problem, you may only be able to observe this after provoking it with an 18-hour fast and showing that ketones go up at the 15-minute mark. This would need to be shown after several repetitions compared to several observations of a control period (15 additional minutes of fasting) conducted in randomized order.\n\nPyruvate carboxylase activity can be improved with biotin or manganese, or by reducing oxalate levels.\n\nTo manage oxalate, use my Oxalate Protocol.\n\nManganese can be supplemented in 3-8 milligrams per day, but no one should supplement with manganese without first running the screening for manganese overload contained within my Manganese Detox Protocol.\n\nBiotin can best be obtained as follows. First, make the base of your diet rich in grass-fed animal products, a diversity of fermented foods, and a large volume of fresh produce. Then, add one egg yolk equivalent for every 25 grams of non-collagen protein in your diet. Each egg yolk equivalent can be any of the following: one raw or cooked egg yolk with the white thrown in the trash; one whole egg boiled for at least four minutes; 1.5 fried eggs; 3.5 poached eggs; 8 grams of natto; 9 grams of chicken liver; or 36 grams of beef liver. If you need a supplement to obtain more, you can obtain low doses from Solgar 300 microgram tablets or from Life Extension 600 micrograms, which is a capsule that can be easily emptied into smaller doses. Higher doses can be obtained from Jarrow 5 milligrams, which is a cost-effective option, or Pure Encapsulations 8 milligrams, which is a brand that seems anecdotally to have the least likelihood of adverse response to low-level contaminants. Biotin should be slowly titrated up from the lowest dose you can find that lowers ketones without raising glucose or lactate, stabilizing at each dose before moving on, and increasing the dose until you hit the point of diminishing returns and then slightly pulling back.\n\nIf none of this works, you should assume the problem is in the respiratory chain, in which case you should use Cronometer, the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening, and Mitome as described in the second paragraph of the previous page.\n\nIf glucose and ketones go up together without a rise in lactate, this suggests either that your fatty acid oxidation is displacing your glucose utilization or that oxalate is accumulating and inhibiting glycolysis and simultaneously inhibiting the citric acid cycle. To address excess fatty acid oxidation try lowering your consumption of fat or your intake of riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and CoQ10. To manage oxalate, use my Oxalate Protocol.\n\nIf glucose, ketones, and lactate all rise together, you may have a blended problem of two or more of any of the above, but almost certainly are overburdening your respiratory chain. This strongly suggests you should reverse course, unless you are getting an empirical benefit, in which case you should fix your respiratory chain using Cronometer, the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening, and Mitome as described in the second paragraph of the previous page.\n\nSubtitle: A comprehensive quick-guide to interpretation of these three critical markers.\n\nDescription: A comprehensive quick-guide to interpretation of these three critical markers.",

    "content": "If you are already doing What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health and there are still things you want to improve about your current health or that you want to optimize to protect your future health and longevity, it may be time to do some lab testing beyond whatever your doctor orders for you in your checkups.\n\nThe problem with this is that there are all kinds of things you could test, and most of the things that actually move the needle beyond the standard of care that the average person gets from mainstream medicine aren’t covered by insurance.\n\nAnother problem is that so many labs can be poorly interpreted that it is easy to get misled into making the wrong health decisions.\n\nSo how do you juggle decisions of when to test things when you need to balance your budget?\n\nHow do you make sure your testing reflects the root cause of your issues and what can be done about them, instead of just telling you whether you have a problem?\n\nAnd how do you ensure everything gets interpreted properly?\n\nHere we cover the three most important things to test to get game-changing health results.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThe right time to start testing is when you are already doing what you know to be best, and you are still hitting a point where you need further improvement, yet you are at a loss about which decision to make next.\n\nThus, focus first on What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health.\n\nIn my Optimization Framework, the next thing to do is assess your progress. If you have a specific problem, address the known low-hanging fruit. That is, try some things that are well known to work for large numbers of other people to see if they also work well for you. If you still need improvement after that, or if you simply want to optimize, you then enter a rigorous optimization cycle that includes comprehensive measurement of everything relevant.\n\nIf your goal has highly specific signs of success, and if you have the patience, then you should follow through with any low-hanging fruit, then should start testing once you reach the limits of that approach.\n\nHowever, if you want faster answers, you can speed ahead to testing once you have made sure you’re mastering the basics.\n\nMaking sure you are getting enough of each vitamin and mineral should be the foundation of any testing you do, because everything in your body is either something you ate or something you made from what you ate.\n\nMacronutrients (protein, fat, and carbs) are just as important as micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), but assessing whether you are getting enough protein is fairly straightforward and your body can very flexibly deal with different ratios of fats and carbs and there are no well-validated tests to tell you if you are currently eating too much of one or the other.\n\nBy contrast, each vitamin and mineral has a requirement that can be characterized as an population average and some variation around the average where 95% of people will have a requirement within two standard deviations of it. Since 5% of people will be outliers with very different requirements and most people differ from the average, testing the assortment of very well validated markers of nutrient status is the best way to determine whether you are personally meeting your requirement.\n\nThe probability you are missing something is high.\n\nWhen scientists ask people in the United States what they eat, a whopping 93% fail to consume enough of at least one vitamin or mineral [1].\n\nIt looks even worse when we break it down by specific nutrients:[2]\n\nOver 90% of people don’t get enough choline, a nutrient that protects against fatty liver disease and supports learning, memory, and relaxation.\n\nOver 90% of people don’t get enough choline, a nutrient that protects against fatty liver disease and supports learning, memory, and relaxation.\n\nOver 60% don’t get enough of vitamins K, E, or D, needed for healthy bones and to protect our tissues from wear and tear as we age.\n\nOver 60% don’t get enough of vitamins K, E, or D, needed for healthy bones and to protect our tissues from wear and tear as we age.\n\nOver 40% don’t get enough magnesium, needed to fuel every process in the body.\n\nOver 40% don’t get enough magnesium, needed to fuel every process in the body.\n\nOver 30% don’t get enough calcium, needed for healthy bones; enough vitamin A, needed for healthy eyes, skin, and sleep; or enough vitamin C, needed to protect against heart disease and cancer.\n\nOver 30% don’t get enough calcium, needed for healthy bones; enough vitamin A, needed for healthy eyes, skin, and sleep; or enough vitamin C, needed to protect against heart disease and cancer.\n\nThe best approach to nutritional testing is to use my Comprehensive Nutritional Screening. You then combine this with Testing Nutritional Status: The Ultimate Cheat Sheet for interpretation. If the labs in the comprehensive screening are not available to you, you use the Appendix on page 81 of the Cheat Sheet, which lists the markers you would need to assemble a comprehensive screening from scratch based on the labs that are available to you.\n\nThe core of this testing is as follows:\n\nSerum or plasma concentrations tell you whether a nutrient is present in the diet and being effectively absorbed.\n\nSerum or plasma concentrations tell you whether a nutrient is present in the diet and being effectively absorbed.\n\nIntracellular concentrations tell you whether a nutrient is getting into your cells effectively.\n\nIntracellular concentrations tell you whether a nutrient is getting into your cells effectively.\n\nFunctional markers tell you whether the nutrient is doing its job.\n\nFunctional markers tell you whether the nutrient is doing its job.\n\nIf you measure functional markers without concentrations, you don’t know if the job isn’t done because there’s no vitamin, because it didn’t make it into the cell, or because there’s another problem. Or, if you have the concentrations but not the functional marker you may verify that there is enough nutrient present but completely miss that there is some other problem such as a genetic impairment that is raising your need for the nutrient. By contrast, if you have all three, you can integrate the information to make a robust conclusion about whether a nutrient’s job is getting done, and, if not, why not and what to do about it.\n\nI use a NovaBiomedical Lactate Plus for finger-prick lactate, KetoMojo for finger-prick glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (ketones) measured at home.\n\nElevated glucose is considered the hallmark of diabetes, which afflicts over a half billion people worldwide.\n\nThis is actually somewhat misleading, because diabetics don’t just have high glucose. They have high ketones, high lactate, high free fatty acids, and high triglycerides too.\n\nDiabetes itself is very unlikely to be a single disease, and is instead a generic hodge podge of hundreds of unique problems in energy metabolism that all converge on a fundamental impairment in effectively turning food energy into cellular energy.\n\nIf you find out at an annual checkup that your glucose is high, this tells you that you may be on the path toward this condition, but it doesn’t tell you anything about why or how to change course.\n\nWhile there are many types of low-hanging fruit that can help, such as optimizing your body composition and exercise program, being able to test your energy metabolites at home allows you to test what they respond to, which then tells you what you can do.\n\nOnce you move the measurement from your doctor’s office to your home, you now empower yourself to take charge.\n\nYou can run experiments on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis to figure out exactly what is working, discarding the things that don’t work and leaning hard into the things that do.\n\nWhile continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are currently trending, until there is a continuous glucose-ketone-lactate meter on the market I advocate using finger prick measurement of glucose, ketones, and lactate simultaneously.\n\nThe reason is that ketones and lactate add context to the glucose measurement to help its interpretation. I would rather have fewer measurements with more context and better interpretation than more measurements with less context that are harder to interpret.\n\nCGMs also run the risk of putting way too much focus on postprandial excursions outside the timeframes that are well validated as meaningful and can also facilitate people running away from glucose spikes without giving their bodies time to adapt to varying carb loads, which are very well established to require weeks of adaptation.\n\nFor interpreting glucose, ketones, and lactate, use my protocol dedicated to that purpose here:\n\nThe #1 At-Home Test to Unlock Your Health (Glucose + Ketones + Lactate)\n\nIf you are trying to improve your health with strategies that go beyond the basics of What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health, you need a way of knowing whether what you’re doing is working.\n\nAs I wrote in Energy Metabolism Governs Everything, every single health issue is profoundly influenced by the ability to produce cellular energy in the form of ATP.\n\nThe respiratory chain of the mitochondria is where you use oxygen from the air you breathe to produce 90% of this ATP.\n\nYou can think of the mitochondrial respiratory chain as the cell’s power plant. In turn, creatine forms the mitochondria’s energy grid, carrying the energy produced in the mitochondria throughout the cell, and glycolysis forms a local power generator.\n\nTesting the respiratory chain can tell you why your glucose, ketones, or lactate are abnormal.\n\nThose may even be normal, but you might not be making enough ATP to invest in things like utilizing your cholesterol instead of leaving it to run high in your blood; making your gut motile enough and your nutrient absorption efficient enough to have well formed stool instead of constipation or diarrhea; or anabolic tissue synthesis to support healthy skin, bones, teeth, and gums.\n\nIt can also explain why you might not be oxidizing NADH, an important energy carrier, which could have many knock-on effects like hurting your activation of vitamin A and thereby making you more vulnerable to getting sick frequently, developing autoimmune disease, and getting cancer.\n\nI developed Mitome to take respiratory chain testing out of the niche field of rare disease diagnosis and reframe it to look for unique idiosyncratic bottlenecks in each person’s respiratory chain. Instead of classifying you as “normal” or “out of range” Mitome is looking for patterns that provide unique insights of how you can best optimize your cellular energy metabolism.\n\nMost importantly, I designed all of the protocols to help you know which nutritional testing you could benefit most from and how you can use glucose, ketones, and lactate to fine-tune the protocol to your own needs.\n\nMany people have asked what the difference is between Mitome and tests such as the Genova ION + 40 or the Mosaic (formerly Great Plains) Organic Acid Test. The ION and OAT contain many markers of the catabolic breakdown of macronutrients that happens inside the mitochondria, but they do not contain any markers of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. When you break down fat, carbohydrate, or protein in these systems, you then deliver the breakdown products to the respiratory chain. If you have a problem in the respiratory chain and in the breakdown of macronutrients, the last thing you want to do is fix the breakdown of macronutrients first, because then you will greatly increase the work you are sending to the impaired respiratory chain.\n\nIt’s as if you had traffic jam at point A and point B when everyone is traveling from A to B. The last thing you want to do is resolve the traffic jam at point A while doing nothing to fix it at point B, as you will double or triple the problem at point B and probably 10x or more the accidents and road rage.\n\nYou always want to fix a downstream problem before an upstream problem, so that when the upstream point starts flowing freely to the downstream point, the downstream point can handle it.\n\nMitome tests the most downstream point there is in your mitochondrial energy production, so it represents the point you want to optimize first.\n\nMany other tests that conventional or functional medicine focuses on are worth testing, but should be seen as effects rather than causes.\n\nFor example, you might want to optimize your cholesterol to optimize your heart disease risk. Before we get into deciding whether we should look at total cholesterol, the total-to-HDL-C ratio, the HDL-C-to-triglyceride ratio, or ApoB, we should first acknowledge the elephant in the room: cholesterol levels are powerfully controlled by thyroid hormone and are mechanistically controlled by the activity of the LDL receptor. In fact, statins work by making your liver cells deficient in cholesterol, which makes them increase the LDL receptor without the need for thyroid hormone to do so.\n\nAs I covered in Hormones Are Never In Charge, thyroid hormone is produced in response to hypothalamic ATP content. The LDL receptor itself requires ATP to fuel the motor protein dynamin, which constitutes the molecular motor that moves the LDL receptor into the cell.\n\nThyroid hormone is influenced by a wide variety of vitamins and minerals. In fact, I have never seen a woman on thyroid hormone who didn’t have low serum iodine, and I find it disturbing that practitioners are prescribing thyroid hormone without measuring iodine status first.\n\nATP production, too, requires most of the nutrients.\n\nBoth thyroid and the LDL receptor together are fundamentally powered by ATP production in the mitochondria. For thyroid hormone, ATP production in the hypothalamus is the driver, and for the LDL receptor, ATP production in the liver is the driver.\n\nAs such it makes no sense to go on statins — which themselves are mitochondrial toxins — before optimizing the nutrients you need for thyroid hormone and ATP production and the identification of the idiosyncratic needs of your respiratory chain.\n\nIn order to put these into their proper context, you want to run two “bonus tests” at home:\n\nBonus 1: Self-Rated Health Scores. “What gets measured gets managed.” Don’t get lost in proxy markers. Rate yourself on the health metrics that matter most to you on a scale of 1-5. Make sure your health strategies are improving these and not just the lab numbers. This is the ultimate determinant that you are getting the health results you want.\n\nBonus 2: Track Your Diet in Cronometer. If you are doing nutritional testing, you will make much better inferences if you characterize the nutrients you are eating. This rounds out the functional markers and concentrations in serum/plasma and cells by showing you whether the nutrients are even in your diet in the first place. Use my Cronometer Guide to get this set up correctly.\n\nIntegrating both are covered in my Optimization Framework.\n\nIf you have unlimited time and money, you should run all of this as a baseline and after each major turning point in the evolution of your health strategy. More data is always better so long as you have trained yourself not to get lost in the weeds or have anxious reactions to data overload.\n\nMost of us need to negotiate the tradeoff, however, and most of us are more limited in one area than the other.\n\nOne important point, though, is “I have no time” or “I have no money” often means “this is not important enough to me to spend my time or money on it.” My own experience is that the greatest waste of time and money I’ve ever made has been in putting off testing of this nature. Time spent in less than optimal health means problems compound themselves over time. Better to invest and accumulate compound dividends than to let problems drag on and accumulate compounding debt payments.\n\nWith that said, tracking your diet is the most time-intensive step and is the part you can forego if you are trying to save time. I would highly recommend you at least do a rough outline of your diet. For example, go into Cronometer, and in a single day, estimate what you eat in a month. Generate the nutrition report for the month, and you’ll now have a daily average of your nutrient intake for the month. Whenever you change your diet, copy that day to a day in the new month, and edit it a little bit to make it more representative of the new diet. That saves a lot of time over meticulously tracking each morsel of food every day, but it still provides you a general sketch of where your nutrients stand.\n\nIf you genuinely have no money to put toward this, you are best to focus on home experiments with affordable foods. For example, how does your self-rated energy respond to increasing the amount of liver or nutritional yeast in your diet or to consuming diets run more on carbohydrate or more on fat?\n\nIf you are trying to hit a middle ground on what you spend, I would run my Mitome test and combine it with testing glucose, ketones, and lactate (GKL) for three days in a row at baseline and at the turn of each of your health strategies.\n\nThere are two reasons to test Mitome first:\n\nSince any problem you fix in your energy metabolism eventually dumps on the respiratory chain, the respiratory chain is what you should fix first to enable anything else to be fixed safely.\n\nSince any problem you fix in your energy metabolism eventually dumps on the respiratory chain, the respiratory chain is what you should fix first to enable anything else to be fixed safely.\n\nI made the protocols with cost-saving people in mind. Rather than telling you that you have to optimize your nutrients first or telling you that you have to do testing afterward, the protocol guides you through how to implement each step while judging its effects with your home testing and rating alone and also tells you when you would be best off running additional nutritional testing alongside that approach. When the protocol recommends testing, it gives you the interpretive framework you need for the recommended tests.\n\nI made the protocols with cost-saving people in mind. Rather than telling you that you have to optimize your nutrients first or telling you that you have to do testing afterward, the protocol guides you through how to implement each step while judging its effects with your home testing and rating alone and also tells you when you would be best off running additional nutritional testing alongside that approach. When the protocol recommends testing, it gives you the interpretive framework you need for the recommended tests.\n\nRunning the comprehensive testing costs about $2400, so the ability of Mitome to select out the nutritional tests that are most necessary can save money as part of the return on the initial investment into the Mitome test.\n\nThe reason to include the GKL is that it adds the highly repeatable pre- and post- home testing to evaluate how your strategies are impacting your energy metabolism. This is critical to tailoring your individualized program.\n\nYou get faster insights when you test everything together at every step of your strategy, but if you have more time than money you can invest more time in self-experiments on self-rated endpoints, and if you have more money than time you can focus more on the comprehensive screening + Mitome, with the middle ground being Mitome + GKL.\n\nThe light way to use these is to do intermittent testing to evaluate the things you do using a “try it and see if it works” approach.\n\nIf your problem or goal is worth the time, or if you are simply obsessed with optimization, you take one of these approaches and then run with it using my Optimization Framework.\n\nDescription: If you are already doing What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health and there are still things you want to improve about your current health or that you want to optimize to protect your future health and longevity, it may be time to do some lab testing beyond whatever your doctor orders for you in your checkups.",

    "content": "Not everyone has to optimize.\n\nIf you are in an emergency, you might need to throw the kitchen sink at the problem until you have some relief, and you may be necessarily in the care of someone else.\n\nIf you are suffering from a debilitating problem, you may feel the need to throw the kitchen sink at it and may not have the mental bandwidth to optimize.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, when you’re getting the best results you could ever dream of, the rule that applies is “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.”\n\nWhen you aren’t in the midst of an emergency and still want to improve something about your health, the first thing you should do is see if you can truly check off all the boxes in What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health. If fixing some low-hanging fruit you are missing gets you what you want, you can now revert back to “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.”\n\nPerhaps you are skeptical that one or two of those boxes is necessary. You can actually test whether checking them off helps you with the strategy described in this optimization guide.\n\nOne reason to optimize would be that you are a data junky and love optimizing everything. Or, you’re a mad scientist and love running experiments on yourself. If that’s you, dive into this strategy with with your whole heart. You’re going to have lots of fun.\n\nFor most people, the reason to optimize is that you are doing what you know to be best practice, but there are still areas where you want to improve.\n\nMaybe your sleep could be better. Or your energy levels. Or you want to gain ten pounds of muscle. Or you’re grappling with a biomarker you are trying to optimize for longevity.\n\nWhatever it is, this is the guide to optimizing anything. We focus on health, but the basic principles apply to everything that could be optimized.\n\nThe key to optimizing optimally is to apply the scientific method to yourself, while artfully balancing rigor and practicality.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to Optimizing Anything is a streamlined 8-page quick guide. Click here to download it.\n\nThis full article is 33 pages long. You can print it out here to read it in natural lighting:\n\nThis guide provides an overarching framework to apply to anything you want to optimize.\n\nIf you want to start reading about what you should optimize, start with my guide to the top three tests to run for your health:\n\n3 Tests to Transform Your Health (and Your Lifespan)\n\nIf you are already doing What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health and there are still things you want to improve about your current health or that you want to optimize to protect your future health and longevity, it may be time to do some lab testing beyond whatever your doctor orders for you in your checkups.\n\nOtherwise, read on about optimization!\n\nYou can use this decision-tree chart to help you figure out if optimization is the right strategy for you at this time.\n\n“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” “throw the kitchen sink at it,” and “try it and see if it works” are all important strategies to use outside of optimization.\n\nIf you are happy with your results on your current regimen, there is no reason to alter it.\n\nIf not, you might need to throw the kitchen sink at the problem or simply try something and see if it works. Throwing the kitchen sink at something makes a mess that is impossible to decipher on the back end, so it only makes sense in an emergency or a completely debilitating situation, and both of those things call for expert guidance or expert care. Low-hanging fruit could either be of the general kind, as outlined in What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health, or of the problem-specific kind.\n\nThere are many problems and there is no end to the number of problem-specific things you could simply try and see if they work, but an example would be that if you are unhappy with the amount of muscle in your chest and you don’t do many pushing exercises, adding some pushups or bench press sets might help you out a lot. Whether something is truly “low-hanging fruit” can often be judged in retrospect on the basis of whether “try something and see if it works” actually worked. If it is well known, though, that almost everyone else who tries a particular strategy gets success with it even if they don’t perform rigorous data tracking, that is a very good sign that “try it and see if it works” could work for you.\n\nIf you’ve gotten to this point and still want better results, now is the time to enter the optimization cycle.\n\nDefine clearly what you are going to optimize.\n\nThis is the dependent variable in the scientific experiment you are performing on yourself.\n\nAs once said by the late, great founder of modern management theory Peter Drucker, “what gets measured gets managed.”\n\nDon’t get lost in proxy markers. If you are trying to optimize feeling rested when you wake up, you must rate yourself on how rested you feel when you wake up. You cannot substitute hours slept because it is easier to measure. If you are trying to increase your libido, you cannot measure your testosterone as a substitute. Be very clear about what you are optimizing, and measure it directly.\n\nThis doesn’t mean you don’t track total hours slept or testosterone. Those are quite possibly causes of how rested you feel when you wake up or how strong your libido is. The point is simply to always measure the thing you care most about.\n\nIf what you are optimizing is already in numeric form — for example, number of hours slept or fasting glucose — you don’t need to convert it in any way.\n\nIf what you are optimizing is not yet in numeric form, you need to convert it into a number. For example, each morning rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 5 on how rested you feel.\n\nYou should use a scale of 1 to 5 instead of 1 to 10 because you want to have clear definitions of each score, and it is a lot harder to come up with 10 clear definitions than 5.\n\nYou can self-rate up to five things. More becomes too cumbersome.\n\nYou can focus on optimizing one or two of them at a time.\n\nThe other three or four can be leading candidates to be optimized in the future, and if you can see wanting to optimize them in the next six months, you should start rating them now. Or, if you’ve already optimized them, you should track them to make sure they stay optimized.\n\nIf you have other things being tracked automatically and effortlessly, you can have as many as you want. For example, if you have a sleep tracking device recording your REM, deep sleep, and resting heart rate, and HRV, and it all gets tracked in an app, it doesn’t take any mental bandwidth for you to track it and there’s no need to translate it into your spreadsheet unless it is a current, past, or leading candidate for a future optimization target.\n\nPre-specify the definitions of your numerical self-ratings now. Spend twenty minutes thinking it out clearly. Define what a 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mean. Glance at this every time you rate yourself until you have it thoroughly memorized and check back with it once a week after that to make sure your “memorized” version doesn’t drift. This holds you to a consistent rating pattern and prevents your perception from drifting along with your expectations over time. It also makes it so that you never have to think too hard about how to rate yourself ever again. Just look at the definitions. If you’re not sure whether you’re a 3 or 4 today, you’re a 3.5. Done. Not having to think too hard or too long about it makes it a sustainable practice.\n\nYou can borrow someone else’s definitions from a questionnaire. But should you? Generally, no. Do this if you feel at a total loss about how to rate yourself, but your definitions are best tailored to what is relevant to your own health goals. Some institutions’s definition of fatigue will never be as relevant to you as your own definition of fatigue, because you are the only person who is intimately familiar with how your own fatigue manifests and feels.\n\nMake your definitions so that you expect to have a monthly average of 3 when you first start tracking. Make them so you expect to see at least a few 2s and at least a few 4s over the course any given month, but you would have to get substantially worse to see a 1 or substantially better to see a 5. You can also set it so that 5 is horrible and 1 is great, whatever is more intuitive to you.\n\nRate yourself every day. Either at the beginning or the end of the day. Make a ritual out of it. It should take one or two minutes.\n\nWhy should you bother with these numerical self-ratings? Five reasons:\n\nIt massively increases precision. Sometimes things change very slowly over time. If your average daily energy level each week is going from 3 to 3.1 to 3.2, it’s probably noisy enough that you can’t even tell the difference. But when you look at your average weekly data you will indeed be able to see it.\n\nIt massively increases precision. Sometimes things change very slowly over time. If your average daily energy level each week is going from 3 to 3.1 to 3.2, it’s probably noisy enough that you can’t even tell the difference. But when you look at your average weekly data you will indeed be able to see it.\n\nIt prevents expectation drift. If you get healthier over time, you will expect to be healthier and you will fail to be impressed by your health. If you get less healthy, the reverse will happen. When your criteria are pre-specified and easy to look at, you will keep your ratings consistent and allow you to make objective comparisons.\n\nIt prevents expectation drift.

When your criteria are pre-specified and easy to look at, you will keep your ratings consistent and allow you to make objective comparisons.\n\nIt allows you to run averages. If you can’t calculate a weekly or monthly average, you are left with a vague sense that “I seem to get startled too often but it’s always going up and down.” But if you’re able to calculate that the weekly average went down from 4.0 to 3.7, you know you’re on to something that seems to be reducing your startle reflex.\n\nIt allows you to run averages.

Simply creating a line chart can allow you to see an upward or downward drift in what you’re measuring very easily where you’d probably miss it going on your general sense alone. Or if you test something in each of several conditions, you can make a bar chart that allows you to quickly get a sense of whether your variable is having an effect.\n\nIt allows you to visualize your data.

You can do this with numbers, but you can’t do this with anything else.\n\nMake Your Measurements Every Day\n\nWhatever you are rating should be rated every single day.\n\nAnything you can measure at home must be measured every single day.\n\nI have seen some people advise their clients to weigh themselves weekly so they don’t get confused and discouraged by random daily fluctuations in their weight. This is terrible advice. All it does is make your data seven times less useful.\n\nIf you take this approach, you will not know if your weight is going up or down at all for three to four weeks, and it will take you three months to know how fast or slow you are using weight.\n\nIf you have come to the point where you have decided that optimization is right for you, you need to train yourself to take the data daily, but focus on the averages.\n\nIf you are an expert optimizer, you might play around with single-day experiments, but in general you should ignore single-day data and focus on averages over time.\n\nNever Second-Guess Your Data\n\nI have seen many people take a glucose measurement. It’s too high! They take another. It went down. Oh good, it wasn’t as high as the first number said it was.\n\nYou cannot do this. Accept your data as-is.\n\nYou must always pre-specify your approach and then stick to it.\n\nWhy? Because violating what you have pre-specified introduces bias. If you take a finger prick glucose measurement and it is 99, and then because it is higher than you like you take another one and it comes in at 94, you have turned an unbiased measurement into a biased one.\n\nThe bias is this: you never took a second measurement because you liked it too much or it was too normal; you only took a second measurement when you didn’t like the first. That bias will lead you to overestimate how normal your measurements are and underestimate how abnormal they are because you are only second-guessing the abnormal ones.\n\nIf you suspect you have a problem with your data collection instrument, the solution to this is to perform a separate validation experiment with calibration fluids or with multiple pricks of different fingers or comparisons to ear lobe data or whatever you want to test. It is not to second-guess and repeat just the measurements you didn’t like.\n\nI have also seen some people decide to do three measurements and take the average. While there is nothing wrong with doing this, you have to realize that if you are optimizing something you are going to have to take a lot more than three measurements. You may well increase your precision by taking the average of three measurements, but it may not be worth your time when you are going to have a larger number of measurements across time to take the average of. Regardless, if you do take the average of three measurements, you have to do it every day, or in a pattern that you have pre-specified, not just on days where you don’t like the first measurement.\n\nMeasure What Matters: Example\n\nAs an example, I track my energy at the end of each workday.\n\nI organize my tracking to be part of my workday. On rest days, I rest from tracking. As such, my definitions are centered around the interaction between my physical fitness and my work productivity.\n\nMy ratings assume that I was able to keep up with my workout volume, but this part is circular, because I design my workout volume around what I can tolerate without experiencing a reduction in my work productivity.\n\nI rate myself at the end of each day.\n\nHere are my pre-specified definitions:\n\n1 — I struggled to find the motivation to work.\n\n2 — I got a solid six to ten hours of work in, but much of it was spent lying down.\n\n3 — I got a solid six to ten hours of work in, and all of it was upright, but not necessarily active.\n\n4 — I got a solid six to ten hours of work in, and at least 2-3 hours of it was spent in activity. For example, I worked while walking at 1.4 miles per hour on my treadmill, or in an active lunge with a straight-side glute contraction and a flexed-side hamstring contraction, or in a half lotus (which is a serious hip stretch for me), or in some other position.\n\n5 — I got a solid six to ten hours of work in, and nearly all of it was spent in activity, and two to three hours of it were spent in double-activity. An example of double activity would be walking at 1.4 miles per hour on my treadmill while also doing a core contraction and practicing breathing into my upper back or doing a single side stretch of my shoulder, arm and fingers while the other hand controls my scrolling during reading.\n\nMy experience is that if my energy level is abundant, I can do many things with my body with plenty left over for my mind. If my energy level is scarce, doing any type of activity is extremely distracting to my mind. So, I prioritize putting myself in the physical position that allows my cognitive work to get done, and I rate my energy by how conservative I had to be or liberal I was able to be with my physical activity while getting that cognitive work done.\n\nYou may have a very different work style or a very different level of energy, so you might pick a totally different set of definitions.\n\nThe point is to pre-specify the definitions that are relevant to you, write them out clearly, and hold yourself to them.\n\nMake a spreadsheet in Google Sheets, Excel, or a suitable alternative.\n\nEach day is a row. Make a column for each measurement, and label the column appropriately. Freeze the top row so that the labels are always visible even if you have many rows of data.\n\nPut the definitions for your self-rated tracking items in the top row so that they are easily accessed every time you rate yourself. You can either hide them in the column header of that item so that you view them by double clicking, or you can put them off to the right side so that you can scroll horizontally to see them.\n\nIn this example, the width of “Energy” is adjusted so that you can only see the column title without double clicking. Once you double click, it opens up the definition. This was made simply by putting the definition right after the column title but not selecting any text wrapping and adjusting the column width so that only the label could be seen.\n\nIn this example, by contrast, I put the definition of energy on the right-hand side, wrapped the text, and widened the column enough for it to appear in paragraph form.\n\nEither of these are fine and you could in fact combine them if you wanted to. The point is that you need the definitions very precise, to the point, and easy to check so that you can hold yourself to them over time.\n\nMajor protocol changes, such as changing the dose of something or adding something, should be added intermittently in their own column.\n\nYour protocol changes are the independent variables of the scientific experiment you are performing on yourself.\n\nYou will likely want a “notes” column at the end that serves as a journal for anything notable that doesn’t fit in another column. However, you have to be conscious that if you write a lot in the notes section, you aren’t going to read it very often.\n\n—> Anything important as an outcome should be a number, not a note.\n\n—> Anything important as a protocol change should be six to seven words max, and should be infrequently noted because you shouldn’t be changing your protocol every day.\n\nFor example, “increased creatine from 3g to 4g” might be in the Protocol Changes column, and two weeks later you might write “increased creatine from 4g to 5g.” Or you could simply call them “Creatine 3g,” “Creatine 4g” and “Creatine 5g.” You can then compare, say, your average sleep on 3 grams versus 4 grams versus 5 grams in about 30 seconds, but you could never interpret all your daily notes in 30 seconds.\n\nThe main purpose of the notes is to look through or keyword search in the future if you ever get stuck on an interpretation, or if you fundamentally change how you view something you had been recording in your notes and need to collect all the instances you mentioned it. Or you can add what you were thinking that made you change your protocol in case you forget why you did something. You might also list notable confounders in this section so that if your primary interpretation of something doesn’t pan out you can go back and look at the confounders to see if they help reveal a secondary interpretation.\n\nThe main point is this: take the notes, but consider them extra, not something constituting your primary data to analyze.\n\nClick below to download the Ultimate Optimization Spreadsheet:\n\nDo not open it in Excel or any other desktop program.

For example, your diet and supplements can be tracked in Cronometer and your workout could be tracked in an app like Jefit or, if you work with a trainer, Everfit.\n\nIf you run lab data that is impossible to run daily, such as the data that comes with an annual checkup or your own self-organized quarterly lab testing, this can live in the lab portal. For example, Quest now does a great job keeping track of your results and formatting them as change-over-time line graphs.\n\nIf you are testing dietary components, you really should consider Cronometer tracking mandatory. If you don’t want to put in the time weighing out your food and tracking it meticulously each day, you should just sit down for ten minutes and log what you consider to be your likely intake of foods over the course of a month into one single day, and generate the nutrient report for the entire month, giving you at least a general idea of what your micronutrient intakes average to over the course of a month.\n\nYour optimization spreadsheet is for analyzing your primary outcome data (your dependent variables and your primary protocol changes (your independent variables) and does not need to have the totality of your regimen, as long as the totality of your regimen is easily accessible in one or several other places, you do not need to track it all in your spreadsheet.\n\nHowever, it should be available in such a way as to be able to easily characterize it for any time period that is relevant, and to be able to extract data if you decide they are relevant enough to include some portion of them in your spreadsheet for ease of comparison or visualization.\n\nIf you are a data junky, feel free to extract all of that background info into one giant spreadsheet, but this should not be in your optimization sheet. It should be a different file altogether or it should be its own tab within your health spreadsheet, with the optimization sheet being the main tab you use.\n\nYou should extract a variable from your background data into your primary spreadsheet if you believe it may be either a) an intermediary between your protocol and your outcome, or b) a confounder that complicates the interpretation of your protocol’s effects providing it also is a) variable enough that it is worth tracking daily and b) irregular enough that it doesn’t simply average out.\n\nFor example, say you are optimizing your sleep and are testing creatine. Your carb intake might not be part of your experiment, but it might vary quite a bit from day to day and you might become convinced its variability is influencing your sleep, acting as a confounder of the creatine. You may then want to be able to extract it from Cronometer into a column of your spreadsheet.\n\nHowever, if you keep your carb intake constant enough that its influence is muted, there is no point in extracting it to your spreadsheet, and if its ups and downs are so regularly cyclical that they average out over the relevant timespan — for example, your protocol steps are at least one week long and your average daily carb intake is roughly the same from week to week — then there is also no point in extracting it.\n\nSimilarly, you could be testing whether black seed oil increases your energy, and you expect that it could do so by lowering your inflammation, shifting iron from storage into the synthesis of energy utilization pathways. In that case, you should extract your annual or quarterly iron measurements into your optimization sheet, and should strongly consider measuring them more frequently to help optimize your dose of black seed oil.\n\nIf you can keep your background variables more controlled, it will help you get quicker results in your experiments.\n\nFor example, I eat the same thing every day weighed out to the gram on my workdays, and I relax my diet on my rest days. This allows me to change one thing in my diet and clearly distinguish its effect since nothing else in my diet is varying.\n\nYou do not have to do this.\n\nThe solution to greater background variability is to collect more data. Since you are only a single person, the only way to collect more data is to run the experiment for a longer period of time, giving you more days to measure.\n\nYou should assess the extent of this background variability. For example, if you eat a rotation of foods and the rotation is fairly consistent, then your intake will average out over the period of your rotations. If you rotate seven different dinners across a week, your weekly average intakes will even out. If you are less deliberate but do not have infinite appetite for variation, you are probably averaging out at least on a monthly basis.\n\nIf your dietary variability is clearly adding noise to the variable you are tracking, simply extend your experimental trials so that they span the spectrum of variability. If your diet tends to repeat week after week, make your dietary interventions so that each trial lasts at least a week. If your diet tends to repeat month after month, make them last a month.\n\nIf you are optimizing something that is clearly influenced by your menstrual cycle, you are going to need each experimental trial to last through at least an entire menstrual cycle.\n\nHaving chosen what to optimize as an outcome and having set up your data tracking correctly, you now must choose what to test as an intervention. This could be one of the steps in any of my Protocols Series, or it could be something from ancestral traditions, something someone recommended, something that you found a scientific study supporting, or something you came up with yourself based on biochemical reasoning or intuition.\n\nMake a very brief description of the intervention you are testing and include it in the “Protocol Changes” column of your sheet.\n\nMake sure to also log it wherever you are keeping the full regimen of its category logged. For example, if it is a dietary or supplement strategy and you track your diet and supplements in Cronometer, make sure to also log the change in your Cronometer.\n\nIf you test more than one thing at a time, you will not know which thing is responsible for any effect you observe.\n\nIsolating your changes to one intentional change at a time does not automatically give you a robust ability to determine causation, but it does remove the major barriers to such a determination that are under your control.\n\nAs covered in the Background Data section, you will still have many confounders operating in the background. Your job is to carry out each trial long enough to let these confounders average out so that your signal rises above the background noise.\n\nThis does not mean you have to test one isolated nutrient at a time. Testing a multivitamin, a B complex, or an infinitely more complex whole food, is a completely valid test. However, you must make your inferences about the things you are testing. For example, adding pizza is testing “pizza,” not “carbs.” Adding a Thorne Basic 2/Day Multivitamin is adding that specific multivitamin, not just any multivitamin and certainly not one of its nutrients. The point is, you are not adding a multivitamin and adding pizza to increase your “carbs” and then trying to determine which one is causing the subsequent changes in your health that you observe.\n\nIf you add pizza and you hypothesize that its effects are due to the extra calcium in the cheese, and you want to be able to know if that is true, you can run subsequent trials for other forms of cheese providing the same amount of calcium, or for other food sources of calcium such as bone meal, or for isolated calcium supplements. You do not need to test these things, but if you want to be able to know it is “calcium” that produced the result, you will have test them to properly form that conclusion.\n\nThere are many synergies involved in nutrition. They are complex and require expertise to understand. This can be self-made expertise. It does not require a degree to understand, but it requires considerable study.\n\nIn my Protocols, I combine items into a single step when I believe their synergy outweighs the value of testing them separately.\n\nIf you do not have adequate expertise to judge what is synergistic and what is not, it is best to defer to whole foods, supplement formulations on the market, and expertise you are able to tap into through your network or online.\n\nAs a general rule, trying to increase a vitamin or mineral through food offers a major margin of safety against violating a principle of synergy that you could very easily violate with a supplement.\n\nMoving very slowly through dose ranges as advocated below offers another margin of safety.\n\nYou can obtain another margin of safety simply by grouping nutrients together by class. You can expect that all nutrients have some potential synergy with each other, which makes a high-quality multivitamin one of the safest supplements to try. B vitamins all have intimate interactions, so a B complex is safer than an isolated B vitamin. The groupings in Testing Nutritional Status: The Ultimate Cheat Sheet can further help you see synergies to expect based on the overarching categories into which nutrients are placed.\n\nWhatever your intervention is, no matter how simple or complex, define exactly what it is, make your inferences exactly about it, not some fanciful assumption about the broader thing it is meant to represent, and isolate your intentional changes to that one thing. Allow your trial to go on long enough to ensure all the things outside of your control in the background average out over time.\n\nYou can expect everything in life to have a dose-response curve that looks something like this:\n\nAt a low enough dose, it is doing nothing.\n\nSomewhere after that you have some sort of dose-response curve where a bigger dose gives you more benefit.\n\nYou then experience 1) diminishing returns, where an increase in dose still gives you more benefit but the slope becomes less steep, 2) a plateau, where increasing the dose does nothing, 3) a loss of the original benefit, and then 4) an adverse effect.\n\nThe curve can thus be broken into six major sections:\n\nThere may be things in life where we do not see the full curve play out, but this is probably because we lack experience of certain doses. For example, there might be some degree of lead exposure that is beneficial through the principle of hormesis — the concept that a little bit of something bad is good for you by stimulating your adaptive defenses — but this might be underneath the lowest possible exposure in the modern environment and therefore be irrelevant. Or, we might lack the willingness to study this due to the downside consequences of being wrong about the dose.\n\nNevertheless, we can assume that the general principles of this curve play out across all things, and the practical point is that they are going to play out for anything that we are actually going to test on ourselves.\n\nThis could apply to resistance training and hypertrophy. Not enough stimulus, no adaptation. Within some range, more sets, more muscle growth. Then, a marginal set does give you more muscle growth, but a lot less additional benefit than the previous number of sets gave you: diminishing returns. At some point you are overreaching and then overtraining and you are stressing your body out so much that you compromise its ability to grow or even wind up in a straight-up catabolic state.\n\nThis could apply to time management. You can spend so little effort analyzing your time management that you learn nothing. At some dose, you start learning how to manage your time more efficiently and have remaining bandwidth to execute on your new insights. At some greater dose you spent so much time analyzing how you spend your time that you had no time left to actually do anything.\n\nIt applies to everything.\n\nWith a vitamin that has a toxicity syndrome, such as vitamin B6, it is more obvious that at some dose you get into “harm.” What is less obvious is that any nutrient can ultimately cause imbalances if its dose gets too high. For example, if you pound fat-burning nutrients like B2, B5, and CoQ10, you could eventually wind up in a state where you are burning more fat than your body would otherwise deem appropriate and this might hurt your skin by draining its lipid content or hurt your glucose metabolism by constantly shoving fatty acids in the way of your carbohydrate oxidation pathways.\n\nMany people say you want to use “the minimal effective dose.”\n\nIt depends how you interpret this phrase. It sounds on the surface like it would put you here:\n\nIf you interpret this as “the minimal effective dose necessary to achieve the desired outcome,” then that would presumably put you at the beginning of the plateau point, since your desired outcome should be maximal benefit:\n\nHowever, my position is that you want to arrive just before the point of diminishing returns:\n\nThe way you get there is you titrate up until you hit diminishing returns, then pull back to the most recent dose that provide a large, obvious benefit.\n\nIf you interpret “minimal effective dose” to mean “the minimal effective dose to achieve the closest thing you can to maximal benefit while also maintaining the largest window of safety from loss of benefit and adverse effect which puts you at the point just shy of diminishing returns” then by all means call this “the minimal effective dose.”\n\nThe reason you want to be at this point is that this gives you nearly all of the benefit and gives you an extra margin of safety against an adverse effect.\n\nThink of it this way: you are climbing up a hill. When you get to the summit, you can walk around a little on the flat top. However, walk a little further and you are on the edge of a cliff. One misstep and you can fall.\n\nThe primary misstep you are likely to have made here is that your view of how long you had to spend hiking up the hill to actually know where you landed had been unrealistically short. You think by holding the dose steady you are staying in the same place, but actually you are slowly drifting toward a higher and higher cumulative body store of the nutrient over time, and slowly upregulating pathways that are either designed to get rid of the extra or use what is available toward some purpose. If you stabilize before the plateau, you have a large margin where you can slip forward and nothing bad happens. If you stabilize on the edge of the plateau, however, your margin of safety is much smaller and you are more likely to stumble your way into an adverse effect over time.\n\nMore guidance will be given on how long to spend in each trial in the next section.\n\nFirst, we clarify some more points in how to determine where on this graph you are.\n\nYour initial dose should always be the lowest expected to have any effect.\n\nIf what you are testing is a well characterized nutrient found in food, your lowest dose should be based on the dietary reference intakes characterizing the basic requirements for the nutrient and, if available, studies suggesting variation in the amount derived from eating different foods impacts health outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, if basic requirements are not well characterized or not characterized at all, the lowest dose should be based on randomized controlled trials showing human health outcomes of particular doses when available, and otherwise from case reports or anecdotal experience.\n\nIn my Protocols, I synthesize all these types of evidence to use the best available evidence for the purpose and characterize the most probable dose range to work within to gain the proposed benefit.\n\nHowever, your requirement will not always and not even usually be the average requirement derived from existing studies.\n\nRather, you use the available data as a starting point and then you determine your requirement by slowly titrating the dose to just shy of the point of diminishing returns that you personally experience in the context of performing this scientific experiment on yourself.\n\nThe increment of your dose increases should match your starting dose.\n\nFor example, if you start with 6 milligrams of riboflavin per day, your next increment should be 12, and then 18, and so on.\n\nYou can then modify this according to your results. Specifically, if your initial dose does nothing and you determine that you are beneath the primary benefit curve, you can speed up your dose increase until you start seeing a benefit. Once you see the benefit, slow down.\n\nOne of the problems with interpreting dose increases is that a higher dose allows you to fix a deficiency faster, but once it is fixed, the higher dose is just a bunch of extra over your maintenance requirement. In these cases, it can help to use a loading dose or what I sometimes call a “flush” to flush maximal levels of the nutrient through your body over a short timeframe.\n\nThis is well characterized with creatine, where four to five days of 20 grams per day leads to muscle saturation that otherwise takes a month of 2-3 grams per day. When you know this to be the case, you want to reach muscle saturation in either one of these ways and then use a bottom-up slow dose titration to determine your optimal maintenance dose.\n\nThe purpose of this is just to clear out any state of “deficiency” as fast as you can so that the time you spend titrating your dose is used efficiently to find your maintenance requirement.\n\nIf you add a supplement or increase the dose and nothing happens, there are essentially two possibilities.\n\nOne is you are beneath the point of primary benefit:\n\nAnother is that you are moving along the plateau point:\n\nThe only real way to know the difference is to increase the dose and see if you get a benefit or an adverse effect.\n\nIf you had started at the plateau point as your baseline, you have already accrued the benefit, so as you move on to the loss of benefit part of the curve, it will be experienced as an adverse effect.\n\nUltimately, you should derive the probability that one or other is true based on what is known from existing literature and human experience about the dose you are using. I continually update my Protocols to give you my best understanding of what to expect, so if you are using one, the bottom of the dose range should put you near the bottom of the primary benefit, not the top, so if nothing a happens your best assumption is that you need to increase the dose more to obtain the benefit.\n\nHowever, if you are working on your own, it is easy to be misled. For example, there are many studies of riboflavin using 100 to 400 milligrams per day, but there are almost none testing 400 milligrams per day head to head against 3-5 milligrams per day and there are never any studies that give lower doses of vitamins extra time to work than the higher doses, which is what you need to do to truly show superiority of the higher dose. Go figure, what is primarily tested is never what actually needs to be known.\n\nMy current research is leading me to believe that almost no one has long-term maintenance needs for riboflavin above 5-6 milligrams per day, and most genetic factors that increase the riboflavin requirement above the population average move it from 1.6 milligrams per day to 3.2 milligrams per day.\n\nIf you decide to test the effect of riboflavin on your cramps and you have been consuming five milligrams of riboflavin per day from food for the last five years, there’s a pretty good chance that additional riboflavin will do nothing and it’s because you have already accrued the benefit of higher-than-average riboflavin intakes.\n\nBy contrast, if you are consuming the population average of 1.6 milligrams per day of riboflavin, or less than that, or you have only been consuming five milligrams per day for a month or two, there is a high chance that boosting your riboflavin gives you additional upside.\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot rule out that there are rare genetic mutations that really do require 400 milligrams per day. So I include this as an upper dose in my protocols, but also make it clear that the average person probably tops out the benefit at 5-6 milligrams per day.\n\nUltimately, the only way to know where you are is to continue the test to see if dose increases make things better or worse.\n\nAnother interpretive problem is that we don’t know whether an adverse effect is an intrinsic problem with the dose or is due to a contextual factor being out of balance.\n\nFor example, you may experience an “adverse effect” by fixing a problem too fast and your body needs to undergo various adjustments to allow the fix to operate in a way that provides a clean experience of a benefit.\n\nFor example, you may be deficient in creatine and this is leading to whole-body intracellular potassium depletion because you cannot efficiently use cellular energy in the form of ATP to bring potassium inside of cells. Too much creatine too fast could start fixing this, making potassium go into your cells and causing the serum levels to drop, causing heart palpitations. Your potassium supply becomes the relevant contextual factor, and you can either a) drop the creatine dose to move potassium into your cells more slowly, b) wait it out and allow your body to adjust, which might take weeks or even months, or c) supply the extra potassium so that you have enough to go around.\n\nIf there are predictable contextual factors that could be driven out of balance while fixing a problem, I include them as if-then contingency plans in my protocols.\n\nIf you are unsure, you can simply treat it as an adverse effect. If you hit an adverse effect, you pull back on the dose.\n\nIf you immediately hit an adverse effect at the lowest dose, cut it in half or a third. Keep going down to the lowest practical dose to see if you can find the “primary benefit” part of the curve. If you cannot find a dose that has benefits without adverse effects, discard the strategy.\n\nIn order to properly find the point of diminishing returns, your dose increments have to be small enough to not pop you suddenly from “primary benefit” to “adverse effect,” and you have to move slowly enough so that you determine the effect of any given dose based on its final resting point, not a snapshot of your health in motion as the dose moves you from one point to another. That means that any health changes you observe must fully stabilize before moving from one dose to the next, or from one protocol step to the next.\n\nIn the next section, we look at how to determine how long you give any dose to show its final effects.\n\nThe most important point to take away from this current section is this: start with the lowest dose that has plausible efficacy, titrate up as slowly as is practical until you hit diminishing returns, then pull back to the last dose that had a large benefit.\n\nWhenever you make a change, there are biochemical, molecular, cellular, physiological, and epigenetic changes that are distributed over different time horizons. Some of these happen over fractions of a second, some over minutes, some over hours, and some over days. This is complicated by the fact that any effect has knock-on effects that are secondary, tertiary, and so on, cascading into changes with their own time horizons. At some point we hit knock-on effect layers that we don’t know enough to predict and simply cannot guess their time horizons.\n\nSome of these could involve tissue remodeling, and these might take a longer time and be somewhat more stubborn.\n\nThe epigenetic fraction of these changes has the most variability in its time horizons. Many of these changes occur over a span of hours and ebb and flow with, for example, the fasting-feeding cycle. Others occur during development, and the window of time in which they occurred raises their perceived importance to render them permanent or at least quasi-permanent and difficult to reverse. It is likely that highly sustained signaling becomes progressively more difficult to reverse the longer it is sustained. For example, if you have a situation that persists for years, it could conceivably take years to reverse.\n\nEffects are often multi-phasic.\n\nFor example, during water fasting, you will deplete your liver glycogen over the course of 24 hours, and during the first day you will progressively shift from using stored carbohydrate (glycogen) to using newly synthesized carbohydrate (gluconeogenesis) over time. Your ketone synthesis will ramp up, but over 3-5 days ketones will shift from feeding muscles to feeding the brain, and muscles will shift from using ketones to using fatty acids. At five days, you are solidly “keto-adapted,” a position you have reached much more quickly than people using moderately ketogenic diets because water fasting is a much stronger stimulus for adaptation. Yet, as you get weeks into a water fast you will have a secondary phase of muscle catabolism, and as you get months into a water fast you will get into a fatal third phase.\n\nIf you take something less well-characterized, like 400 milligrams of riboflavin, you might have an early phase characterized by rapidly fixing a deficiency. You then may have a second phase that lasts weeks or months where you gradually increase your ability to burn fat. This might be net beneficial until it hits a tipping point 3-6 months in where it leads to lost fat in the face, creating a more hollowed out look; eczema from inadequate skin lipids; or progressively worsening glucose tolerance as fat begins to displace glucose as a preferred fuel but your carb intake has remained as high as it always was.\n\nThe longest randomized controlled trial of a dietary strategy in existence is the LA Veterans Administration Hospital Study, which looked at the impact of substituting “seed oils” for traditional fats. The initial benefit to cardiovascular disease wore off over the course of the eight years. The rise in cancer did not even start emerging until year two and mostly took off after year 5. The total mortality was unchanged throughout the study but looked at the end like it was starting to favor traditional fats around year eight. The authors concluded the trial wasn’t anywhere near long enough to see the true effect. This trial emphasizes that dietary impacts can take years to reveal their full effects.\n\nThe point here is that there are too many relevant time horizons for us to say definitively when an effect has truly stabilized, so when deciding how long to stay on a given dose you need to artfully mix the science of dose-response with the practicality you require.\n\nThere may be cases where we already know a lot about how long something should take to stabilize. In this case, we should initially assume as our base case that we are similar to other people. For example, we know how long creatine takes to saturate muscle stores and we know how long keto-adaptation takes. If we know we should expect these lead-in phases, we should let them run their course and then start the clock looking for stabilization.\n\nOnce we are beyond any expected lead-in requirement, I recommend giving any given dose at least one week.\n\nHowever, it then becomes your job to look for changes in your health and ensure they have the chance to stabilize.\n\nA week should allow most of the first-phase epigenetic changes to settle in. While there may be other phases down the road, they tend to be months out rather than linearly accumulating. If they are linearly accumulating, you will see this clearly in your health metrics failing to stabilize. If they are months out, you will waste too much time if you wait for them. You can always revisit your protocol if something seems to be out of balance by reducing the dose of something or eliminating it altogether if it seems to have run its course.\n\nYou can protect against benefit-to-adverse-effect transitions by avoiding megadoses unless they prove absolutely necessary, by focusing on foods instead of supplements, by being slow and methodical in your initial dose titration, by never ignoring adverse effects even if they are subtle, and by aiming for the point just shy of diminishing returns instead of the absolute maximal benefit, and by not blindly copying the dose that someone else on the internet is raving about.\n\nThere are various ways to assess whether something has stabilized.\n\nFirst, you want to take stock of what you already know about the variability in what you are measuring. For example, if it is your past experience that your deep sleep ranges from 1-2 hours per night and that when it hits 2 hours it often stays there for two weeks and then reverts back to the mean of 1.5, you must take that into account. If you decide that 5 milligrams per day of apigenin has increased your deep sleep from 1.75 hours a night to 2 hours a night, you cannot decide it has stabilized after one week of staying right at 2 hours a night when you know from past experience that your deep sleep often does that without apigenin. You will have to take this knowledge into account and impose a rule that your deep sleep hitting 2 hours a night does not even register as a signal above the noise until it surpasses your previous all-time best of two consistent weeks of 2 hours per night. Then you start the clock for it stabilizing.\n\nOnce you take into account your expected background variability, you can look for stabilization visually or mathematically. If you plot your data as a line graph, you can simply look at whether the line is straight, and whether it has clearly spent more time being straight than it usually does prior to having introduced your intervention or your current dose of that intervention. Or, whether it has some ups and downs but you could easily draw a straight line through the average of those ups and downs that is straighter than any previous line you could have drawn or simply is in a new, better place than any straight line you could have drawn through the data.\n\nThe way I prefer to do this is as follows:\n\nDetermine what margin of error you will tolerate. For example, say I want my morning glucose to be 78-85. If I’ve gotten it down to 82, I can probably tolerate a span of 3 points up or down for my own satisfaction.\n\nDetermine what margin of error you will tolerate. For example, say I want my morning glucose to be 78-85. If I’ve gotten it down to 82, I can probably tolerate a span of 3 points up or down for my own satisfaction.\n\nCalculate the 7-day rolling average, the 3-day rolling average, and the average for all measurements taken on that particular dose. If you are carrying the experiment on for more than a month, add to this the monthly average.\n\nCalculate the 7-day rolling average, the 3-day rolling average, and the average for all measurements taken on that particular dose. If you are carrying the experiment on for more than a month, add to this the monthly average.\n\nIf all the averages are within the accepted margin of error of each other, see if there is a trend from longer-term averages to shorter-term averages to your most recent measurement that all point in one direction. For example, If so, give yourself a little more time. If not, you have stabilized.\n\nIf all the averages are within the accepted margin of error of each other, see if there is a trend from longer-term averages to shorter-term averages to your most recent measurement that all point in one direction. For example, If so, give yourself a little more time. If not, you have stabilized.\n\nIf your averages are within the margin of error but all pointing in one direction, simply keep taking measurements until they are no longer pointing in a direction.\n\nIf your averages are within the margin of error but all pointing in one direction, simply keep taking measurements until they are no longer pointing in a direction.\n\nIf you see an initial adverse event, you can either immediately pull back on the dose, or you can give it three or four days for it to turn around. Never let an adverse effect keep getting worse for more than three or four days, and never let it get dangerously bad.\n\nIf you are seeing a benefit, stay on the dose until the duration and magnitude of benefit provide a clear signal that rises above the background noise and until the benefit stabilizes as assessed visually or mathematically.\n\nMove your dose up to the next increment, and stabilize again. Keep repeating this until you reach the point of diminishing returns, and pull back to the most recent dose before that. Then you can move on to your next strategy.\n\nThe Ultimate Optimization Spreadsheet automatically visualizes your daily data alongside the 3-day, 7-day, and 30-day averages and puts your protocol step average into a table. In this case, you want to see that the averages are clustering together and flat, and that there is no recent divergence from that pattern by the daily data or 3-day average.\n\nIf you arrive at some new level of health that has proven to be a stable benefit, some might question how sure you can be that your protocol is exactly what did that, but you have the benefit and that is what matters.\n\nSuppose, however, that you initially seem to have a solid benefit and it starts to lose its stability over time.\n\nYou may start questioning whether the effect was real.\n\nThis is a good time to consider performing a randomized controlled trial on yourself.\n\nFor many strategies, especially foods and exercise, it will be impossible to blind yourself and control with a placebo, even with the help of a friend or professional. However, randomizing repeated periods will help evenly distribute the confounders across your trials and will give you a much better ability to make a conclusion about causation.\n\nYou should randomize when all of the following are true:\n\nYou are unsure about the effect of something despite having tried it using the approach outlined above.\n\nYou are unsure about the effect of something despite having tried it using the approach outlined above.\n\nIt seems plausible that there is an effect that is large enough to be worth doing this randomized trial to figure out.\n\nIt seems plausible that there is an effect that is large enough to be worth doing this randomized trial to figure out.\n\nThere is some downside to “just doing it anyway” such as time or money you don’t want to waste, or some tradeoff effect that you are also unsure about.\n\nThere is some downside to “just doing it anyway” such as time or money you don’t want to waste, or some tradeoff effect that you are also unsure about.\n\nThe timeline on which you expect to observe the effect, including any lead-in time required for the effect to onset and any washout time needed for the effect to stop persisting after you stop the intervention, is one you are willing to repeat some six to twelve times.\n\nThe timeline on which you expect to observe the effect, including any lead-in time required for the effect to onset and any washout time needed for the effect to stop persisting after you stop the intervention, is one you are willing to repeat some six to twelve times.\n\nOne example could be that you believe that 200 grams of net carbs per day leads to a half hour better sleep than 100 grams of net carbs on the same night you consume them, but you have about two hours of variability in your sleep that are determined by whether your kids wake you up during any given night. Every time you think you are going to see this stabilize, your kids start waking you up more, so you really aren’t sure you’re right.\n\nIn this case you expect the carb influence to act on a one-day time horizon, and 30 minutes of extra sleep is actually very meaningful, but you are having trouble distinguishing that 30 minutes from the much larger variability caused by the kids.\n\nIf you randomize your carbohydrate intake, you can effectively separate it from the influenced of the ups and downs of your kids, and do a statistical test to give greater confidence.\n\nIf your kids are acting in a multi-day cycle where any two days in a row they are acting relatively similarly, you can do a paired statistical analysis where each pair of opposite-carb days are matched with one another to increase the statistical power.\n\nOr, let’s say you are investigating the same question but your menstrual cycle impacts your sleep even more than the carbs. You can do a paired statistical analysis where each pair of opposite-carb days occurs within a tight two-day block of your menstrual cycle, allowing the stats to automatically control for your cycle.\n\nIf you know you have a regular, cyclical variable as a confounder, you can also do post-hoc analyses where you visually inspect the data to see if, for example, carbs only add to your sleep during ovulation, or if they benefit your sleep in the follicular phase and hurt it in the luteal phase.\n\nYou will need to randomize blocks of time that allow your effect to take place. If it takes you four weeks to keto-adapt, and a keto diet benefits your sleep after the four-week time point, and it takes one week to unwind the keto-adaptation, you are going to have to randomize 7-week periods just to get one solid week of keto-sleep. You might consider this deeply impractical.\n\nSimilarly, if you are trying to build muscle, it might take you twelve weeks of a program to get any measurable sign of progress, and if you randomize pairs of training regimens it could take you years to get clear differences. This is effectively impossible, or at least a ridiculously unwise strategy compared to tweaking your training regimen with expected improvements every twelve weeks and keeping what seems to work while discarding what doesn’t.\n\nOr you might have to make an executive decision around something that seems a bit inconvenient but could be practical if the information is valuable enough. For example, if your observational period indicated that you can consume a pound of beef per day for four days before it starts increasing your anxiety, and the effect washes out after two days of no beef, you will need to randomize pairs of one-week periods just to get one day of beef-induced anxiety. This might take a while, but if you are genuinely unsure whether otherwise seemingly random panic attacks are driven by beef consumption this might be very important to you and well worth randomizing.\n\nHere is how to randomize:\n\nFirst, determine whether you fit the bullet point criteria outlined above and only randomize if each bullet point is true.\n\nFirst, determine whether you fit the bullet point criteria outlined above and only randomize if each bullet point is true.\n\nDetermine what your intervention and control is. If you are adding something new, your control is without it and your intervention is with it. If you are increasing the dose of something, your control is the lower dose and your intervention is the higher dose. If you are simply changing from an old protocol to a new one, your old protocol is the control and your new one is the intervention.\n\nDetermine what your intervention and control is.

This is the target you are trying to optimize.\n\nDetermine from your observational period (that is, your attempt to try the regimen and stabilize on it as outlined in the previous three sections) whether there is a necessary lead-in time (the time on the intervention until the effect onsets or stabilizes) or washout time (the time off the intervention before the effect wears off). Make the periods you are randomizing long enough to get your observed effect after any necessary lead-in time, and schedule any necessary washout periods between your randomized periods.\n\nDetermine from your observational period (that is, your attempt to try the regimen and stabilize on it as outlined in the previous three sections) whether there is a necessary lead-in time (the time on the intervention until the effect onsets or stabilizes) or washout time (the time off the intervention before the effect wears off). Make the periods you are randomizing long enough to get your observed effect after any necessary lead-in time, and schedule any necessary washout periods between your randomized periods.\n\nDetermine how many pairs of periods you will randomize. As a default, I recommend doing six randomized pairs, so 12 total intervention periods.\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile in setting this up for statistical success, you can use a sample size calculator. If you arrived at the randomized controlled trial because you did an observational (try it, track it, and see if it works) period first that produced confusing results, this is your preliminary data. Your preliminary data will be sequential over time rather than paired, but you are going to be randomizing pairs of trial periods. Your preliminary data from the observational period will be more fit to use for a parallel design sample size calculator, while a paired t test sample size calculator might actually be better for your trial design.\n\nMy recommendation would be to use the parallel design calculator and be aware that this might recommend a higher number of pairs than you actually need. This is a good thing, however, because it ensures better stats. Use your spreadsheet to calculate the average and standard deviation of your primary outcome for your control condition and your intervention condition. If the standard deviations are considerably different, use the condition with the larger standard deviation for “group 1” and use the one with the smaller standard deviation for group 2. Fill in the average and standard deviation for group 1, and the average for group 2. If you want to err on the side of a more burdensome study to gain more statistical power, shift the power from 80% to 90% and change the alpha from 0.05 to 0.01. Otherwise leave them at their default settings. Then click “calculate.” The total number per group is the number of pairs you have to randomize.\n\nIf the number of pairs recommended seems impractical, try this: pre-specify that you will analyze your data at the half-way point. If you have convincing results you will stop the trial there. If you have results that seem promising but uncertain, you will carry it on until the full number of trial periods have been finished.\n\nDetermine how many pairs of periods you will randomize.

You can randomize by flipping a coin or by using a random number generator. Assign one order to heads and the other to tails if you are flipping a coin; assign one order to 1 and the other to 2 if you are using a random number generator. Write these down before you flip the coin or use the generator. Since we have a small number of trials, I like to pre-specify that every order is used an equal number of times. With this rule, the coin or the generator is used to determine the sequence up until the point where one order has already occupied half of the slots; after this point, the other order is used for the remainder of the slots. With the rules in place, flip the coin repeatedly until you’ve determined your full sequence. Or, set a random number generator to a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2 and hit “generate” until you’ve determined your full sequence. Write down the details of how you randomized, what rules you pre-specified, what the actual coin flips or random numbers were in what sequence, and how you translated that into your trial order.\n\nNEVER ignore coin flips or random numbers generated or keep hitting them extra times. Either your rules were pre-specified or you need to start all over if you messed something up. Once you modify the design post-hoc, you have introduced bias.

Use the “Protocol Change” to note your randomized experiment and which trial period you are on in any given day. Keep track of your experimental design and results in a second tab of your sheet dedicated to that experiment. Copy over the relevant data from the first sheet to the second so that the second sheet has your experiment organized according to your experimental design.

For example, if something added 20 minutes of sleep that is probably a good gain, especially if you feel more well rested in the morning or more energetic during the day, and that is more important than the statistical significance. Ultimately, however, that is something you have to judge based on your own values and desires and what costs might be incurred by carrying out the intervention over the long-term.\n\nAt the end of your experiment, calculate the averages for the control and intervention so that you can assess whether the effect is meaningful to you.

Choose “enter or paste up to 2000 rows.” You can then copy and paste from your spreadsheet the control values in the group 1 column and the intervention values in the group 2 column.\n\nYou should now reflect on how “paired” your pairs were. On the one hand, you randomized the pairs so you are completely justified in using a paired t-test. On the other hand, you probably only have genuine biologically significant pairing if you have real trends over time that were impacting your primary endpoint. For example, if your menstrual cycle impacts the trials and they were all done in one month, each pair will be tightly tied to a specific part of your menstrual cycle and pairing makes a lot of sense. If you did your trial in March and it was the first month of the year you spent outside, you might have cumulatively increasing vitamin D status and other benefits of sunlight exposure and each pair of trials will be tightly tied to a specific point of that accumulation. Pairing again makes a lot of sense. On the other hand, if no such cycles existed and you have a lot of random variation that hit you randomly across your experiment and never lasted more than one day at a time, pairing might not be best. You can try the calculator with both “unpaired t test” and “paired t test” and see what makes the most sense to you.\n\nIf you use a paired test, you have to enter the data at the level you randomized. For example, if you randomize pairs of ten-day periods, you need to enter the average for each ten-day period instead of the daily data, and the 10-day periods that were paired with one another need need to occupy the same position in their respective columns of data.\n\nIn general, getting below 0.05 is considered statistically significant, but this cutoff is arbitrary. Your goal is to convince yourself, not publish this in peer review, so you can be a bit liberal in your interpretation of the stats. A lower p value gives you higher confidence your results are real.\n\nThe calculator gives “two-tailed” results. This assumes that your results could be different in either direction. If you have a strong hypothesis about the direction of your experiment and would be willing to give up the ability to test whether the opposite result were true, you can cut the p value in half to get “one-tailed” results, which will be much more likely to be statistically significant.\n\nUse the Graphpad t-test calculator to test for statistical significance.

Don’t randomize again until “try it, track it, and let it stabilize” gives you another set of confusing results that are worth randomizing.\n\nRandomized Self-Experiment: An Example\n\nIn my own optimization studies, I found that 24-hour whole wheat sourdough seemed to better promote sleep than white rice, nixtamalized corn, Ezekiel bread, or any other carb source I had tried when equating for net carbs. However, I had found this intermittently without intentionally testing it.\n\nUnfortunately, I have also determined that anything with fructans in it hurts my gastrointestinal function to at least a mild degree, and this made 24-hour whole wheat sourdough a tradeoff due to its fructan content.\n\nNixtamalized corn has proven to be the whole-food carb source I can best tolerate as a generic source of carbs if I am to, for example, replace fat calories with carb calories without a big impact on other aspects of my diet.\n\nThinking the impact of sourdough on my sleep was probably real, I considered that its pro-methylation potential due to its choline and trimethylglycine (betaine) could be responsible. The only other carb source with that type of pro-methylation profile is quinoa, due to its high trimethylglycine content. The main downside of quinoa is its substantial oxalate content.\n\nI tried replacing corn with quinoa, and I tried comparing this to replacing fat sources with enough extra egg yolks to equate the sum of choline and betaine.\n\nMy initial results made it look like quinoa was unique in optimizing my sleep, but may have also been hurting my energy:\n\nSleep is in total hours per night and energy is self-rated as described earlier.\n\nHowever, the longer I stayed on the quinoa the more this differential seemed to collapse:\n\nWhen I looked over the data, it appeared to me that these ebbs and flows could more easily have been explained by the fact that I was increasing my calories after transitioning from a leaning-out to a weight-maintenance phase, that my workouts were being adjusted according to my current goals, thereby impacting how much recovery I was needing, and that my sleep was largely following how much I needed rather than how much I was able to get.\n\nThe results seemed sufficiently confounded and confusing that I decided to randomize.\n\nI did not conduct a power calculation. Instead, I decided to run six pairs of trials with equal numbers of corn-quinoa trials as quinoa-corn trials.\n\nSince I do food prep in batches that last four days, each pair of trials lasted eight days, either with four days of corn and then four days of quinoa or with four days of quinoa and then four days of corn.\n\nI pre-specified that I would have an equal number of each order, and used a random number generator to generate the sequence. 1 meant corn first, 2 meant quinoa first. The random number generator gave me the sequence 2,1,1,2,2. Since there was only one slot left and 2 had already been used three times, the last spot automatically went to 1 by virtue of my rule. This led to 2,1,1,2,2,1, which translated to quinoa, corn, corn, quinoa, corn, quinoa, quinoa, corn, quinoa, corn, corn, quinoa.\n\nI did not observe any trends indicating a need for a lead-in period or a washout period, so the trials straightforwardly reflected my four-day food prep cycle.\n\nSince I am randomizing blocks of four corn day then four quinoa day versus blocks of four quinoa days then four corn days, and because the main purpose of the pairing is to avoid heavy clustering of the trials over time, the data can either be analyzed at the daily level in a unpaired t-test or in the four-day block level in a paired t-test. The idea behind pairing is that any given eight-day period had something similar within itself that was generally different in the other 8-day periods, and that might line up to something like the ebb and flow of my workout and recovery periods.\n\nMy trial is currently 83% complete, and these are the preliminary results:\n\nThe sleep is not even close to statistically significant at p=0.57 for an unpaired test and nearly identical results for a paired test.\n\nMy energy difference is not statistically significant, but it is a lot closer, reaching 0.24 or 0.25 depending on whether I use pairing. These are two-tailed t-tests, which aim to express equal skepticism toward quinoa helping or hurting my energy. Given that my initial results suggested quinoa hurt my energy and that I could attribute this to its oxalate load, I think it is fair to say I had a specific one-sided hypothesis and could use a one-sided t-test, which would be half the p value of a two-sided test and be 0.12.\n\nThis means that there is a 12% chance I would have observed results with an energy difference equal to or greater than this if quinoa has no genuine impact on my energy.\n\nFor my purposes, I conclude that quinoa does mildly hurt my energy. This wouldn’t fly in a peer reviewed paper, but my odds are 88% versus 12% so I’ll take the 88%.\n\nI do intend to finish the last two trials to arrive at the final stats, but I am leaning toward excluding quinoa from my default food selection and keeping corn.\n\nA note about the sample size calculations. In my preliminary data, my sleep after eating quinoa was higher on average, but it was also more volatile. Had I used my preliminary standard deviation for a sample size calculation, it would have told me to randomize 23 pairs. One downside to using the sample size calculation is that if you are purposefully running a randomized experiment, your standard deviation will probably go down. For example, if I use my current standard deviation within my experiment alongside the preliminary group averages from my observational data, it suggests I need 12 pairs to make a 7.0 versus 7.57-hour sleep difference statistically significant. This is twice what I have but half as many as the preliminary results would have suggested. Thus, if you get a wildly high number for the sample size calculation you can probably cut it in half if you practice rigorous controlling of variables during your randomized experiment.\n\nAgain, a good compromise here is to take the number recommended, and pre-specify that you will analyze your data at the half way point and stop if the results are convicning.\n\nYou don’t want to stop at a random point you didn’t pre-specify, because this will create bias by making you likely to stop whenever the results look the way you want them to.\n\nAt this point, the difference in my sleep has collapsed to 0.1 hour or six minutes. That won’t become significant by doubling the number of trials and I wouldn’t care if it did, because six minutes of sleep isn’t worth changing my diet over.\n\nBy contrast, the p value for the difference in energy might stay as low or decline in value further after completing the last leg of the experiment, and while it might not reach statistical significance, I expect the odds will continue to favor corn over quinoa for energy, which is convincing enough for me to stick to corn as a default carb source.\n\nNevertheless the primary conclusion from this experiment is that the initial perception that quinoa was helping my sleep was wrong, and I effectively refuted my hypothesis quinoa would increase my sleep due to its choline and betaine content.\n\nYou are done optimizing once you are getting the results you want or you have run out of strategies.\n\nIf you are now getting the results you want, revert to “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.” You should take a rest from changing things, and should focus on maintaining your results.\n\nIf you are doubtful that everything you have accumulated into your regimen is necessary for those results, you can use this optimization protocol to slim down your regimen. Focus on stability of your previous optimization targets as you use the exact same protocol framework to remove things instead of adding them.\n\nOnce you are confident in your ability to maintain your benefits, you are now free to exit the optimization sequence, or to pick another optimization target. If you pick a new optimization target, you should still track your previously optimized targets. Make sure optimizing your new target either doesn’t interfere with your previous gains, or only does so in a way and at a magnitude that you are willing to accept as a tradeoff.\n\nIf you are not yet happy with your results but you have run out of strategies, you may want to take a rest and “deload” from optimizing. Once you feel rested and ready to go again, focus on studying and learning until you find something new to “try and see if it works” or to use with this optimization protocol.\n\nOver the long-term, you may find that a particular strategy wears off or that your needs have changed, or that something that was helping you for a period of time is now hurting you.\n\nIf a strategy wears off you may simply need a new one. If your needs changed, you may need to optimize with a different target in mind. If something that helped you short-term is hurting you long-term, you should use this optimization protocol to test the impact of removing it the way you tested the original impact of including it.\n\nIn my Protocols, I will build into specific protocols things to look out for when you’ve been using the strategies for too long.\n\nSome things to be suspicious of:\n\nDoses of supplements that are much higher than my custom nutrient targets.\n\nDoses of supplements that are much higher than my custom nutrient targets.\n\nSuperfoods that provide certain nutrients at levels much higher than those targets.\n\nSuperfoods that provide certain nutrients at levels much higher than those targets.\n\nFoods that provide necessary nutrients but that you do not digest well.\n\nFoods that provide necessary nutrients but that you do not digest well.\n\nAny herbal medicines or pharmaceuticals.\n\nAny herbal medicines or pharmaceuticals.\n\nExercise regimes that have been too much for too long.\n\nExercise regimes that have been too much for too long.\n\nEven if you exit the optimization cycle to simply enjoy life, you should check back on a quarterly basis with your previous optimization targets, as long as you still value them, to see if you are staying optimized.\n\nFor example, you should not need to optimize your glucose every day, but if you are optimizing it you definitely should measure it every day until it is optimized. If you spent two months optimizing it and then exit the optimization cycle, you should, on a quarterly basis, take whatever number of measurements you previously found was needed to capture representative variability. If you had optimized it to 82 mg/dL, catching it at 95 mg/dL is better than letting a problem under the hood go on until you’re at 110 mg/dL.\n\nOr, perhaps you had optimized your strength on certain lifts and moved on to other physical feats. Check back with those lifts from time to time so you have a leading indicator of having lost your previous progress.\n\nYou may in the future reflect back on your optimizations and find that some of them were well worth it, and others were fleeting obsessions that you no longer see the value in. The more you reflect, the more you can whittle down the number of things you need to check in on.\n\nThe more you do this, the more you refine your conception of what is and isn’t worth optimizing, and the greater the return you get whenever you decide that it is worth taking another trip into the cycle of optimization.\n\nThe Next Step: Identify What You Want to Optimize\n\nStart with my top three tests to run for game-changing health results!\n\n3 Tests to Transform Your Health (and Your Lifespan)\n\nIf you are already doing What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health and there are still things you want to improve about your current health or that you want to optimize to protect your future health and longevity, it may be time to do some lab testing beyond whatever your doctor orders for you in your checkups.\n\nSubtitle: Use this approach whenever you aren't already getting the results you want.\n\nDescription: Scientific expertise blended with out-of-the-box thinking for new practical ideas you can use to help yourself on your journey to vibrant health, by Chris Masterjohn, PhD.",

    "content": "This is the Ultimate Guide to Optimize Anything.\n\nIf you are checking all the boxes in What Everyone Should Be Doing For Their Health, are not in the middle of an emergency, and not suffering from a debilitating disorder that makes it impossible to safely take responsibility for optimizing, then you should consider whether you are happy with your results. If not, and if simply trying more low-hanging fruit does not give you what you want, it is time to optimize.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThis is part of a series of protocols. See all of the protocols here:\n\nSee All Protocols\n\nOr, read it below.\n\nBy Chris Masterjohn, PhD, 2025.\n\nThis applies to anything in life, but the focus is on implementing this strategy for health using any type of health-promoting strategy, whether it be foods, supplements, exercise, biohacks, herbal compounds, or pharmaceuticals.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThis should be used as a framework for implementing any of my Protocols, and should be implemented after reading “How to Optimize Anything” to obtain proper context and detail and with examples to improve understanding.\n\nUse this decision-tree chart to decide whether optimization is the right strategy for you:\n\nDefine exactly what you want to optimize. Don’t rely on a proxy marker.\n\nIf what you are optimizing is not already in the form of a number, turn it into one by rating yourself on a scale of 1-5.\n\nPre-specify the exact definitions of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Hold yourself to these exact definitions throughout your optimization cycle.\n\nMake your definitions such that you expect your first month of rating, if your health would remain the same as it has been, you would expect to hit an average of 3, but you would see at least a few 2s and at least a few 4s, but would not expect to see any 1s or 5s unless your health got substantially better or worse.\n\nIt does not matter whether you make the scale 1= bad to 5= great or the reverse. Pick whatever makes the most sense to you for what you are rating.\n\nWhen you rate yourself, if you are unsure whether you should use one number or the one next to it, split the difference. For example, if you are unsure of whether you are a 3 or a 4, you are a 3.5.\n\nSpend as much time as you need to pre-specifying your definitions so that you never have to think much about it again. When you rate yourself, spend no more than one minute doing it. Making it as easy as possible makes it sustainable.\n\nTake your measurements every day. In general, you should ignore the individual daily measurements and focus on the averages.\n\nIf you question the validity of a data collection instrument you are using, perform a separate validation study according to the guidance of the manufacturer or according to whatever problem you believe needs to be addressed.\n\nBy contrast, never second-guess your data during the course of routine collection and measure it a second time just because you didn’t like or trust the first number. This introduces bias.\n\nYour entire regimen should be characterized in one or several accessible places in case you need to cross-reference or extract some of that background data.\n\nYour diet and supplements should be tracked in Cronometer.\n\nYour workout should be tracked in an app like Jefit or an adequate substitute.\n\nYou may have other data that is intermittent, such as annual or quarterly lab testing.\n\nAll of this constitutes “Background Data.”\n\nYou may want to extract one or two background data variables to your optimization sheet to help with interpretation. You should do this if you think it is an intermediary (mediating the causal pathway between your strategy and your target) or a confounder (independently impacting your target making it hard to judge the impact of your strategy) and if it is variable enough to have an effect and if the variability is not so repeatable that its impact easily averages out over a few weeks.\n\nThis could be one of the steps in any of my Protocols Series, or it could be something from ancestral traditions, something someone recommended, something that you found a scientific study supporting, or something you came up with yourself based on biochemical reasoning or intuition.\n\nDownload the Ultimate Optimization Spreadsheet here:\n\nDo not open it in Excel or any other desktop program. Immediately drag and drop it into Google Drive and double click to open it as a Google Sheet.\n\nOtherwise, features will be lost.\n\nSelf-rated variables are what you rate yourself on using a scale of 1-5.\n\nExtracted variables are things you extract from your Background Data.\n\nGlucose, ketones, and lactate are the key markers of energy metabolism you can measure at home, and you should measure your energy metabolism when you are in an optimization cycle because Energy Metabolism Governs Everything.\n\nThe sheet by default has three self-rated and two extracted variables alongside these three markers but you can use the sheet to track any eight variables without having to make complicated edits and the functionality will be preserved.\n\nMake the following edits:\n\nChange self-rated and extracted variable names to reflect the variables you are measuring.\n\nChange self-rated and extracted variable names to reflect the variables you are measuring.\n\nFor self-rated variables, replace each one’s name both in its data column as well as in its definition cell in the upper right, then fill in your succinct and precise definitions for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for each of them.\n\nFor self-rated variables, replace each one’s name both in its data column as well as in its definition cell in the upper right, then fill in your succinct and precise definitions for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for each of them.\n\nClick on the top chart.

It will now only require you to click once on the chart and then click once on “include hidden/filtered data” and keep doing this until you do it for the eighth and final chart.\n\nEnter “Baseline Data” into column A at the top. Collect baseline data for at least three days and ideally a week or more. The less familiar you are with how your variables of interest behave, the longer your baseline period should be.\n\nThis does not mean test “one vitamin” at a time or test “one exercise” at a time. It means test one strategy at a time. It could be a multivitamin, a B Complex, an entire training approach, a program a new coach gave you, or a radical change to your food groups. Whatever it is, decide exactly what it means and test this and this alone until you can make a conclusion.\n\nYour dose range should be derived from my Protocols or from the existing knowledge base. If you are testing a vitamin or mineral with a well characterized requirement, use the dietary reference intakes (such as the RDA or AI) or my Custom Nutrient Targets as the lowest dose and make the rest of the range based on randomized controlled trials or associations between food-based nutrient intakes. If what you are testing is not of this nature, use randomized controlled trials, association studies, case series and case reports, and independent anecdotes.\n\nTitrate up your dose in the same increment as your starting dose.\n\nAssume that the “dose” of anything (exercise volume, frequency and duration of sauna, milligrams of a nutrient, grams of a macronutrient, etc) will have a curve associated with benefit and harm that looks like this:\n\nYou can divide up the main zones like this:\n\nYou want to be just shy of the point of diminishing returns:\n\nTo get there, titrate up slowly until you experience a smaller benefit than you had obtained from earlier dose increases, then pull back to the last dose that had given you a big benefit.\n\nIf you add a strategy or increase a dose and nothing happens after a week, you can start moving more quickly until you see an effect. If the first effect you see is positive, you are at the bottom of the primary benefit curve and should titrate up until you find diminishing returns. If the first effect you see is negative, you are at the edge of the loss of benefit or adverse effect range and you should cut the dose down until you find a dose that provides a benefit without an adverse effect. If you cannot find such a dose, discard the strategy.\n\nGive at least a week to see if an effect emerges.\n\nIf you see an effect, stay at any given dose until your variables of interest stabilize.\n\nYou know you have stabilized when the moving averages are all clustering together in a straight line, and the short-term data is not breaking out of this cluster indicating a new emerging trend.\n\nOnce you stabilize, you can move on to the next dose increment or to the next strategy.\n\nIf you initially think you see a benefit but over time it seems to wear off or act inconsistently, you may benefit from performing a randomized controlled trial on yourself.\n\nIf the effect you think may be there is definitely worth knowing about, characterize the time for which you would have to conduct the trial.\n\nAssess your observational data for the possible existence of a lead-in effect, which is the time for the benefit to onset or reach a stable point, and the possible existence of a washout requirement, which is the persistence of the benefit from some period after you stop the strategy.\n\nYour randomized periods will need to include the part you are measuring plus a buffer of lead-in and washout if you determine that lead-in and washout periods are necessary.\n\nPlan to randomize at least six pairs of trials, so that you have twelve total trial periods.\n\nThe old approach is your control, and the new approach you are testing against it is your intervention.\n\nYour primary endpoint is the thing you are optimizing.\n\nCalculate the average and standard deviation of your control and intervention period from your observational data.\n\nUse a sample size calculator to see how many pairs of trials you need to randomize. Whichever period had a greater standard deviation, enter its mean and standard deviation for group 1. Enter the other mean for group 2. Hit “generate.” The number per group in the result is the number of pairs you are going to randomize. If it seems impractically high, make a rule that you will analyze your data at the exact half-way point. If it is convincing you will stop. If you are unsure you will finish the trial.\n\nUse a coin flip or a random number generator set to a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2. Establish two orders you are testing: control then intervention, or intervention then control. Assign each order to heads or tails, or to 1 or 2. Make a rule that all orders have to be used more than once. Use the coin flip or the generator until one of the orders has already been used for half the slots, then fill in the remainder with the opposite order so that they all get used the same number of times.\n\nNote in your sheet the occurrence of the trial and which day belongs to which order, but make a separate sheet or tab where you organize everything by the trial design.\n\nRun stats with Graphpad t-test calculator set to “enter or paste up to 2000 rows.” If your pairs were subject to a variable in a way that makes each pair more closely related than the non-paired trial periods (such as being conducted across a menstrual cycle or a period of linearly increasing vitamin D status), you can use a paired test, but you have to enter your data in the exact paired form. For example, if you randomized pairs of ten-day periods, you have to enter the average for each 10-day period rather than the daily data, and each member of a pair has to be in the same slot in each column so the pairs are side by side. If pairing is not indicated, you can enter your daily data and do not need to worry about the organization so much.\n\nIt will give you a two-tailed p value. If you had a very specific hypothesis of the data going one way and not the other such that you would be willing to forego the knowledge that it had truly gone in the opposite direction, you can cut this p value in half to arrive at a one-tailed p value. The p value is the likelihood that you would observe a difference of this value or greater had no real effect been present. Conventionally, less than 0.05 is significant, but this is arbitrary. This gives you a sense of how confident you can be that your effect is real. You are only trying to prove it to yourself so you can be somewhat liberal with your interpretation of the data.\n\nYou can also use the t-test calculator to test differences in your protocols.\n\nUltimately you want to look for whether the size of the effect is worth whatever cost is associated with obtaining it, and if you are convinced, incorporate the strategy into your long-term protocol and move on.\n\nYou are done optimizing when you get the results you want or you are out of strategies.\n\nIf you have the results you want, pick a new optimization target, or exit the optimization cycle until you feel the need to enter it again.\n\nIf you are out of strategies, take a “deload” period from optimizing, then focusing on learning until you have found new things to try.\n\nWhen you have optimized something, continue to track it or at least check in with it from time to time to keep it optimized. If you think something that worked before is now causing a problem, or is not necessary, use this optimization strategy to slim down your regimen. Intersperse periods of reflection on what you want to stay optimized so your optimization stays high-return.\n\nSubtitle: My 8-page quick guide that can be used to pair with any protocol to guarantee you get the results you are looking for.\n\nDescription: My 8-page quick guide that can be used to pair with any protocol to guarantee you get the results you are looking for.",

    "content": "There are basic things we should all be doing for good health.\n\nYou may be struggling to improve a problem and making little progress.\n\nOr, you may be giving up and taking a pharmaceutical shortcut that will later come back to bite you.\n\nOr, you may be missing the forrest for the trees in search of optimizing niche things that hardly matter when you haven’t yet mastered the basics.\n\nOr maybe you’re here because you simply want to cover all your bases and suspect you may be missing one or more.\n\nRegardless of which category you fit in, we should all from time to time review our health routine and make sure we’re covering all the basics.\n\nThese are the things we should all be doing for our health as a baseline, not things we should be measuring or things we should be optimizing. If your measurements are coming in looking bad or you’re trying to optimize something that just won’t optimize, come back to this and see if you’re hitting all the basic action items.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nHere’s your simple checklist. Make sure you read the detailed description below before deciding whether you can check off each item.\n\n☐ Eat a nutritious, largely whole-food diet that is digested well and adequate in all the macronutrients and micronutrients. Limit alcohol to no more than 15 drinks per month.\n\n☐ Get plenty of direct outdoor sunshine in the morning, a little bit in the afternoon, spend most of your day in natural lighting, and avoid artificial light at night.\n\n☐ Maintain a healthy body composition.\n\n☐ Breath through your nose and breathe fully.\n\n☐ Live an active lifestyle with healthy movement patterns.\n\n☐ Take a food-first, pharma-last approach.\n\n☐ Get yearly checkups from your primary care doctor, dentist, and a movement specialist. Women should stay up to date with gynecologists and most people should add hearing and vision screening as they get older, or at any point if they have reason to believe their hearing and vision is suffering.\n\n☐ Treat your eyes and ears well.\n\n☐ Work in healthy positions.\n\n☐ Be a digital intentionalist, and spend time in the real world.\n\n☐ Be clean, from both industrial and microbial toxins.\n\n☐ Nourish positive relationships with our family and friends and a positive outlook within ourselves.\n\n☐ Take bites of life only as big as you can chew, but always be taking bites.\n\nEat a nutritious, largely whole-food diet that is adequate in all the macronutrients and micronutrients.\n\nWhat follows is not a list of foods that everyone must eat, but rather how everyone should eat if they want to meet their nutrient needs without thinking any harder or further about it.\n\nYour diet should contain protein diversified across meat, fish, shellfish, and other invertebrates, such as insects if you eat them, eggs, and dairy products. Most of these foods should take up a third of your plate at each meal when used as your main source of protein, but eggs should take up about half your plate when used as your main source of protein. When eating eggs, the white should always be fully cooked solid. When using liquid dairy products as your main source of protein, you need at least two glasses worth at a given meal.\n\nIf you eat animals other than shellfish, try to eat nose-to-tail. At a minimum, try to include liver and edible bones or bone broth.\n\nIf you don’t eat animals, put special emphasis on legumes (lentils, peas, and beans) that you digest well. These need to make up the bulk of your calories to provide enough protein.\n\nAfter you meet your protein requirement, you can flexibly decide whether you feel better with the remainder of your diet being fueled by carbohydrate, fat, or a mix of the two.\n\nLimit your total number of alcoholic drinks to more than 15 per month, and, if you do drink alcohol, group the drinks in a way that interferes least with your sleep and quality of life.\n\nTo ensure you are getting adequate vitamins and minerals from food, follow these principles:\n\nEat an average of one to two ounces of liver per day (you can batch this once per week).\n\nEat an average of one to two ounces of liver per day (you can batch this once per week).\n\nEat an average of one or two oysters per day (you need this every day unless you also get your protein for the day primarily as red meat or cheese).\n\nEat an average of one or two oysters per day (you need this every day unless you also get your protein for the day primarily as red meat or cheese).\n\nUse a tablespoon or two per day of unfortified nutritional yeast in anything that could use a cheesy flavor.\n\nUse a tablespoon or two per day of unfortified nutritional yeast in anything that could use a cheesy flavor.\n\nDiversify your carbohydrates among whole grains, legumes (lentils, peas, and beans), starchy tubers such as potatoes, and whole fruits. If you’re going to cut one of those out, you can cut out whole grains. Grains and legumes (alongside nuts and seeds) should be soaked, sprouted, soured, or fermented.\n\nDiversify your carbohydrates among whole grains, legumes (lentils, peas, and beans), starchy tubers such as potatoes, and whole fruits. If you’re going to cut one of those out, you can cut out whole grains. Grains and legumes (alongside nuts and seeds) should be soaked, sprouted, soured, or fermented.\n\nEat several cups per day of vegetables, diversified across the color spectrum. Make sure at least one of those cups of vegetables is dark green.\n\nEat several cups per day of vegetables, diversified across the color spectrum. Make sure at least one of those cups of vegetables is dark green.\n\nAt least a cup of fruits and vegetables should be raw to maximally preserve vitamin C. The most popular sources of vitamin C-rich foods that could fulfill this purpose are bell peppers, strawberries, oranges, pineapple, papaya, and lemon.\n\nAt least a cup of fruits and vegetables should be raw to maximally preserve vitamin C. The most popular sources of vitamin C-rich foods that could fulfill this purpose are bell peppers, strawberries, oranges, pineapple, papaya, and lemon.\n\nYou need three servings of calcium-rich-foods per day. These can include dairy products like milk, yogurt, kefir, or cheese, but not dairy products that isolate the fat (butter, cream) or the protein (whey protein, casein). They can include edible bones, such as those in canned fish or the soft parts on the ends of chicken bones, or whole bone meal powder. They can include some greens, mainly napa cabbage, Chinese mustard greens, and bok choy.\n\nYou need three servings of calcium-rich-foods per day.

They can include some greens, mainly napa cabbage, Chinese mustard greens, and bok choy.\n\nInclude foods or supplements that aid in digestion at every meal. Examples include ginger, lacto-fermented vegetables, kombucha, raw apple cider vinegar, and Swedish bitters.\n\nInclude foods or supplements that aid in digestion at every meal. Examples include ginger, lacto-fermented vegetables, kombucha, raw apple cider vinegar, and Swedish bitters.\n\nSalt your food to taste. Assume you are not getting enough salt unless you do, especially if you are not eating bread and cheese.\n\nSalt your food to taste. Assume you are not getting enough salt unless you do, especially if you are not eating bread and cheese.\n\nIf you are not hitting one or more of these, you should take a multivitamin. I have given guidance on multivitamins in Will Multivitamins Help You Live Longer?\n\nEat at least eighty percent of your food cooked at home. If you cook with oil, use traditional fats and oils like red palm oil, coconut oil, olive oil, or fats from grass-fed animals (butter, ghee, tallow, lard), not “seed oils.” When you eat out use restaurants that are confirmed to not use seed oils. Across the board, minimize deep fried foods and desserts as special treats.\n\nSelect your foods based on what produces stool quality consistent with 3-5 on the Bristol chart most of the time. Your bowel movements should not require excessive strain nor come with excessive urgency. You should at least be in the range of having two to twenty bowel movements per week, but should ideally have one to two per day.\n\nEat your food sitting down in a relaxed environment, chew it thoroughly without rushing, go for a light walk after eating or at least stay upright for 40 minutes, and avoid laying down within two to three hours of eating.\n\nGet plenty of direct outdoor sunshine in the morning, a little bit in the afternoon, spend most of your day in natural lighting, and avoid artificial blue light at night.\n\nEvery morning, get 30 minutes of outdoor unprotected sunshine. Get it as early as possible after you wake up. Try to ditch your glasses if you wear them. Even if it is overcast, go outside. Even if it is raining, try to go outside under shelter.\n\nIn the afternoon, usually around 1 PM, the UV light is the strongest. Get at least two minutes of unprotected sunshine during this time to maximize the synthesis of vitamin D. This dose should be less than what is required to even temporarily turn your skin a little pink. However, the darker your skin is the more time you need. For example, very dark skin can require up to two hours to maximize vitamin D synthesis.\n\nOutside of this small afternoon dose, you should protect your skin from the sun using clothing made from natural fibers for most of the day, especially from 10 AM to 5 PM. For example, wear a sun hat when in the sun.\n\nNevertheless, you should spend as much of your day in natural indirect sunlight as possible. Ideally this is outdoors, where overhead shade protects your skin from excess UV rays but outdoor sunlight is still what is enabling you to see everything around you.\n\nIf you must work indoors, to the extent possible, work in an environment that has abundant natural light coming in the windows so that you can see everything you need to see without using any artificial lights. Avoid tinted windows and “environmentally friendly” low-emissivity windows. “Environmentally friendly” windows hate your mitochondria and block the infrared light needed to nourish them.\n\nPreferably after the sun sets, but at least for two hours before bed, avoid any artificial blue light. You can switch your ambient lighting over to red or amber lights and you can wear amber-colored blue-blocking glasses if you have to expose yourself to standard lights (like the refrigerator light or if you have rooms like the bathroom where you don’t switch over the ambient lighting).\n\nMaintain a healthy body composition.\n\nIf you spend a lot of time among general populations in the west, a good rule of thumb is that you want to be in the upper half of muscle mass and in the bottom 20-40% of fat mass.\n\nIf you plug your height and weight into a BMI calculator, it should be at least 18.5. It should be below 25 if you are white, 24 if you are black, and 23 if you are east or south Asian, with some studies arguing for a very tight 18.5-19.2 optimal for south Asians.\n\nIf you look like you carry a “beer gut” when you look in the mirror, you have too much visceral abdominal fat and need to lose fat. It is healthier and less risky to carry “rolls,” and for women it is healthy to carry fat in the hips and thighs.\n\nIf you measure your body fat mass and percentage with DEXA, underwater weighing, or bod pod, the percentage for men should be 12-17% and for women should be at least 17%, ideally above 22%, and up to 30%. If you convert your height to square meters (from inches, square your height in inches and multiply by 703) and divide your total fat mass by this number, you can derive your fat mass index. It should be at least 4 but under 10. You can then plug your height, weight, and body fat percentage into a fat-free mass index calculator. Your fat-free mass should be at least 20. If you care more about longevity than aesthetics you should not push it higher than 24.\n\nBreath through your nose and breathe fully.\n\nBy default, your breathing should occur through your nose.\n\nThere are exceptions, with the primary two being when you are unable to breathe through your nose and when your oxygen demand from exercise exceeds what you are able to get through nose breathing.\n\nWhen you inhale, your default should be to fill your entire torso with breath, allowing your ribs and diaphragm to expand in all three dimensions, without letting your belly hang out and while keeping your shoulders relaxed.\n\nBy default, you should take long, full inhales and exhales that last around 6.5 seconds each.\n\nYou don’t want to be thinking about your breath all the time, but you can occasionally check in with how it’s behaving and set apart small amounts of time each day to practice proper breathing if needed.\n\nLive an active lifestyle with healthy movement patterns.\n\nYou should have an active lifestyle that incorporates all of the essential movement patterns and challenges to your system.\n\nYou do not need to track your workouts or optimize for specific skills, but your movement regime needs to fulfill all the challenges necessary to keep your body working properly, because everything in your body follows a “use it or lose it” principle.\n\nThus, if you simply want to maintain a series of sports games for fun, this is fine, but review them to make sure that all of the following get challenged. Fill in any gaps you discover.\n\nIt is definitely possible to find creative ways to hit more than one of each item in a single exercise, but if you aren’t a trainer or a biomechanics expert you should seek one out if trying to design the most efficient program you can.\n\nEvery ten days, your exercise should include the following types of cardio sessions:\n\nAt least one intense 30-second sprint using any type of exercise that leaves you huffing and puffing afterward.\n\nAt least one intense 30-second sprint using any type of exercise that leaves you huffing and puffing afterward.\n\nOne cardio session where you sustain one pace for an hour that you probably couldn’t have held for another 10-15 minutes without slowing down or giving up.\n\nOne cardio session where you sustain one pace for an hour that you probably couldn’t have held for another 10-15 minutes without slowing down or giving up.\n\nOne cardio session where you hit a mix of different intensities (a sports game or group workout class could fit).\n\nOne cardio session where you hit a mix of different intensities (a sports game or group workout class could fit).\n\nEvery week, you should hit at least one heavy working set of resistance exercise for each of the following domains:\n\nUpper body vertical pull (e.g. pullup).\n\nUpper body vertical pull (e.g. pullup).\n\nUpper body vertical push (e.g. overhead press).\n\nUpper body vertical push (e.g. overhead press).\n\nUpper body horizontal pull (e.g. row).\n\nUpper body horizontal pull (e.g. row).\n\nUpper body horizontal push (e.g. pushup).\n\nUpper body horizontal push (e.g. pushup).\n\nLower body pull (e.g. deadlift).\n\nLower body pull (e.g. deadlift).\n\nLower body push (e.g. squat).\n\nLower body push (e.g. squat).\n\nHorizontal rotation (e.g. banded or cable trunk rotation).\n\nHorizontal rotation (e.g. banded or cable trunk rotation).\n\nDiagonal rotation (e.g. regular and reverse chop and lifts).\n\nDiagonal rotation (e.g. regular and reverse chop and lifts).\n\nSide bending at the torso (e.g. side plank, dumbell side bends, or a kettlebell windmill).\n\nSide bending at the torso (e.g. side plank, dumbell side bends, or a kettlebell windmill).\n\nAbduction and adduction of the hip (e.g. standing banded or cable abduction and adduction).\n\nAbduction and adduction of the hip (e.g. standing banded or cable abduction and adduction).\n\nInternal and external rotation of the shoulder (e.g. banded or cable internal and external rotation).\n\nInternal and external rotation of the shoulder (e.g. banded or cable internal and external rotation).\n\nExternal and internal hip rotation (e.g. clamshells and reverse clamshells).\n\nExternal and internal hip rotation (e.g. clamshells and reverse clamshells).\n\nThe six directions of the neck (bending up and down, rotating to each side, and side-bending to each side).\n\nThe six directions of the neck (bending up and down, rotating to each side, and side-bending to each side).\n\nIf this seems too complicated, you might want to look for a group workout class that naturally hits many of the bases you tend to miss when you design your own workouts. For example, a pilates class will often hit almost all of the strength points listed above. A Lagree class will mix this with sustained or mixed cardio intensity for an hour.\n\nThe resistance exercise sets only “count” if you are within 80% of what you could have done before being unable to do any further work. For example, if you hit eight reps and could have gotten 10, it counts. But if you hit eight reps and you could have gotten 12, it was a warmup and doesn’t count toward the minimum of one set per week. To estimate this properly, you should have experienced at least several times in your life a rep where you hit a wall where you spent five to eight seconds pushing with all your might through the failure point in order to complete it. If you haven’t, you are probably underestimating your capacity.\n\nMake sure that at least every 7-10 days elements of your exercise challenge your balance, your ability to quickly change directions, your ability to be quick on your feet, and your ability to respond to unexpected stimuli outside your control (such as having to catch a ball that someone else throws).\n\nGet as much light movement in as possible (for example, comfortable walking), aiming for at least one if not several hours per day.\n\nIf you track your workouts, you should not be losing strength, endurance, speed, balance, or agility over time. If you are, it could be a sign that something else is wrong, but the most obvious place to look is that you are training too much. Try reducing your exercise volume, duration, frequency, or intensity, or choose easier exercises, and see if it helps.\n\nIf you don’t track your workouts, make sure that they are not leaving you tired all the time. If they are, it could be a sign that something else is wrong, but the most obvious place to look is that you are training too much. Try reducing your exercise volume, duration, frequency, or intensity, or choose easier exercises, and see if it helps.\n\nYou should not be experiencing joint pain and it should certainly not be getting worse over time. If you are, you may simply be moving wrong, or you may simply have put together a poor selection of exercises to create an imbalanced program. Have a trainer or your movement specialist (see below) review your movement quality and program design to look for flaws that could be causing joint pain. You also need to look at how you are distributing the load of your workouts. Make sure that the hurting joint is getting a long enough multi-day rest period before it gets worked hard again. Don’t use anabolic steroids, which make your muscles too strong for your joints. Don’t do the same exercise all the time while constantly pushing it to the highest load possible, which is joint suicide.\n\nYou shouldn’t be getting injured, whether acutely or chronically. If you are, have a trainer or your movement specialist (see below) thoroughly review and revise your practice to focus on injury prevention.\n\nOn the other hand, if your joints hurt and you aren’t exercising, you need to start exercising for joint health. If you are falling and injuring yourself and don’t exercise, you need to start exercising for balance, strength, and to train safe ways of falling.\n\nEvery once in a while, try a new sport or group activity. If you notice you are bad at something, or are losing the ability to do it, and it is important to you, find a way to add it to your training regimen.\n\nIf hitting all the bases above exceeds your total capacity for exercise, reduce the frequency of the exercises or the number of components you are hitting until you find something sustainable. First try doing them less often, such as every two weeks instead of every one week. If you find that this is not frequent enough for you to get better at anything, then cut down the number of exercises and focus on doing at least one thing frequently enough to keep getting better at it. Try to train your way into handling a well-rounded regime that does hit all the bases.\n\nYour movement patterns should be checked at least yearly by a specialist (see below). Whatever you learn about healthy movement patterns from your specialist should be incorporated into your training program to improve the quality of your movement.\n\nAllow yourself at least a nine-hour window to sleep. Prioritize it above anything else you might do at night and be consistent about it every day. Start this sleeping window at the same time every day.\n\nFrame this in a period of mental relaxation and zero exposure to artificial blue light. This winding down period should be two to four hours long.\n\nIf you notice patterns in how eating impacts your sleep — for example, if going to bed hungry or going to bed after eating a big meal hurts your sleep — eat in the way that maximizes the quantity and quality of your sleep, with the primary endpoint being that you wake up feeling rested and ready to tackle the new day.\n\nDo not set an alarm clock. To the extent possible, schedule your day so that you have room to wake up a little later than usual and you will not be late for anything important. If you have to use an alarm clock as a safety measure, schedule your day so that you can set the alarm two hours after you expect to wake up and you will still have time to get ready for anything important even in the event you wake up to the alarm.\n\nTake a food-first, pharma-last approach.\n\nYou should always try to meet your nutrient requirements from food before you try to meet them with supplements.\n\nWhen you use supplements, you should use the least number of supplements at the lowest doses needed to achieve your purpose.\n\nIf you can solve a problem with foods and supplements you should always do so before you try to solve it with pharmaceuticals.\n\nNone of this is meant to say that there is no place for supplements — even at megadose levels — or drugs. However, you should maintain a bias to solve problems with foods and natural remedies first, with supplements second, and with pharmaceuticals last, and should be very conservative about the need to progress from one type of solution to the next.\n\nGet yearly checkups from your primary care doctor, dentist, and a movement specialist.\n\nThe doctor and dentist are largely self-explanatory: you want to know if you are developing a problem and address it in a timely manner.\n\nInflammation in your oral cavity can be a systemic source of inflammation, so the dentist is not merely an aesthetic appointment.\n\nIdeally your doctor follows your food-first, pharma-last approach.\n\nIdeally your dentist is familiar with Weston Price and Sir Edward Mellanby’s research showing that good nutrition can lead to refilling of cavities without surgery, and errs on the side of putting the least number of foreign objects in your mouth possible using the least toxic materials available, and does not believe root canals are safe. Often searching for a “biological dentist” can help turn that up.\n\nYou need someone to assess your joint alignments and movement patterns to make sure your activity regime reinforces good movement patterns that will lead to a pain-free life from now into your old age. Try seeking someone associated with the Postural Restoration Institute, the Institute of Physical Art, or the Ida Rolf Institute.\n\nTreat your eyes and ears well.\n\nUse maximal ear protection when you are exposed to unnaturally loud, repeatable noises. For example, at the gun range or concerts.\n\nAvoid putting sound inside your ears whenever you can. For example, listen to a podcast with external speakers and put phone calls on speaker when you can get away with it socially.\n\nIf you read regularly, take frequent breaks to look at things that are far away. You could set a timer every 20 minutes as a reminder to spend one minute looking at things in the distance, or you could use a task-based reminder to avoid interruptions, such as finishing a section or chapter of what you are reading.\n\nIf you do regular reading on your phone or computer, you need to address not only distance, but also screen exposure. Aim to do as much of your reading on physical paper in natural lighting as possible. One way to negotiate this would be to read online when you know you have to frequently flip between many sources, but to print something out and read it when you know you are going to read a document from beginning to end.\n\nWork in healthy positions.\n\nIf you work on a computer, you need to minimize the crowding together of your head, your hands, and everything in between in space. Have your primary setup keep your monitor at eye level and your hands resting on an external keyboard at slightly below elbow level when your shoulders are in a relaxed and retracted position. Have the distances set while you maintain a neutral spine with your ribs stacked over your hips and your head centered over your torso, not sliding forward or looking downward. Your keyboard should be designed to allow you to separate your hands and rotate them to a less flat position, like the Kinesis 2.\n\nIf you are able to maintain this setup, it will help minimize the stress of a disorganized posture on your upper body, but your upper body still won’t get enough movement in this position, so you will need to take frequent breaks to get your upper body moving.\n\nIf you are staring at a screen for hours, you will also need to give breaks to your eyes to look at things that are far away. You may therefore want to take breaks every twenty minutes or after certain types of tasks are complete to get in “movement snacks” that include head and torso rotation as well as external rotation of your shoulders and elbows and supination of your wrists, while also getting some “eye snacks” in by looking at objects in the distance.\n\nEven while doing computer work, however, you can find many healthier positions with your lower body to alternate. For example, if you have an adjustable standing desk with a treadmill, you can alternate between standing, walking, sitting, lunging, squatting, kneeling, sitting on your shins, sitting cross-legged or in a half lotus or lotus, and sitting in a 90-90 while you work.\n\nIf you need to use a laptop without an external keyboard because, for example, you frequently work at coffee shops or while traveling, you should take more frequent breaks for full-body exercises to break up the monotony of a poor working position.\n\nIf you do a different type of physical work where these ideas don’t apply, get input from a movement specialist on how you can best position yourself for your work.\n\nIf you do stationary work, you will need to find ways to work in movement snacks. If you do physical labor, you will need to find ways to mitigate overuse injuries from doing one type of movement over and over, or from using one side of your body so much more than the other.\n\nBe a digital intentionalist, and spend time in the real world.\n\nA digital minimalist tries to minimize their connection to the digital world.\n\nA digital intentionalist thinks, “is this connection to the digital world useful to me?” and adopts the digital custom only when the answer is clearly yes.\n\nOur bodies and minds are designed for the physical world, not the digital world.\n\nIf we spend lots of time on the computer or phone, it puts us into a stressed state. If we “forrest bathe,” it reduces stress.\n\nOur social media feeds are designed to addict us with dopamine hits that facilitate doom scrolling.\n\nNo one goes out to a 3-hour group dinner and laments having “doom dinnerred.”\n\nIn general, then, we want to opt for the “real world” over the digital world at least as a preference, opting for the digital world only when we intentionally choose it because we see a specific benefit to it.\n\nWhile we have a long way to go in understanding the impacts of electromagnetic frequency (EMF) on health, the principle that is emerging from the research is that we want a high exposure to the native EMF generated by people, animals, the earth, and by the sun as experienced from earth when following the light exposure guidelines described earlier. On the other hand, we want a low exposure to non-native EMF from electrical devices.\n\nIt may be that grounding is an important aspect of being connected to the real world, alongside attending social events with real people and spending time in nature. This means being barefoot or wearing shoes made from leather you sweat in or made from modern “grounding” materials while being connected either to the earth itself or to a conductive material like the salt water of the ocean or unsealed concrete.\n\nAt a minimum, for EMF:\n\nPut at least 8-12 inches of distance between yourself and your phone or your laptop, unless you have an EMF-blocking pad in the way. Even then, maintain whatever distance you can, such as having your laptop on an EMF-blocking pad on top of a pillow instead of on your lap if you are working while reclining on a couch.\n\nPut at least 8-12 inches of distance between yourself and your phone or your laptop, unless you have an EMF-blocking pad in the way. Even then, maintain whatever distance you can, such as having your laptop on an EMF-blocking pad on top of a pillow instead of on your lap if you are working while reclining on a couch.\n\nTurn your wifi off when you sleep.\n\nTurn your wifi off when you sleep.\n\nTurn off and unplug devices you are close to when you aren’t using them.\n\nTurn off and unplug devices you are close to when you aren’t using them.\n\nWhenever practical, charge your devices in between using them rather than while using them.\n\nWhenever practical, charge your devices in between using them rather than while using them.\n\nAt a minimum, for the real world:\n\nSpend some time in nature at least once a week, even if it’s just a walk on the beach or through the woods.\n\nSpend some time in nature at least once a week, even if it’s just a walk on the beach or through the woods.\n\nEat dinner with family or friends at least once a week, or do something else with genuine social value.\n\nEat dinner with family or friends at least once a week, or do something else with genuine social value.\n\nOther good ideas in this area are to try grounding, have your home evaluated for dirty electricity, choose areas to live that are less dense with power lines and 5g antennas, practice “phone fasts,” and anything else you think of to anchor you more in the real world than the digital world.\n\nAn important part of connecting to the real world is being barefoot. Being barefoot on the earth can be a way to practice grounding, but another important part of going barefoot is that you get far more neurological stimulation to your feet when they have to adjust to hard surfaces without shoes in the way. This trains your proprioception, which is your sense of how you are positioned within three-dimensional space. Robust proprioception is extremely important to injury prevention. Cleanliness concerns about this are covered in the section below.\n\nAnother important part of connecting to the real world is your exteroception. Whereas proprioception is your sense of yourself and your position with respect to your environment, exteroception is your perception of the environment itself through your five senses. The recommendation in the exercise section to make sure your exercise regimen trains “your ability to respond to unexpected stimuli outside your control (such as having to catch a ball that someone else throws)” will help train your exteroception. Using a sport that requires traversing an area while navigating around obstacles or making decisions of where to go based on things you observe — for example, hiking, skiing, snowboarding, an obstacle course, and many others — will help train your exteroception. Ditching your GPS and going for a ride can train it. If you are always “in your head” you should consider training it with something like my Walking Sensory Meditation.\n\nBe clean, from both industrial and microbial toxins.\n\nBeing clean by washing your hands, taking showers, keeping your house in order, throwing old food out of your fridge, cleaning the remains of food waste from your eating environment, and cleaning the kitchen and taking out the trash is important to prevent overgrowth of pathogenic microbes on your skin, mucous membranes, and in your home. The reason pathogenic microbes are pathogenic is because they produce toxins.\n\nWe therefore want to consider water—>soap—>antimicrobial cleaners similarly to foods—>supplements/herbs—>drugs.\n\nYou may be surprised what can be cleaned with water and a cloth alone.\n\nA soap with no fragrances or other additional ingredients is not toxic at all, though it does have the downside of dissolving the lipids of your skin. It is obvious you need soap to clean dishes because the soap dissolves the greasy elements in water just like it dissolves your skin lipids into the water. Soap is also more effective at washing pathogenic microbes off your skin, so you should use it after your hands get dirty or after you go to the bathroom and before you eat. In fact, you almost never need to kill pathogenic microbes on your hands (with obvious exceptions like surgery prep or after coming into contact with something egregiously pathogenic) because they haven’t colonized your skin and soap is incredibly effective at washing them right off into the drain.\n\nHowever, it still makes sense to minimize unnecessary contact with soap. For example, if you are washing dishes by hand for a whole house all day, wearing dish gloves will be a great way to protect your hands from too much soap (as well as too much water).\n\nRarely do you actually need antimicrobial killers. When something kills a microbe it will inevitably have at least a little toxicity to us, so you should be judicious about using them, because the entire point of being clean from pathogenic microbes is to be clean from their toxins.\n\nStagnant environments breed microbial overgrowth. You want your digestive motility to be fast enough to prevent overgrowth of bacteria and fungi in your small intestine. You want light to enter your home and any water to be dried rather than to sit stagnant so you don’t get overgrowth of toxic mold. If your room is a mess, there is probably something funky growing underneath something you haven’t picked up over the last year that comes bearing gifts of toxins.\n\nBy the same token we don’t want industrial toxins bombarding us from all the entry points into our living space, so filter your drinking water, your shower water, and your air.\n\nSynthetic clothing does contain toxins, but how often they leach into your skin probably depends on how much you sweat in them. On the other hand, working up a sweat in a material that has no sweat-wicking properties can get fungal toxins being produced in your skin quite quickly. So make choices to minimize unnecessary synthetic fibers, but be aware that industrial toxins and fungal toxins are equally problematic. Make the choice that minimizes total toxin exposure. If you wind up with an itchy rash after your workout, you haven’t done that.\n\nYou have to consider that a microbial infection leads to self-reproduction of the toxin factory within your skin, whereas synthetic fibers can only leach toxins from the clothing to the surface of your skin acutely and you may be able to wash much of them off the surface before absorption. Therefore, it is more important to wear whatever material will prevent you from getting an ugly rash after you workout than it is to avoid synthetic fibers, but once you have this part under control, you should still err on the side of natural fibers.\n\nTry to use glass, stainless steel, and ceramic over plastic for your cooking and the storage of your food and drink. Cast iron is good for cooking if you don’t have an iron overload problem.\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed the benefit of going barefoot for grounding and proprioception. If you do this for grounding, you do want to consider the quality of the ground you are on. You can avoid the risk of soil parasites by avoiding land with fecal matter from wild animals, pets, and application of unheated manure. You should definitely wash your feet before entering your home. A convenient way to do this is to carry water-based disposable wipes to clean your feet as you switch back into your shoes. However, if you suspect you have been exposed to fecal matter you should wash thoroughly with soap and water as fast as possible.\n\nWhile you cannot ground on the floors of your home, you can certainly develop proprioception by walking barefoot inside your home. If you do this, you certainly want your floors to be clean, which means you should follow the Asian practice of no shoes in the house, and dedicated slippers for special dirty areas. For example, special slippers for the bathroom, and, if you have one, the balcony, while having dedicated areas for bare feet. In the Asian practice this might be limited to tatami flooring, but if your goal is to develop better proprioception, this could be all the flat floors of your house. Just wash them off with water before you get into bed or otherwise put your feet places that will rub against your face, since no matter how clean your floor is you would never eat off it.\n\nThe best way to negotiate these concerns is to use grounding shoes for grounding, use Asian traditions to keep your home floors pristine, walk barefoot on your pristine home floors, and wipe your feet with water wipes before bed.\n\nNourish positive relationships with your family and friends and maintain a positive outlook.\n\nHumans are social animals. Every introvert needs to socialize and every extrovert needs to introspect. Make sure you make time for both. Seek friends who bring out the best in you.\n\nHealth requires a disposition toward hope, optimism, and gratitude. Experiment with whatever helps you maintain this disposition and keep what works. Prayer, meditation, and gratitude journaling are some things you could try.\n\nHave a strong sense of purpose, but do something trivial.\n\nWe can see the importance of purpose and calling to longevity in the famous story of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both dying on the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1826. The last words of Adams were “Thomas Jefferson survives,” though Jefferson had in fact died several hours earlier.\n\nI also saw this when my grandmother died. About a week earlier, she told me she was depressed because she didn’t understand why she was still on earth when my grandfather had left her several years earlier, but that she felt the family needed her. Her sense of purpose was conflicted so she was left in a state of limbo. While she got sick and fell in the days that followed, she passed from this life after internally reconciling herself that her purpose on this earth had been completed and it was time to meet her husband and Lord in heaven.\n\nIf a strong sense of purpose can determine whether we defeat or submit to death, it certainly must be a central driver of health.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to be able to do something trivial. Something strictly for enjoyment.\n\nMany of us are so obsessed with the purpose of everything that we cannot do something that we have no answer for when asked “what is the purpose of this?”\n\nFor example, having a hobby is great, but if you are constantly trying to optimize it and improve your performance, you aren’t genuinely resting in the pure enjoyment of it. Find something that you do for fun and only for fun. You don’t even need to call it “fun.” Just something whose purpose is nothing other than the experience. Even if that is simply resting.\n\nTake bites of life only as big as you can chew, but always be taking bites.\n\nOur comfort zone is where we go to shrivel and die.\n\nOutside the outer atmosphere of our comfort zone is where we go to give up.\n\nJust outside our comfort zone is where we go to grow.\n\nWhat we want to do is exit our comfort zone just far enough to obtain a growth stimulus, then come back to our comfort zone to rest and recover. Then rinse and repeat.\n\nWe can apply this to exercise, cold plunging, sauna, intermittent hypobaric hypoxia training, learning a language, mastering a new discipline, learning a new hobby, or any other type of growth.\n\nTo some extent, these will occupy specific stress buckets, and to some extent we have a total stress bucket.\n\nIf you aren’t growing, you probably aren’t taking off a big enough bite.\n\nIf you keep getting worse at something the more you bite, your bites are too big.\n\nAlways make sure you are challenged and always make sure you are properly resting and recovering from the challenge. This balance is what sets us on the path to always learn and grow.\n\nChecked All the Boxes?\n\nIf you checked all the boxes, great! You’re doing all the basics right.\n\nIf you feel like you’re on top of the world with your health, rest on your laurels a bit.\n\nBut if there are still problems to solve or goals to reach, consider entering an Optimization Cycle.\n\nLearn more about that in the next article:\n\nHow to Optimize Anything (Scientifically Proven)\n\nNot everyone has to optimize.\n\nSubtitle: Make sure you're keeping up with the basics.\n\nDescription: Make sure you're keeping up with the basics.",

    "title": "What to Do About SSRI Withdrawal Mitochondrial Dysfunction",
    "content": "So far in this series we have seen the following:\n\nThat Prozac is a performance-enhancing drug but inferior to exercise as an antidepressant\n\nThat Prozac is a performance-enhancing drug but inferior to exercise as an antidepressant\n\nThat serotonin is a whole-body signaling compound acting primarily outside the brain on cells that are not neurons to control the hypoxia response, which is fundamental to the regulation of energy metabolism\n\nThat serotonin is a whole-body signaling compound acting primarily outside the brain on cells that are not neurons to control the hypoxia response, which is fundamental to the regulation of energy metabolism\n\nThat SSRIs are primarily mitochondrial drugs rather than “psychiatric” drugs\n\nThat SSRIs are primarily mitochondrial drugs rather than “psychiatric” drugs\n\nThat protracted SSRI withdrawal is a form of mitochondrial dysfunction\n\nThat protracted SSRI withdrawal is a form of mitochondrial dysfunction\n\nThat SSRIs can act as mitochondrial poisons, despite their paradoxical ability to also stimulate positive mitochondrial functions\n\nThat SSRIs can act as mitochondrial poisons, despite their paradoxical ability to also stimulate positive mitochondrial functions\n\nAnd that hypobaric hypoxia training is 25 times more effective at promoting psychological resilience than pharmacological antidepressants.\n\nAnd that hypobaric hypoxia training is 25 times more effective at promoting psychological resilience than pharmacological antidepressants.\n\nThe latter finding is strongly suggestive that depression is a variation of “hypoxia intolerance.”\n\nMany people may not find this easy to grasp because “hypoxia” sounds like you must be getting strangled or drowning under water.\n\nBut the hypoxia response is always active to some degree in various places in the body as a central means of regulating energy metabolism in a completely healthy human. This is because you always have variation in how much oxygen is reaching various places in your body and what their demands for mitochondrial energy production are. Any relative mismatch between the supply and demand for oxygen will elicit some stimulation of the hypoxia response to restore equilibrium.\n\nWhile some of the effects of SSRI withdrawal are a return of the depression or anxiety that the SSRI was used to treat in the first place, and while some are a result of readjustments in neurotransmitters taking place, the protracted withdrawal that lasts months or years rather than a few weeks is clearly a form of mitochondrial dysfunction that is lasting so long due to the rising of vicious cycles that are locking in the dysfunctional state.\n\nIn this tenth and final article in the SSRI series, we brainstorm some things that could be tried to remedy this mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThe first and most robust defense against SSRI-associated mitochondrial dysfunction is to avoid going on SSRIs in the first place.\n\nThe second and next most powerful defense is to stay on SSRIs for as short a time as possible, and to limit the course to less than a year and, if possible, to a few months or even a few weeks. The likelihood of severe and protracted withdrawal increases dramatically with the time spent on the SSRI, and the difference between one year and eight years is likely enormous.\n\nThe third defense is to initiate a withdrawal that is as long and drawn-out as possible under the supervision of a very experienced physician.\n\nThere is an exception to this: if you’ve only been on an SSRI for less than eight weeks, you may be best off getting rid of it as fast as possible. This is because somewhere between one and eight weeks is the minimum length of time necessary to make withdrawal a problem. You don’t want a slow taper to turn you from someone who didn’t need to worry about tapering into someone who has now been on SSRIs for months and needs to worry about each dose-lowering event.\n\nThere is some support for using buproprion (Wellbutrin) and PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. Cialis or Viagra) for SSRI-related sexual dysfunction, which may generalize to post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD). Titrating up Terra Soul Gelatinized Maca from ¼ teaspoon to 3 tablespoons per day could boost dopamine and norepinephrine and act as a more natural form of buproprion. Titrating up citrulline from 2 grams to 10 grams per day could boost nitric oxide function and act as a more natural substitute for PDE5 inhibitors. There is anecdotal support for androgen therapy, and my 5 Ways to Boost Testosterone Naturally could come in handy for more natural alternatives.\n\nA systematic review published earlier this year found that going back on the original SSRI helped in 47% of cases of protracted SSRI withdrawal, while going on other drugs, such as benzodiazepines, pregabalin or propranolol only helped in 18% of cases. Three to six months of cognitive behavioral therapy helped in three out of three cases reported. The GABA-stimulating effects of benzodiazepines and pregabalin might be replicated in natural and more gentle ways with 100-800 milligrams per day of oral GABA, or chamomile.\n\nThis series has suggested throughout that mainstream progress on this topic is hamstrung by the commitment to the “psychiatric” theory of SSRIs and that real progress can only be made by looking at these drugs through a “mitochondrial” lens.\n\nHere are some ideas to try based on peering at the topic through this lens.\n\nNear Infrared Light\n\nOne case report showed that low-powered laser in the near infrared range on the scrotum and spine of a PSSD patient with no feeling in his genitals led to a 40% increase in penile sensitivity.\n\nInfrared light acts in part by feeding photons to complex IV (cytochrome oxidase), which improves its ability to facilitate ATP production. Further, near infrared also structures mitochondrial water to improve its viscosity in a way that facilitates greater production of ATP by ATP synthase.\n\nYou can apply therapeutic near infrared light from five to thirty minutes per day (700-1000 nanometers) on each part of the body. For example, Saunaspace (expensive, whole body), RedRush Pulse (less expensive, sit by it a lot, turn to face different sides), or LUMEBOX Red Light (even less expensive but small and you have to apply it to specific areas).\n\nThe best source of near infrared light is the sun, but you have to be very careful to manage not getting burned, and these devices allow a greater dose of near infrared without exposure to burning rays.\n\nRecent research suggests that infrared applied to one area in your body can benefit another. For example, when the light is applied to the chest, it improves vision. However, it makes the most sense focus on applying the therapeutic light to the most relevant part of your body, as long as you don’t shine it directly in your eyes. For example, try applying it to your head to see if it helps with brain zaps.\n\nCreatine is your mitochondria’s power grid.\n\nCreatine travels through the cell orders of magnitude faster than ATP, so it is the primary way you spread the energy produced by the mitochondria throughout the rest of the cell.\n\nAs I covered in Your Cells Are Starving For Creatine, everyone needs to optimize their creatine status. If you aren’t consuming one to two pounds of animal flesh per day, or if you aren’t consuming 500 grams per day each of quinoa and tofu, you almost certainly need to supplement with creatine.\n\nThe success story I shared earlier in the series, who reported at 8.5 months that “I've still been pretty amazed how effective your protocol has been. On the whole I feel like a whole different person from a year ago. It's wild” was using creatine as a central part of his protocol.\n\nHe had to start at 100 milligrams of creatine for a long time due to the twitches it caused him. He managed these with my strategies in Handling Creatine Side Effects.\n\nYou can start with a five-day loading dose of 20 grams per day followed by a 3-gram-per day maintenance dose, but if you have adverse effects you should start at a dose that doesn’t cause them, even if that means reverting to something as low as 100 milligrams. The loading dose helps you achieve muscle saturation quickly. You can also achieve muscle saturation by using 3 grams a day for a month. Creatine should be spread out into three or four doses per day taken before meals (not after meals), after exercise, or on an empty stomach to facilitate maximal absorption. After achieving muscle saturation, you can titrate up at one gram per day per week as high as 20 grams per day, but should stop at the point of maximal benefit, which might be around 3-5 grams, could be 7-8 grams, and for some people might be 20 grams.\n\nThe Mitome test had showed that this client had impaired transport of methyl groups into the mitochondria, and since creatine supports methylation, this may have made him respond especially well to the creatine. However, everyone needs to optimize their creatine status so this is a safe and fruitful path to embark on without testing first.\n\nThe animal evidence covered in Melatonin Is Your Mitochondria’s Guardian Angel suggests that secretion of melatonin at night by the pineal gland is a major source of mitochondrial melatonin throughout the body as cells clear it from the blood by taking it up and transporting much of it into their mitochondria. Less predictable stimulation of the hypoxia response during periodic hypoxic stress supplies the remainder of the melatonin by driving circulating serotonin into mitochondria where it is converted to melatonin.\n\nSSRIs likely deplete mitochondrial melatonin by depleting serotonin at a whole-body level and in most specific tissues outside the brain and gut, and by blocking the entry of serotonin into the mitochondria for melatonin synthesis.\n\nThe depletion of mitochondrial melatonin could lead to a vicious cycle where mitochondrial function is damaged from constant hypoxic signaling that respiration is unnecessary and a constant state of melatonin deficiency, thus hurting the ability of mitochondria to synthesize melatonin from serotonin, leaving them unable to lift themselves up by their bootstraps once the SSRI is taken away. Supplemental melatonin may therefore help break the vicious cycle.\n\nHuman trials of melatonin supplementation have used 5-10 milligrams per day for up to three months, 10-50 milligrams per day for up to one month, and 100-400 milligrams per day for up to two weeks, and 1000 milligrams on one single day. Case reports have used as many as 1600 milligrams per day for 24 days in individual patients. High-dose melatonin increases the risk of drowsiness, headache, and dizziness by 40%, but it does not increase the risk of severe adverse effects.\n\nOverall, high-dose melatonin appears safe for a limited period of time, with the safety of using 10-50 milligrams for up to a month demonstrated rather robustly.\n\nMost studies use melatonin at night, though some have used it in the day. I think it’s clear that melatonin should be used before bed so as not to disrupt the cyclical rise of plasma melatonin at night and its fall during the day. If you supplement before bed, the plasma level will rise more than usual, but this will also be rapidly cleared by cells that take it up and can deliver it to their mitochondria.\n\nThe use of melatonin in this manner should be thought of as a short-term repletion of the mitochondrial melatonin pool. This can be done with 10-50 milligrams of melatonin taken before bed for up to one month. You should be able to stop this cold turkey with no problems, but if you notice any decline in sleep quality during withdrawal you could try tapering it slowly.\n\nStrategies to Improve Mitochondrial Turnover\n\nSSRIs can dysregulate mitochondrial turnover by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new mitochondria) through specific serotonin receptors and by promoting mitophagy (breakdown of damaged mitochondria) through direct activation of the sigma-1 receptor.\n\nSSRIs with low sigma-1 activation are likely to overstimulate mitochondrial biogenesis relative to mitophagy, while those with high sigma-1 activation are likely to overstimulate mitophagy relative to mitochondrial biogenesis. Withdrawal from these SSRIs could do the opposite.\n\nSo, withdrawal from fluvoxamine and sertraline, which are strong sigma-1 activators, would be expected to cause a loss of sufficient mitophagy, while withdrawal from paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram would be expected to cause a loss of mitochondrial biogenesis. Fluoxetine would be in the middle.\n\nHowever, this also will depend on an individual’s genetic variation in all of the relevant receptors.\n\nMitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis are regulated by the supply and demand for mitochondrial energy metabolism. In general you need both demand for new mitochondria and supply of the substances needed to produce mitochondria.\n\nExercise is an excellent way to stimulate the demand side of mitochondrial biogenesis, where induction of an energetic deficit by the exercise can increase mitophagy and subsequent resting and refeeding can increase mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy could be seen as a form of exercise since it will create demand for mitochondrial energy production in all of the neural networks that support the cognitive and behavioral changes being stimulated in the same way bodily exercise does this for neural networks that promote strength and for energy production within muscle itself.\n\nYour exercise program should be designed relative to your capacity. If you are chronically fatigued and feel incapable of serious exercise, take what you can do, cut it down to 60-70%, and begin an exercise cycle where you aim to slowly do more over time so that by the end of twelve weeks you can do more than you had been able to at the start. If you see no change to your capacity, you may need to work harder. If you see yourself getting weaker and more fatigued as you do more work, you need to reduce your volume, frequency, duration, or intensity, or select an easier exercise, and rest more. Find the right pace of rest and recovery and take off bites you can chew.\n\nMy fasting-feeding reset is designed around a cyclical promotion of mitophagy in the fasting state and mitochondrial biogenesis in the fed state. It uses exercise and supplements to amplify each state on a cyclical basis. This is a well balanced approach. However, given the possibility that SSRI withdrawal has left you with a pronounced imbalance, it is important to pay close attention to your body’s responses and avoid excessive stress. If you find your resilience declining rather than improving, deemphasize the portion of the cycle that seems to be causing the most bodily stress. For example, you may want to greatly reduce the stimulation of the fasting part of the cycle while indulging more in the refeed or vice versa.\n\nWhile various supplements can be leveraged to globally increase mitophagy or mitochondrial biogenesis, this risks making a major imbalance worse.\n\nI recommend testing Mitome before doing this, which will tell you whether you are more imbalanced in one direction or the other and will put the relevant supplements directly into your protocol.\n\nAnother approach is intermittent hypobaric hypoxia training. As I covered in This Is 25x More Effective Than Antidepressants—And It's Not a Drug, animal studies indicate this is a powerful promoter of psychological resilience and it may be addressing the root cause of depression far more directly than SSRIs do.\n\nWhile I strongly promote everyone engaging in some degree of hypoxic stress as part of their health regimen, this is another case where Mitome testing would provide value. Too much hypoxia can hurt the respiratory chain, and idiosyncratic differences in the hypoxia response can underly the different responses to different SSRIs. Mitome can see whether your hypoxia regimen is excessive or just right and the protocol will help you adjust it.\n\n5-HTP for Certain SSRIs\n\nSSRIs with poor sigma-1 activation like paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram deplete serotonin even in the brain, and recovering from these might warrant supplementation with 200 to 900 milligrams per day of 5-HTP, with or without Seeking Health B6 as P5P 25 milligrams once a week to once a day.\n\nFluoxetine is in a gray area, whereas sertraline and fluvoxamine not likely to do this.\n\nSerotonin synthesis is likely to be restored with adequate protein (at least 1.2 grams per day per kilogram of ideal bodyweight), adequate micronutrients, and the proper assortment of stressors covered above like exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and intermittent hypoxia.\n\nHowever, the ability to support 5-HTP synthesis is complicated by a large number of nutritional cofactors, and while it does not occur in the mitochondria, it does depend on mitochondrial energy metabolism.\n\nThe ability to convert 5-HTP into serotonin is far more simple and only requires vitamin B6.\n\nSerotonin depletion is less likely to lock in a vicious cycle than mitochondrial melatonin depletion, which is why this is considered a possible adjunct for certain SSRIs rather than a general principle applied to withdrawal from any of them.\n\nRunner Up: Natural Sigma-1 Activation\n\nA few more things deserve some mention but their roles aren’t quite clear.\n\nChronic activation of the sigma-1 receptor by fluvoxamine or sertraline could leave it chronically underactivated during withdrawal. This receptor is never supposed to be chronically activated, so what SSRIs are doing to it is completely unnatural.\n\nWe know that it should be activated periodically during stress, so this is another case where healthy stressors like exercise and intermittent hypoxia become important. We don’t know what naturally activates it, but DHEA-sulfate, choline, myristic acid, and sphingolipids have all been suggested. Choline can be obtained from liver and egg yolks; myristic acid from coconut oil and butter; and sphingolipids from the fatty portions of a wide variety of foods, with unique compositions found in organ meats, fish, shellfish, mushrooms, whole grains, and fermented foods.\n\nMany Relevant Nutrients\n\nAs with any other health problem, you need to make sure you are hitting all of your nutrient targets. Track your diet in Cronometer to make sure you are hitting them on paper, and run the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening using the Cheat Sheet for interpretation to make sure your regimen is working to support your body’s unique needs.\n\nEveryone Is Different\n\nEveryone has variation in the specific strengths and weaknesses of their mitochondria, and assaults on the mitochondria that precipitate the onset of chronic mitochondrial dysfunction will reveal these deficits. Testing the mitochondria in the dysfunctional state can provide insight into what the limiting bottlenecks are, and can therefore add a highly individualized layer to your protocol that makes it specific to correcting your own dysfunction. Mitome tests your mitochondrial function with a cheek swab and delivers a personalized protocol that you could integrate with the SSRI-specific strategies outlined above.\n\nShare Your Experience in the Comments!\n\nIf you have SSRI withdrawal mitochondrial dysfunction and have tried some of these strategies, let us know what worked and didn’t work in the comments.\n\nTapering Off and Resolving Depression Without Drugs\n\nIf you are on SSRIs now and need a taper protocol, go here:\n\nHow to Taper off SSRIs\n\nAbout 29 million American adults, adolescents, and children are on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In many countries globally some 5-10% of the population are on SSRIs. These have become the first-line treatment for depression.\n\nIf you want to beat depression without the use of drugs, go here:\n\nBeat Depression Without SSRIs or Other Drugs\n\nThe first-line treatment for depression in modern society is SSRIs, but long-term SSRI use can cause sexual dysfunction, it can cause severe mitochondrial dysfunction in a rare subset of people, and years-long SSRI use leads to severe withdrawal syndromes becoming common and often leads to new-onset mitochondrial function that lasts years.\n\nSubtitle: The tenth and final installment in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.\n\nDescription: Scientific expertise blended with out-of-the-box thinking for new practical ideas you can use to help yourself on your journey to vibrant health, by Chris Masterjohn, PhD.",

    "title": "This Is 25x More Effective Than Antidepressants—And It's Not a Drug",
    "content": "In this article we will examine a potential treatment for depression that so far looks to be almost 25 times more effective than antidepressants and four times more effective than ketamine at creating long-term psychological resilience.\n\nMoreover, we will see that the impact of all three can be experimentally blocked in animals by blocking their impact on energy metabolism, which shows that the “psychiatric” model of how these drugs work to alleviate depression is wrong, and the “mitochondrial” or “energetic” model is correct.\n\nThis shows us that even when Pharma succeeds, it is flying blind and getting lucky.\n\nThe most important point, however, is that this nearly 25-fold (24-fold to be precise) better method is not a drug at all. It operates entirely outside the pharmaceutical model and is instead somewhat more akin to exercise, though the only fully natural way that our great-great-grandparents could have achieved it would have been to periodically travel into the mountains.\n\nThe core comparative study we will look at was done in mice, but we will put it in the context of the human research.\n\nWhile randomized controlled trials are the best way to determine whether an intervention causes a benefit in humans, animal studies are extremely valuable in their greater ability to infer mechanisms. “Mechanism” is a fancy way to say “why and how something works.” When you understand why and how something works, you can make much better decisions about how and when to use it as a tool. RCTs should be used to assemble what we know can work into our broader toolkit, while understanding how and why these tools work should be used to make wise decisions about what tool to use for the job.\n\nThe intervention we will look at is called hypobaric hypoxia training.\n\nThis is the opposite of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\n\nIt is used to induce tolerance to low blood oxygen levels caused by low atmospheric pressure in, for example, military pilots.\n\nWe saw earlier in this series that serotonin’s fundamental primary action is to act throughout the entire body to facilitate hypoxia tolerance, so it should not be surprising if we find that hypoxia is fundamental to depression.\n\nHypobaric hypoxia training can have adverse effects, including drowsiness that can onset hours after the training and could interfere with driving or operating machinery. If done without proper safety precautions, it carries all the same risks as altitude sickness. This often include transient headache, nausea, shortness of breath, an elevated stress response, getting sick, decreased cognitive performance, and lethargy while they more rarely can include delirium or even psychosis. Generally these respond to restoration of the oxygen level, so it would take some catastrophic misuse to generate the worst of these problems using a simulated altitude machine, whereas getting stuck in the mountains at a level of altitude you cannot tolerate can be harder to remedy quickly. Used properly, properly dosed hypoxia/altitude stress may be a safe and very powerful weapon to combat depression.\n\nThis article is not meant to suggest this as a first resort for depression — the basics of nutrient adequacy, a healthy lifestyle, and healthy mental practices should be the first resort — but rather to examine the fascinating prospects for this therapy and use it to properly understand the impact of SSRIs.\n\nNevertheless, I do believe that optimal health can best be produced with defined doses of hypoxic stress from periodic excursions to mountains or use of simulated altitude at sea level.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nAltitude, Hypoxia, and Depression\n\nIra Katz of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, NY proposed in 1982 that hypoxia could cause depression by interfering with neurotransmitter metabolism. His evidence was largely limited to experimental studies showing the dependence of neurotransmitter regulation on oxygen and indications that depression might result in some medical conditions that cause hypoxia.\n\nIn 2018, authors from the University of Utah and the Salt Lake City Veterans Affairs Medical Center collected the evidence tying altitude to depression in the Harvard Review of Psychiatry. In the United States, rates of depression and suicidality are highest in the mountain states, and correlations adjusted for age, race, and sex suggest that a state’s peak altitude explains 38% of its suicide rate while the altitude of its capital city explains 55% of its suicide rate. On a county basis, further controlling for income and population density, altitude explains 25% of the suicide rate. The effect size is large: high-altitude areas have a 3-fold higher rate of suicide than low-altitude areas. Similar results have been published for Spain, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and in Peruvian electrical workers, though two studies failed to find associations in Turkey and India.\n\nSix cases of new-onset panic disorder have been documented in travelers to the mountains of Nepal, anxiety has been found increased in mountaineers doing 55 days of simulated altitude training at the equivalent of 9000 meters, and depression and anger increased in US Marines doing simulated altitude training for thirty days at the equivalent of 2053 and 3600 meters.\n\nFinally, chronic illnesses that cause hypoxia such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause more depression and suicide risk than other chronic illnesses. Both asthma and cigarette smoking are specifically associated with depression and suicide when current. Past asthma has no such association, and the association with cigarette smoking wanes during smoking cessation and returns if smoking is resumed.\n\nWith the benefit of 36 more years of research, these authors were able to tie hypoxia to brain energetics and relate it to the positive studies on creatine for depression, whereas Katz was operating in the emerging “neurotransmitter” model of the brain, which had been taking the psychiatry world by storm in the wake of the popular obsession with psychedelics in the 1960s and 70s.\n\nStudies conflict about whether airline pilots have an increased or decreased risk of depression. Self-reported depression is higher among pilots, whereas official databases say they have less depression. My suspicion is that the databases are less accurate because pilots don’t want to get taken off the job by seeking a diagnosis. Suicidal airline pilots have killed 562 people in crashes since 1972, so pilot depression is considered a security risk and the incentive is to hide it.\n\nThe blood cells of airline pilots have massively increased expression of the serotonin receptor. Stuck in the “psychiatric” model of serotonin as expected, these authors commented that “a dysfunctional serotonergic system leads to abnormal neurotransmission and the development of psychiatric disorders. Although our study was performed on peripheral blood cells, some authors have proposed that alterations in PBMC could be a reflection of alterations in the central nervous system (CNS).”\n\nThus they failed to appreciate that the massive increase in the expression of the serotonin transporter of non-neuronal cells outside the brain in pilots is showing the extreme significance of serotonin to the whole-body hypoxia response, not its role in mediating “positive vibes” within the brain.\n\nMilitary pilots are often required to do hypobaric hypoxia training every few years, but its impact on depression is unstudied apart from the study of US Marines mentioned above. There are 25 papers that discuss the use of hypobaric hypoxia in airline pilots but they do not cover depression.\n\n24 Times More Powerful Than Antidepressants\n\nThe central mouse study we will consider compared the antidepressant effect of hypobaric hypoxia training to the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, with some side experiments that looked at ketamine.\n\nThe mice were subject to 70 days of chronic mild stress, including restraint, forced cold plunging, deprivation of food and water, tricking them with an empty water bottle, tilting their cage at a 45 degree angle, hours of strobe light exposure, and keeping them in a dirty, feces-full cage.\n\nMultiple tests were used for depression and anxiety, including their preference for sugar, the degree to which they groom their fur, their ability to stay swimming when forced into a bucket of water instead of giving up, their willingness to explore an open area, and the ease with which they became afraid of loud noises.\n\nThey were split into four groups with treatments thrown into the middle of the chronic stress period: injection with imipramine or a saline control for four weeks, or exposure to four hours a day of hypobaric hypoxia equivalent to 5000 meters (16,400 feet) or a normoxic control for two weeks.\n\nThe difference in how long the treatments lasted is stunning:\n\nThe antidepressant effect of imipramine faded away one week after treatment.\n\nThe antidepressant effect of imipramine faded away one week after treatment.\n\nThe antidepressant effect of hypobaric hypoxia lasted at least 12 weeks after treatment.\n\nThe antidepressant effect of hypobaric hypoxia lasted at least 12 weeks after treatment.\n\nThe actual treatment shows an at least 12-fold longer-lasting effect of hypobaric hypoxia.\n\nThe imipramine was used for twice as long, so we could say from one perspective that it was 24-fold more powerful. However, the experiment was stopped there, so it lasts at least this long, and perhaps much longer.\n\nThey performed a number of more limited side experiments that showed the following:\n\nBlocking the hypoxia response at a molecular level abolished the antidepressant effects of hypobaric hypoxia training, imipramine, and ketamine.\n\nBlocking the hypoxia response at a molecular level abolished the antidepressant effects of hypobaric hypoxia training, imipramine, and ketamine.\n\nChemically activating the hypoxia response by injecting cobalt chloride into the brainstem produced an antidepressant effect that lasted at least seven days.\n\nChemically activating the hypoxia response by injecting cobalt chloride into the brainstem produced an antidepressant effect that lasted at least seven days.\n\nMore Powerful Than Ketamine?\n\nThis study showed that activation of the hypoxia response mediates ketamine’s effects, but did not compare the robustness of the response to ketamine over time.\n\nNevertheless, there is a significant body of human literature on ketamine that we can compare this to.\n\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic. While it had been used for human surgery in the past it is now mostly used for veterinary surgery. It is used illegally and recreationally for its dissociative and hallucinogenic effects. Dissociation refers to detachment from emotional and physical reality.\n\nA single infusion produces a powerful antidepressant effect, but its utility is limited by the fact that the doses required generally produce some degree of dissociation and often cause a rise in blood pressure. The impact of a single infusion lasts for one to two weeks.\n\nKetamine is primarily known as an NMDA receptor antagonist. Since schizophrenia involves NMDA receptor hypofunction, there is analogy between the ketamine-induced state and the schizophrenic state, which earns it a place in the category of “psychotomimetics.”\n\nControversy exists over whether the dissociative effects mediate the antidepressant effects. If they do, this would fit into a “psychiatric” model of its impact rather than an “energetic” model because modulating neurotransmitter systems to achieve perceptual changes and psychological experiences would be the central mechanism of the drug.\n\nOn the one hand, most people experience some degree of mild dissociation during ketamine-based antidepressant treatment. On the other hand, while this does predict the antidepressant response, correlation coefficients indicate that it only predicts 4-17% of the response. This correlation is hardly evidence of causation. The dissociation could reflect a combination of the dose and distribution of the drug as well as the the sensitivity of the individual’s receptors to it. That is, it could essentially be an index of the “individually-adjusted dose.” The dissociative effect also represents a powerful capacity for a placebo effect. Regardless, 4-17% of the explanation of the variation is simply a weak proportion of the antidepressant effect. The perceptual changes are either entirely incidental to the antidepressant effect or play a minor role in it.\n\nGiven that its impact is blocked by molecularly blocking the hypoxia response in mice, the “mitochondrial” or “energetic” model is a much better explanation of the ketamine effect, just as it is for SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants.\n\nThat the antidepressant effect of ketamine tends to last one to two weeks suggests hypobaric hypoxia training could be 6-12 times more effective than it, using the mouse study.\n\nBut this is based on single infusions.\n\nThere are isolated case reports of multiple ketamine infusions leading to remaining depression-free for six months to a year. However, larger studies show that this is not the normal result:\n\nIn a study of 10 people receiving six infusions over two weeks, the antidepressant effect lasted three weeks after the treatment was stopped.\n\nIn a study of 10 people receiving six infusions over two weeks, the antidepressant effect lasted three weeks after the treatment was stopped.\n\nIn 11 people receiving 10-51 infusions over six to 49 weeks, four people continued on the maintenance regimen, four stopped because it stopped working, two stopped for unknown reasons, and one stopped because their 51st infusion caused a level of dissociation and restlessness that made them not want to use it again. This indicates that you cannot maintain the effect perpetually because it will stop working before you stop using it in many cases, or you may run into a wall of adverse psychological effects.\n\nIn 11 people receiving 10-51 infusions over six to 49 weeks, four people continued on the maintenance regimen, four stopped because it stopped working, two stopped for unknown reasons, and one stopped because their 51st infusion caused a level of dissociation and restlessness that made them not want to use it again. This indicates that you cannot maintain the effect perpetually because it will stop working before you stop using it in many cases, or you may run into a wall of adverse psychological effects.\n\nIn 15 people receiving six infusions over 12 days, one dropped out after the first infusion because it caused fatigue an irritability, one dropped out after the second because it didn’t work, and one received no benefit even after the sixth infusion. Of the remaining twelve, nine achieved remission and three partially improved. In half of the twelve who got some benefit, half were still benefitted four weeks out while the other half relapsed in an average of 16 days. Nevertheless, many of them had declining neurocognitive and mental health scores between one and two weeks after treatment ended, and everyone was in decline after the 2-week mark.\n\nIn 15 people receiving six infusions over 12 days, one dropped out after the first infusion because it caused fatigue an irritability, one dropped out after the second because it didn’t work, and one received no benefit even after the sixth infusion.

Nevertheless, many of them had declining neurocognitive and mental health scores between one and two weeks after treatment ended, and everyone was in decline after the 2-week mark.\n\nIn 12 people receiving six infusions over two weeks and then four weekly followup infusions, five people dropped out before the initial six infusions were over. Two withdrew because of adverse effects, one stopped because it wasn’t working, and two withdrew because the ketamine was making their depression get worse. Two subjects partially improved and five achieved remission. In the four weeks that followed ketamine treatment, only one remained in remission. The remitters all remained better four weeks out than they had been pre-ketamine, but they were also losing their peak benefit within one week after the last ketamine treatment.\n\nIn 12 people receiving six infusions over two weeks and then four weekly followup infusions, five people dropped out before the initial six infusions were over.

One dropout reported becoming suicidal and another dropout reported becoming manic. 26 achieved remission and 20 more had a positive response. The antidepressant effect lasted robustly through the two weeks of followup.\n\nIn 100 people receiving six infusions over 12 days, 13 people dropped out during the infusion period and 10 more dropped out during the two-week followup. One dropout reported becoming suicidal and another dropout reported becoming manic. 26 achieved remission and 20 more had a positive response. The antidepressant effect lasted robustly through the two weeks of followup.\n\nThe most robust finding is that a ketamine infusion produces an antidepressant effect lasting one to two weeks. There is some indication that multiple infusions produce a longer-lasting effect that appears to max out in three to four weeks but be quite variable between individuals.\n\nSo we can be generous to ketamine and say that hypobaric hypoxia training lasts three to four times as long as a round of multiple ketamine infusions.\n\nMany people are poor candidates for ketamine from the getgo. The ability to indefinitely sustain infusions to avoid this wearing off seems doubtful, and dragging them out over a year seems to often cause the ketamine to lose efficacy and sometimes become harmful.\n\nOther Hypoxia Studies in Rats\n\nThe authors of the mouse study discussed above had conducted another earlier study in rats showing that intermittent hypoxia is similar in the magnitude of its antidepressant effect to Prozac and imipramine and that it lasts at least seven days after stopping the treatment, but did not compare its duration to that of the drugs.\n\nA different group showed that in female rats but not male rats, altitude at 4500 feet or simulated altitude at 10,000 feet and 20,000 feet for one week caused a dose-dependent worsening on tests of depression and anxiety that were conducted at 4500 feet where the lab was situated. In another study this same group showed that female rats become anxious and anhedonic after altitude exposure.\n\nThe difference between these models is that the group showing benefits ran the tests a week after the hypoxia, whereas the group showing negative results seems to have run the tests immediately after removing the rats from their chambers.\n\nIf you view hypoxia stress similar to exercise, these findings are easy to reconcile. Right after exercising, your ability to complete the same task has gone down. Once you recover, your ability has gone up.\n\nIntermittent Hypoxia Is an Essential Stimulus to Produce Positive Adaptations\n\nThe best way to synthesize all of this is that impaired oxidative energy production in the brain drives depression and anxiety, while SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and ketamine are in variable ways helping to modify the response to this problem.\n\nWhile the literature even on the antidepressant effect of ketamine is far more robust than the literature on the same effect of hypobaric hypoxia (where we only have rodent studies), and while the literature on SSRIs is yet more vast, the rodent studies on hypobaric hypoxia indicate it could be a vastly superior way to produce a long-lasting antidepressant effect.\n\nThere are hundreds of reasons that anyone at sea level could have impaired brain energy metabolism, but in people who live at altitude, chronic hypoxia is excessive and plays a major role in depression and suicide.\n\nThe increased risk of depression and suicide at moderate altitude coexists with a lower all-cause mortality risk, which shows that this degree of altitude stress is causing a tradeoff, showing the dose has some benefits but is not optimal.\n\nWhile chronic altitude stress raises the risk of depression and suicide, small doses of altitude stress can improve the brain’s ability to thrive under such stress, and thereby support psychological resilience.\n\nIn my review of the literature on simulated or real altitude raising testosterone in men, I concluded that 10-12 hours of 6500 feet using a simulated altitude tent three times a week is the best-performing protocol used in humans, which makes me hope that this can be consolidated to 5-6 days per month spent hiking, skiing, snowboarding, or doing whatever you want at the top of a mountain about 6500 feet above sea level.\n\nIn male boxers and cyclists, stacking the hypoxia stress for five or six days starts to cause the acute loss of the initial testosterone benefit, while spacing the protocol out three times a week allows the benefits to be maintained indefinitely, at least as far as has been studied. However, I believe that 5-6 days in the mountains would slightly push you into “overreach” from which you would bounce back more hypoxia-fit, testosterone-loaded, and psychologically resilient, while the rest of the month at sea level would allow you to reset your capacity to handle another round.\n\nIn non-athletes and recovering drug addicts, testosterone increases linearly during a month spent hiking the mountains of Tibet. While you could propose that natural mountain exposure is healthier than simulated altitude exposure, this cannot explain why depression and suicide is higher in people naturally living at altitude. Therefore, I believe the answer is that high-level athletic activity is already adding enough into the physical stress bucket that they become very sensitive to exceeding the optimal dose, whereas people who are sedentary are chronically physically understressed and can take longer to accrue the initial benefits.\n\nNevertheless, athletic activity is the vocation of everyone who has a body, as Nike cofounder Bill Bowerman once pointed out, so I think we should take the studies in boxers and cyclists as a provisional target for the optimal dose of hypoxia stress. This indicates that you want the equivalent of 15-20% of your time being spent at 6500 feet. We need more research to understand how changing the exact altitude changes the proportion of time that should be spent in it. For example, maybe we could spend two or three days per month at 12,000 feet.\n\nTo replicate the protocol of the human studies, you can use an altitude tent during sleep and part of the evening for 10-12 hours three times a week and can probably substitute a simulated altitude mask.\n\nIf you live at altitude, you may already have an excessive hypoxia response. If you cannot change where you live, you can take the opposite approach. Start using an oxygen machine at a low, practical dose such as an hour a day, and titrate it up to where you start seeing improved mood and psychological resilience. Then, continue titrating it slowly by increasing the dose a little each week. When you reach the point of diminishing returns, stay there or pull back a little. Hypothetically you would want to achieve something equivalent to sea level for 80-85% of your total hours, but you may find that the minimal dose producing the maximal effect you are seeking is lower than that.\n\nIn the first article in this series, we saw that exercise is a more effective antidepressant than Prozac in mice, while Prozac is an exercise-enhancing drug that increases muscle mass and grip strength.\n\nWe then saw that a central role of serotonin is to mediate the hypoxia response.\n\nWe built on this to see that SSRIs modulate this role of serotonin in promoting mitochondrial tolerance of oxygen deprivation and even enter the cell to have their own impacts on mitochondrial function.\n\nWe now see that intermittent hypoxia has a much longer-lasting antidepressant impact than any pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nAll of this converges on seeing depression as fundamentally about mitochondrial energy production and the impact of these drugs being far more about intersecting with mitochondrial energy production than modulating psychological effects of specific neurotransmitters.\n\nThe final post in this series addresses how to deal with SSRI withdrawal-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Read it here:\n\nWhat to Do About SSRI Withdrawal Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nSo far in this series we have seen the following:\n\nSubtitle: Installment nine in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.\n\nDescription: Installment nine in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.",

    "title": "SSRIs Can Cause Severe Mitochondrial Dysfunction",
    "content": "In at least one out of 5,500 people – possibly at a much higher rate due to ignorance and underdiagnosis – sertraline (Zoloft) is such a potent mitochondrial poison that it can induce a devastating disease that has heretofore been thought to be a much rarer genetic disorder.\n\nAdult-onset multiple acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), also known as glutaric aciduria type II, is considered a rare genetic metabolic disorder with an incidence of one in 250,000, characterized by fat accumulation in skeletal muscle, exercise intolerance, and pain or weakness in the muscles.\n\nMany cases may include other features, such as episodic vomiting, fatigue, difficult or rapid breathing, seizures, hypoglycemia, inflammation of the prostate, sensory neuropathy, and damage to the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle.\n\nIt turns out that sertraline (Zoloft) is 45 times more effective at inducing this otherwise genetic disorder than genetics themselves are.\n\nIn southeastern Sweden, there had been zero cases identified between 2004 and 2013.\n\nSertraline (Zoloft) was approved in Sweden in 2006 and in 2012 it became recommended as the first-line treatment for anxiety and depression. This increased the prescription rate by 48%. As of last year, 3.5% of people in Sweden were on sertraline.\n\nWhereas zero cases of adult-onset MADD were diagnosed in southeastern Sweden between 2004 and 2013, nine cases were diagnosed between 2014 and 2024, but only two of them had a clear genetic basis.\n\nIn 2023, a North American group published a conference poster showing a woman who had a MADD-like biochemical profile on sertraline. The profile completely normalized with two measurements taken off sertraline. Going back on sertraline made the biochemical profile diagnostic for MADD again.\n\nThis prompted the neurology unit of the Linköping University Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences in southeastern Sweden to retrospectively analyze these cases for an environmental cause. All seven of the patients with no genetic explanation were on sertraline, and no other drug was taken by more than two people.\n\nWhereas MADD is considered an extremely rare genetic disorder impacting one in 250,000, these cases imply that one in 5,500 sertraline users develops MADD. This is still rare, but it is no longer extremely rare. It implies that sertraline increases the risk of MADD 45-fold.\n\nThe publication of this paper rapidly led to similar retrospective analyses in western Sweden, North America, and Australia, bringing the total number of sertraline-induced MADD cases reported last year to thirty, with an additional two cases possibly attributable to the use of venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta), which are considered SNRIs rather than SSRIs because they inhibit the uptake of norepinephrine alongside that of serotonin.\n\nThat this one inquiry led to the immediate discovery of 30 cases of sertraline-induced late-onset MADD in just four of the world’s 197 countries is quite remarkable given that the total number of genetic cases ever reported worldwide is close to 600.\n\nIt is even more shocking when you see that, as we cover below, genetic MADD is cured with food-achievable doses of riboflavin, while sertraline-induced MADD seems to require going off sertraline to fix, and some people even then do not even recover but are left permanently or quasi-permanently with weakness, pain, neuropathy, and difficulty breathing.\n\nThree case reports of genetic MADD published between 2012 and 2022 mentioned the patient was on sertraline without any further comment. Most MADD case reports do not even catalog the medications the patient is on at the time of symptom onset.\n\nIn severe cases, MADD and other disorders causing fat accumulation in muscle can lead to rhabdomyolysis, often but not always in response to exercise. This is a state of muscle breakdown where muscle proteins spill into the urine and make it darkly colored. Four case reports have been published on sertraline-induced rhabdomyolysis where it was not investigated whether it was driven by MADD. Given the other findings, these are likely severe cases of sertraline-induced MADD.\n\nGiven the general ignorance of this phenomenon and the fact that the question has not been asked in 193 out of 197 countries, these reports are surely just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThis is the eigth installment in our series on the truth about serotonin and SSRIs.\n\nGenetic Causes of MADD\n\nMADD is considered a result of pathogenic mutations in the electron transferring flavoprotein dehydrogenase system, consisting of proteins encoded by the genes ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH. This system is responsible for delivering electrons to the mitochondrial respiratory chain from the oxidation of all fatty acids; the amino acids lysine and tryptophan; the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine; and from dimethylglycine and sarcosine, which can be derived from glycine, choline, or betaine (trimethylglycine or TMG). The respiratory chain then uses these electrons to produce ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. A backup in this system fundamentally impairs cellular energy production.\n\nThe system is dependent on riboflavin in the form of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), so high-dose riboflavin supplementation is often helpful by improving the amount of FAD that can bind to, activate, stabilize the proteins involved and ensure their proper three-dimensional folding. Due to the importance of riboflavin, mutations that hurt riboflavin metabolism (in FLAD1, SLC25A32, SLC52A1, SLC52A2, and SLC52A3 genes) can also cause MADD.\n\nWhile not often acknowledged as a cause of MADD, impairments in the respiratory chain from the point downstream of the ETF dehydrogenase system, from CoQ10 through complexes III and IV, could cause similar metabolic impairments.\n\nRiboflavin deficiency, while it also has broader effects, is sufficient to cause an acquired form of MADD.\n\nOne of the major hallmarks is that an acylcarnitine profile shows many acylcarnitine species broadly elevated. These are carnitine-based detoxification products of intermediates in metabolic pathways that could not be completed. For example, derivatives of fatty acids or amino acids that are not fully oxidized will be detoxified using carnitine and will show up on the acylcarnitine profile.\n\nThe Centrality of Food-Level Riboflavin to Genetic MADD\n\nBizarrely, riboflavin status is often not even measured in this disorder, despite it universally being recognized to often be fixed by riboflavin supplementation. Instead, they just put people on high doses (10-150 milligrams per day in some cohorts, in others 300-400 milligrams or more) of riboflavin without testing whether riboflavin-rich foods or low-dose supplements would have worked.\n\nOut of almost 110 cases at one center, a total of 15 people had their riboflavin tested prior to being treated with riboflavin, and they all had lower riboflavin status than healthy controls.\n\nThis raises the question of whether suboptimal riboflavin status is required to cause MADD in genetically susceptible individuals. If so, this contrasts wildly with the perception that high doses are required to fix a problem that could not be fixed with food or low-dose supplements.\n\nOut of 48 patients with long-term followup in this cohort, the average dose used was 68 milligrams per day and the average followup was 10 months, and all 48 were “cured.”\n\nRiboflavin generally cured them within two months. 30 of them stopped taking the riboflavin, but in 17 of them the disorder came back and went away when they resumed riboflavin. Some of them stayed on high doses and some of them transitioned to low doses or intermittent doses and none of this made a difference in the treatment outcome.\n\nThe return of the disorder after abandoning riboflavin was triggered by stressors such as physical exhaustion, catching a cold, drinking alcohol, or getting pregnant.\n\nThe patient in this case series who proved he only needed small doses of riboflavin to cure himself was one who initially cured himself in two months with 10 milligrams per day. Over the course of nine years, every time he had an attack of muscle weakness, he took five milligrams per day and it disappeared within a week.\n\nClearly he started from a very deficient position that needed a higher dose and duration to fix, then he progressed extremely slowly back across the threshold of deficiency and could pull himself out of it with a lower dose for a shorter period of time.\n\nAs I have covered in my abundant riboflavin materials, you can absorb 37 milligrams of riboflavin at a meal despite needs ranging from 1 to 6 milligrams per day. So these cases where people are cured with 150 milligrams are likely flushing high concentrations of riboflavin through the system to fix the deficiency quickly, then when the deficiency is fixed, the disorder disappears until riboflavin status sufficiently declines to the deficient state again.\n\nGenetic MADD thus appears to be remarkably similar to MTHFR C677T in its riboflavin requirement, where bringing riboflavin from 1.6 milligrams per day to 3.2 milligrams a day fully resolves the function of the enzyme.\n\nWhile the medical treatment of MADD seems largely incompetent in its failure to assess riboflavin status and use the minimal effective dose, the supplement industry is completely incompetent. If genetic cases of MADD only need 5 milligrams long-term, how is it even conceivable that the average person without a rare genetic disorder needs more? Yet it is nearly impossible to find a supplement of riboflavin less than 100 milligrams. Exceptions include a 36.5 milligram Thorne supplement or a 6.5-milligram liquid supplement, but even the Thorne supplement is quite high and not everyone’s digestive system will tolerate the glycerin in the liquid supplement.\n\nIn this cohort, recurrence and severity was not related to the specific gene mutations but was higher in people eating a vegetarian diet, which is generally low in riboflavin compared to an omnivorous diet.\n\nThis is because the best food for riboflavin is liver; the second-best foods are kidney, heart, and almonds; the third-best foods are red meat, cheese, eggs, salmon, mushrooms, seaweed, sesame, and wheat germ and bran; the fourth-best foods are milk and most other meats. Thus, you can design a vegetarian diet to be rich in riboflavin if you focus on almonds, mushrooms, seaweed, sesame, and whole wheat, but the average omnivore is going to get more by eating meat, eggs, and dairy food, and you have to eat organs to push your riboflavin up to the top of the range.\n\nThe one other risk factor for recurrence aside from vegetarianism was weakness in the muscles used for chewing. This is probably because these people had more difficulty eating food and therefore were more malnourished.\n\nThis is a rather shocking indication that the quantity of riboflavin in foods – most people get 1 milligram per day from food and you might hit 6 milligrams if you really design your diet around it – is more powerful a driver of MADD than genetics are.\n\nThat is, genetics load the gun and your diet pulls the trigger, with the trigger being very sensitive to the difference between 1 and 6 milligrams of riboflavin.\n\nUnfortunately, riboflavin does not straightforwardly cure sertraline-induced MADD, where the operant variable is that the patients are poisoning their mitochondria with a pill their doctor gave them.\n\nSertraline-Induced MADD in Southeastern Sweden\n\nIn the cohort of sertraline-induced MADD in southeastern Sweden, nine patients presented with constant muscle weakness, usually in the legs more than the arms. Six of them had neck weakness, and in three of them their necks were so weak they physically couldn’t hold their head up.\n\nSix had various manifestations of neuropathy, with numbness, pain, or sensory disturbances in the hands, feet, and lower legs. Three had cramps, two had episodic vomiting, and one became severely tired after fasting and was found to be suffering from acidosis.\n\nAll of them had accumulations of fat in their muscles. Two had fatty liver. One had low muscle CoQ10 content.\n\nThe authors state that none had altered respiratory chain activity, but they do not describe the details of which parts of the respiratory chain were tested nor do they show the data, so this has to be treated skeptically. For example they could have been testing something like oxygen consumption in response to malate, glutamate, pyruvate, or succinate, which would qualify as testing respiratory chain activity, but would shine no light on the nature of an impairment in the ETF dehydrogenase system.\n\nNone of them had classical signs of riboflavin deficiency. However, consistent with the nutritional neglect that broadly characterizes medicine across the board, none of them had their riboflavin tested.\n\nTwo of them had been on cholesterol-lowering statins, which made their condition worse. When they stopped the statins, they partially improved. This is straightforward since statins are well established mitochondrial toxins.\n\nWhile several of them were taking folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin D, proton pump inhibitors, thyroid meds, anti-convulsants, steroids, or ACE inhibitors, none of the vitamins were used by more than four people and none of the drugs were used by more than two people. None of them were taking drugs expected to cause myopathy as a side effect.\n\nTwo of them had a clear genetic causation to the MADD and the other seven were all on sertraline.\n\nThe onset of symptoms occurred between five months and eight years after starting sertraline. Three patients had case histories showing a dose response: one developed symptoms after increasing the dose from 50 to 75 milligrams and the other two after increasing the dose from 100 to 150 milligrams.\n\nThree of them had been on Effexor, Paxil, or Lexapro prior to Zoloft without having developed muscle problems.\n\nAll patients received 150-300 milligrams per day of riboflavin, while two patients also received two grams per day of carnitine, and one also received 1050 milligrams per day of CoQ10. Four fully recovered, four got better, and one showed no improvement and currently suffers from trouble breathing, sensory disturbances, and pain and weakness in the muscles.\n\nAll of the patients showed normalization of the fat content of their muscles despite one remaining symptomatic.\n\nSeven of the patients had their acylcarnitines go back up without symptoms returning, implying that the metabolic disorder was reactivating despite continued riboflavin treatment.\n\nOnce the retrospective analysis raised suspicion of sertraline, sertraline was discontinued. There were five patients who had elevated acylcarnitines at the time of sertraline discontinuation and in all five cases the acylcarnitines dramatically improved after stopping the sertraline:\n\nThe return of elevated acylcarnitines while on riboflavin could imply a few things:\n\nSertraline was causing more and more damage over time, and eventually its damage outweighed the benefit of the riboflavin.\n\nSertraline was causing more and more damage over time, and eventually its damage outweighed the benefit of the riboflavin.\n\nThe riboflavin itself was a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it improved the ability to complete the oxidation of fatty acids. On the other hand, excessive long-term high-dose riboflavin-loading encouraged the body to increase the oxidation of fatty acids, thereby putting more load into the disrupted pathway.\n\nThe riboflavin itself was a double-edged sword.

On the other hand, excessive long-term high-dose riboflavin-loading encouraged the body to increase the oxidation of fatty acids, thereby putting more load into the disrupted pathway.\n\nWhile symptoms may not have returned, the return of the elevated acylcarnitines was probably a leading indicator that metabolic disruption was returning and that symptoms would have come in the future if the problem had remained unsolved.\n\nWhile symptoms may not have returned, the return of the elevated acylcarnitines was probably a leading indicator that metabolic disruption was returning and that symptoms would have come in the future if the problem had remained unsolved.\n\nThe authors unfortunately did not explicitly comment on whether sertraline withdrawal made the one remaining symptomatic patient better, worse, or no different. They imply that the patient was still symptomatic at the time the report was written, indicating that sertraline had caused permanent or quasi-permanent damage, or that something beyond sertraline discontinuation was required to fix it.\n\nIt is also unclear whether “no clinical improvement” means this patient remained entirely in the same state or had actually gotten worse on the original riboflavin-based treatment.\n\nSertraline-Induced MADD in Western Sweden\n\nThe group from western Sweden found 17 individuals diagnosed with a lipid storage myopathy at the neuromuscular center in Gothenburg between 2015 and 2023. Two had a clear genetic diagnosis. Of the remaining 15, 12 agreed to further investigation, during which it was revealed that 11 of them were on sertraline at the time of diagnosis. These 11 were then further studied.\n\nThey all had weakness in the muscles closest to the center of the body, while most also had weakness in their extremities and about half had weakness in their neck. Most had muscle pain and sensory disturbances, while three had trouble swallowing.\n\nMuscle biopsy showed fat accumulation in their muscles. They measured mitochondrial respiratory chain protein expression, but not enzymatic activity. There are dozens of proteins in the respiratory chain complexes, so they measured a representative protein from each complex. They also stained the tissues using antibodies to complexes I, II, and IV but not complex III. Overall these results suggested a profound defect in complex I, with mild and variable deficits of complexes II and IV and no evidence of a deficit in the more limited measurements of complex III.\n\nTheir mitochondria were abnormally small and numerous, with small numbers of them being abnormally big, and some appearing round with abnormal structures inside them.\n\nThey had no evidence of harm to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), though they had almost double the average number of mtDNA copies, suggesting their mitochondria were duplicating their DNA more than normal.\n\nThey then studied the total breadth of protein abundance (the “proteome”) of the muscles and found that nearly 2000 proteins were expressed differently in these patients compared to healthy controls. Proteins involved in helping the respiratory chain complexes assemble were upregulated, while the actual proteins that make up the respiratory chain (the subunits) tended to be downregulated. Complex I subunits were strongly downregulated, complexes II and IV more weakly so, and complexes III and V (V is ATP synthase) remained the same or were upregulated.\n\nMost enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation were upregulated, but ETFDH, which encodes ETF dehydrogenase and funnels electrons to the CoQ10 pool of the respiratory chain, was downregulated.\n\nThese last two changes alone would explain elevated acylcarnitines, since fatty acid oxidation being upregulated means there is more input into the pathway whereas ETFDH being downregulated means the pathway cannot run to completion. Fatty acids that start getting oxidized but can’t finish getting oxidized are the main driver of acylcarnitine accumulation.\n\nCitrate synthase was upregulated, probably reflecting greater numbers of mitochondria. Together with doubled mtDNA content, this suggests increased mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nThese patients had no evidence of genetic variants that could alter sertraline metabolism.\n\nThe authors did not measure riboflavin status, nor did they report treating these individuals with riboflavin or with sertraline withdrawal.\n\nSertraline-Induced MADD in North America\n\nThe North American group reported two cases of sertraline-associated MADD.\n\nThe first was a 26-year-old woman diagnosed with depression, profound fatigue, “psychogenic non-epileptic seizures,” subclinical hypothyroidism, and heart palpitations. Her acylcarnitine profile appeared as MADD.\n\nShe was counseled to take riboflavin and carnitine, avoid fasting, and to increase caloric intake when ill. This did not normalize her acylcarnitine profile.\n\nHowever, going off sertraline did normalize her acylcarnitine profile, and going back on sertraline made it abnormal again:\n\nThere were two measurements showing it normalized while off sertraline rather than just one, so this is especially compelling evidence that the sertraline was elevating the acylcarnitines and that random variation was not creating this as an illusion.\n\nWhen combined with the data from southeastern Sweden, where five people all had their acylcarnitines normalize when they went off sertraline, we have two different angles – multiple measurements in one person, single measurements in multiple people – arguing against random variation and in favor of a real effect of sertraline.\n\nAfter three months of staying on riboflavin and carnitine while eliminating sertraline, the first North American case reported “mild improvement in fatigue.”\n\nThe second case was a 61-year-old woman with chronic fatigue, exercise intolerance, weakness in the muscles closest to her trunk, and excessive tightness in her legs.\n\nAfter a few months of these symptoms, she went to the ER after fainting and having difficulty swallowing and opening her mouth.\n\nThe ER found her in metabolic acidosis with rapidly increasing creatine kinase, a MADD-like acylcarnitine profile, and normal urinary organic acids.\n\nMuscle biopsy showed fat accumulation and excessive proliferation of mitochondria with abnormal structures inside them.\n\nAnalysis of her respiratory chain activity showed isolated complex II deficiency.\n\nFurther investigation revealed she was on sertraline and had increased her dose of sertraline to 100 milligrams per day shortly before her ER visit. She was advised to discontinue it, and this made her creatine kinase rapidly return to normal.\n\nShe was further advised to take riboflavin and to moderate fat and protein.\n\nAfter two years of taking riboflavin but avoiding sertraline, a repeat muscle biopsy showed her complex II activity had returned to normal and she no longer had fat accumulation.\n\nLike the Swedish groups, the North American groups did not measure anyone’s riboflavin status.\n\nIt is very odd that they do not report anything about clinical improvement of the second case. Did her chronic fatigue, exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, and tightness improve as her muscle biopsy and respiratory chain activity normalized? Did she have any more episodes of fainting or difficulty swallowing or opening her mouth?\n\nThe silence on this question suggests she did not clinically improve, as was seen in one riboflavin-treated patient in the southeastern Swedish paper.\n\nThe first case had only “mild improvement” in fatigue, suggesting she was resistant to both riboflavin and sertraline discontinuation.\n\nSertraline-Induced MADD in Australia\n\nIn the Australian cohort, five of the eighteen cases of adult-onset MADD had traditional diagnostic criteria fulfilled for genetic MADD. Of the thirteen remaining, ten were on sertraline. Of the remaining three, one was on venlafaxine (Effexor) and one was on duloxetine (Cymbalta), both of which are SNRIs rather than SSRIs, which means they also inhibit the synaptic reuptake of norepinephrine alongside serotonin. Eight of the ten sertraline-associated cases had muscle biopsies performed, and all of them showed abnormal fat accumulation in the muscle. The patient on venlafaxine had a muscle biopsy and it showed mild inflammation but not fat accumulation.\n\nOnly eight of the eighteen adults in the combined adult-onset MADD cohort had riboflavin tested prior to starting riboflavin. Of them, half had low or borderline low riboflavin before starting supplementation. Of those who had normal riboflavin status, one was not prescribed riboflavin and the other three were. They did not respond to riboflavin at all. Among the four who had suboptimal status, three responded well to riboflavin treatment. While baseline riboflavin status was a critical determinant of the response to riboflavin, the genetic analysis had no ability to predict the response to riboflavin.\n\nThis again underscores that riboflavin “treatment” in MADD is overwhelmingly about optimizing riboflavin status and not on “treating” a highly specific genetic requirement for supraphysiological riboflavin concentrations.\n\nAll three patients who responded well to riboflavin had genetic MADD.\n\nThe anti-depressant associated MADD had a unique and different response to riboflavin. Riboflavin normalized the acylcarnitine profile in three and improved it in two, while failing to do anything in the others. The one patient taking venlafaxine had the acylcarnitine profile do nothing at first, but normalized six months after starting riboflavin. All of the patients whose acylcarnitine profile normalized or improved after riboflavin supplementation had them subsequently worsen several months later.\n\nThis is exactly what was observed in the southeastern Swedish cohort: riboflavin initially improved the acylcarnitine profile, then it worsened. The only difference is the Australian study did not take the patients off sertraline, so it was not able to show the renormalization of the profile after discontinuing the drug.\n\nOf the four adult patients with suboptimal riboflavin status, three were on sertraline. Riboflavin induced complete recovery only in the one patient who was not on sertraline. In the three on sertraline, one had no response and the other two appeared to improve biochemically at first but then reverted back to their initial biochemical profile without improving clinically.\n\nThis is inconsistent with the tendency to improve clinically in the southeastern Swedish cohort and it emphasizes that there is a subset of people with sertraline-induced MADD who do not get better on riboflavin.\n\nUnfortunately, the Australian paper did not report the doses of riboflavin used, and left us with the cryptic statement that they are now “trialing higher dose riboflavin in these patients” to see if it can indeed overcome the effect of sertraline. They speculated without any evidence that sertraline may interfere with the binding of FAD to ETF or ETFDH and therefore it may respond to supraphysiological riboflavin doses.\n\nIt is bizarre that they are not “trialling sertraline withdrawal” as the Australian medical establishment, unlike the North American or Swedish establishments, evidently consider it important to maintain their patients on the mitochondrial toxin they were originally prescribed.\n\nThe signal for sertraline here is very powerful. Other SSRIs and the SNRIs do not seem compellingly associated with MADD. The two Australian cases on SNRIs are counterbalanced by the three Swedish cases where other drugs used prior to sertraline did not cause MADD in the same individuals in whom sertraline did cause MADD. The North American case where two measurements off sertraline produced a fully normalized acylcarnitine profile in one individual while going back on sertraline caused it to resume its MADD-like state alongside five Swedish cases where going off sertraline all made an abnormal acylcarnitine profile normalize offers clearer evidence that this is causation rather than a simple correlation.\n\nThe fact that sertraline-induced MADD is 45 times more common than genetic MADD, that it is harder to fix, and that 30 cases were found almost immediately in four out of 197 countries while only about 600 total genetic cases worldwide have ever been reported suggests this is the tip of the iceberg and that this is a rare but powerful and dangerous effect of sertraline.\n\nIndeed, how many people with fatigue, weakness, and muscle pain even get an acylcarnitine profile tested?\n\nIf this only occurs in one in 5500 people, or even if it is 100 times more common than this and it is one out of 55 people, this still implies it is a genetic idiosyncrasy creating a predisposition for it to occur. Within some relatively uncommon genetic constraints, however, it becomes a predictable dose-dependent effect of sertraline.\n\nSeveral heterozygous mutations in the ETFDH system, riboflavin transport, or fatty acid oxidation had been potentially tied to some of these cases, but the defining feature of sertraline was that there was no basis for a classical genetic diagnosis involving two pathogenic mutations in the same enzyme, and even the Australian paper which cast the broadest net for genetic investigation could only find a single heterozygous mutation in three out of ten cases.\n\nThat doesn’t mean genetics aren’t involved. It suggests instead that a much broader net needs to be cast to find the relevant genetic predisposition.\n\nNot a single one of these papers mentioned hypoxia or the sigma-1 receptor, showing that pharmacology, psychiatry, and the specialists in inborn errors of metabolism are fully united in completely misunderstanding the role of serotonin in the body and the intracellular impacts of SSRIs.\n\nNone of these cases will ever be solved until these disciplines exit the intellectual stranglehold in which SSRIs are seen as “psychiatric drugs” rather than “mitochondrial drugs.”\n\nThe question arises whether this can be explained by any of the known effects of sertraline.\n\nThe increased mitochondrial biogenesis implied in the western Swedish paper is consistent with the ability of extracellular serotonin to activate this process, though it could also be a secondary compensation for poorly functioning mitochondria.\n\nThe observations about the respiratory chain patterns in the western Swedish and North American papers seem to conflict with one another or imply clinical heterogeneity, but they cannot be directly compared due to fundamental differences in methodology. Nevertheless, they are both consistent with variations of the hypoxia response, which is centrally impacted by SSRIs.\n\nSertraline stands out as a powerful sigma-1 activator, a close second to fluvoxamine. Unfortunately, no studies have directly compared the rate of sertraline and fluvoxamine uptake into cells. It could be that while fluvoxamine is a more powerful activator of the sigma-1 receptor, sertraline enters cells much better than fluvoxamine and that this is enough to more than make up for the gap.\n\nIn general, SSRIs that strongly activate the sigma-1 receptor are expected to be better for mitochondrial function than those that activate it poorly or trivially.\n\nHowever, there could be a genetic mutation found in these cases that fundamentally changes the importance of chronic sigma-1 activation. In fact, it could even alter the way sertraline binds to it without altering the way fluvoxamine binds to it. Since no one investigating this appreciates the importance of sigma-1 activation to sertraline’s impact on mitochondrial function, no one has looked at it.\n\nAlternatively, SSRIs differ in how they structurally interact with the serotonin transporter, so there could be a mutation that makes sertraline especially potent in blocking the entry of serotonin into the mitochondria where it is needed to synthesize melatonin. Or perhaps it even makes it less likely for sertraline to dissociate from the extracellular serotonin transporter and therefore enter the cell in the first place.\n\nIt is not clear to what degree the elevated acylcarnitines reflect the centrally causal event in metabolic dysfunction or reflect impaired mitochondrial respiration as centrally causal. As noted in the beginning, impairments in the respiratory chain can elevate acylcarnitines. While the western Swedish paper also found elevated fatty acid oxidation and suppressed ETF dehydrogenase, it can’t be ruled out that this is secondary to hypoxia response activation, which can have variable impacts on fatty acid oxidation depending on the intensity and duration of hypoxia.\n\nThus, there is much more to learn about this, but it appears specifically tied to sertraline, clearly indicated by broadly elevated acylcarnitines, and sometimes but not always responsive to riboflavin supplementation and sertraline discontinuation.\n\nSertraline discontinuation can be complicated by the fact that SSRI withdrawal can cause mitochondrial dysfunction. However, I suspect that this would not occur in the case of sertraline-induced MADD. Neither of my clients who suffered catastrophic effects from SSRI withdrawal had anything that looked like this phenomenon, despite one who was on sertraline for years, and while clinical improvement was reported for some but not all sertraline-induced MADD patients, none of the papers reported any problems during withdrawal.\n\nThe ideal way to address riboflavin would be to first measure blood levels. Especially if they are low, focus should be placed on getting more riboflavin from food. A “riboflavin flush” with a high dose for two weeks might be valuable as a way to fix the deficiency much faster, but it should be followed by going back to food-level riboflavin. Supplemental riboflavin can be titrated up from 6.5 milligrams to 37 milligrams to 100 milligrams using liquid riboflavin, the Thorne product, and a standard 100-milligram product. You can also take a 100-milligram capsule and weigh it out into four 25-milligram capsules using empty capsules and a milligram scale to give you more control over the dose. In such a titration you want to slowly find the minimum dose that is needed to produce the maximally effective result. Going higher than this should be safe in most cases but should only be done if increasing the dose continues to generate big dividends, or if lower doses do nothing and you are temporarily exploring whether higher doses might work. Your aim should be to titrate up to the point of diminishing returns and then stabilize there or slightly pull back to the dose that gave the most recent very large benefit. Starting with the “flush,” going back to baseline, and then engaging in a slow upward titration allows you to more precisely define the dose you need without being fooled by it taking months to fix a deficiency.\n\nThe indications in two of these papers that variants in the hypoxia response could be creating blocks in the respiratory chain raise the possibility that some of the patients who never improved on riboflavin and sertraline withdrawal may have needed to fix their respiratory chain.\n\nMy Mitome test uses an interpretive algorithm that I invented that detects these variants of the hypoxia response using pattern analysis of the respiratory chain enzyme activity and generates a protocol to address each variant. This test does not diagnose or treat disease, but it can help with biochemical optimization where such bottlenecks in energy production are suspected.\n\nWe have now seen that both SSRI use and SSRI withdrawal can cause mitochondrial dysfunction, with poorly understood genetic idiosyncrasies determining which of these outcomes any given person lands on.\n\nPlaying with SSRIs is playing with fire.\n\nThe risk is you set your mitochondria on fire.\n\nIn the next installment, we look at vastly superior approach to mental health that can avoid these catastrophic results altogether.\n\nThis Is 25x More Effective Than Antidepressants—And It's Not a Drug\n\nIn this article we will examine a potential treatment for depression that so far looks to be almost 25 times more effective than antidepressants and four times more effective than ketamine at creating long-term psychological resilience.\n\nSubtitle: Installment eight in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.\n\nDescription: Scientific expertise blended with out-of-the-box thinking for new practical ideas you can use to help yourself on your journey to vibrant health, by Chris Masterjohn, PhD.",

    "title": "SSRI Withdrawal Is Mitochondrial Dysfunction",
    "content": "In analyzing the biochemical data of clients over the last year I have worked on two cases involving catastrophic failures of energy metabolism that occurred in the wake of SSRI withdrawal. In both cases, switching SSRIs from one to another also seemed to play a role in precipitating energetic dysfunction.\n\nHere we will examine the concept that both SSRI withdrawal and SSRI switching can cause mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nThis is the seventh installment in our series on the truth about serotonin and SSRIs and builds on the information in the last installment, SSRIs Are Mitochondrial Drugs.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThe first individual had no issues being on Paxil long-term nor going off Paxil for the first time, but when he went on Paxil a second time he developed tachycardia and muscle cramps and spasms during sleep. Switching to Lexapro made these worse. Withdrawing from Lexapro then added to these problems a whole list of new problems: sexual dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, shortness of breath, anxiety, muscle cramping, numbness, and excessive urination.\n\nThe second individual developed sexual dysfunction on Zoloft and chronic fatigue in the wake of Zoloft withdrawal in his 20s. At its worst point, he spent a year not being able to stand in the shower and a month needing to be bathed by another person and needing a portable bedside toilet.\n\nDespite these problems onsetting during the withdrawal from Zoloft, Prozac immediately caused extreme spaciness and a low dose of Celexa caused restlessness. He is not confident that Zoloft would not have caused the same problems at that time because he felt hypersensitive to everything. However, the hypothesis that switching SSRIs did indeed worsen his situation should be considered, because SSRIs have different impacts on mitochondrial function.\n\nBoth people received individualized protocols based not on generalized information about SSRI withdrawal, but based on mitochondrial testing, whole genome sequencing, and comprehensive biochemical data.\n\nThe second just received his protocol so has no results to report yet.\n\nThe first received his protocol in November of last year. Despite “having gone to see dozens of specialists who could not tell me what was going on,” six weeks into his protocol he reported “the first time I felt normal in over two years.”\n\nAt the six-month mark, he wrote “six months later, I have regained quality of life and am able to do everything I used to be able to.”\n\nAfter 8.5 months, he wrote “I've still been pretty amazed how effective your protocol has been. On the whole I feel like a whole different person from a year ago. It's wild. I've also gained close to 15 pounds in lean muscle mass since January. Making gains in the gym daily and I think I can end the year with another 10 pounds of mass. Been crushing it at work and also traveling and feel comfortable in my body for the first time in 2-3 years. Excited to see what continued progress I can make!”\n\nThe Mitome results of the two individuals were very different. Importantly, neither of them had Mitome tested in the immediate wake of SSRI withdrawal, so in each case the results reflect the combination of genetics, nutritional status, and prior experience, including the catastrophic effects of SSRIs and being off them for several years. The first showed a pattern associated with deficient methylation expected to suppress the hypoxia response, while the second showed a pattern associated with the impact of an excessive hypoxia response.\n\nWhole genome sequencing suggested the first individual’s results were caused by a heterozygous defect in SLC25A26, which prevents methyl groups from being transported into the mitochondria, while the second individual’s results were caused by a heterozygous gain-of-function polymorphism in a receptor for TNF-alpha that creates a chronically increased inflammatory tone, which primes cells to easily activate a hypoxia response that suppresses mitochondrial respiration.\n\nThe second case is rather straightforward to explain: the hypoxia response is antagonized by sertraline (Zoloft) but exacerbated by fluoxetine (Prozac) and citalopram (Celexa). Thus, while the second individual remains deeply uncertain whether these different SSRIs had genuinely different impacts on him at the time they were tried, the response is consistent with the experimental evidence suggesting these different SSRIs have disparate impacts on the hypoxia response.\n\nThe first case is less straightforward to explain because paroxetine (Paxil) appeared to be harmless upon first use and withdrawal but the negative reaction to the second use implies that yo-yoing on paroxetine can be particularly harmful. This yo-yoing effect could be seen as a disorganized response to the conflicting positive and negative effects of paroxetine on mitochondrial function:\n\nParoxetine has the least activation of the sigma-1 receptor out of any SSRI, which suggests its ability to increase extracellular serotonin will lead to a high ratio of mitochondrial biogenesis to mitophagy, and this is consistent with rodent studies showing it increases markers of mitochondrial density.\n\nParoxetine has the least activation of the sigma-1 receptor out of any SSRI, which suggests its ability to increase extracellular serotonin will lead to a high ratio of mitochondrial biogenesis to mitophagy, and this is consistent with rodent studies showing it increases markers of mitochondrial density.\n\nWhile the hypoxia response usually opposes mitochondrial biogenesis, the unnatural level of extracellular serotonin achieved with SSRIs will activate both processes. Paroxetine’s lack of sigma-1 activation makes it deplete brain serotonin instead of increasing brain serotonin like the SSRIs that are powerful sigma-1 activators, which means it will increase the anti-respiration aspects of the hypoxia response without supporting the pro-respiration aspects mediated by intracellular serotonin and melatonin.\n\nWhile the hypoxia response usually opposes mitochondrial biogenesis, the unnatural level of extracellular serotonin achieved with SSRIs will activate both processes.

So, the initial experience of paroxetine may have been simply balancing out the hypoxia response in his particular case, while its promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis may have been quite useful.\n\nThis individual was probably hyper-tolerant of the hypoxia response promotion due to his idiosyncratic mitochondrial pattern expected to suppress that response. So, the initial experience of paroxetine may have been simply balancing out the hypoxia response in his particular case, while its promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis may have been quite useful.\n\nHowever, withdrawing from paroxetine could have caused a rebound decrease in mitochondrial density that created a greater vulnerability to the toxic actions of paroxetine that became evident upon reusing the drug. This could include the imbalanced hypoxia response, direct inhibition of mitochondrial serotonin receptors, and direct inhibition of respiratory chain complexes. While he may have initially tolerated the imbalanced hypoxia response, this tolerance could have been lost as a result of the rebound decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nHowever, withdrawing from paroxetine could have caused a rebound decrease in mitochondrial density that created a greater vulnerability to the toxic actions of paroxetine that became evident upon reusing the drug. This could include the imbalanced hypoxia response, direct inhibition of mitochondrial serotonin receptors, and direct inhibition of respiratory chain complexes. While he may have initially tolerated the imbalanced hypoxia response, this tolerance could have been lost as a result of the rebound decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nLexapro (escitalopram) shares with paroxetine (Paxil) the increase in extracellular serotonin and the promotion of respiration-impairing aspects of the hypoxia response. However, it is a ten times more powerful sigma-1 activator. It is nowhere near as powerful as fluovaxamine or sertraline, but it is much more powerful than paroxetine. This would be expected to balance mitochondrial biogenesis with mitophagy and to balance the hypoxia response with the preservation of respiration caused by intracellular serotonin and melatonin. However, it is also the most mitochondrially toxic of the SSRIs when compared head-to-head using isolated mitochondria. It is especially toxic toward complex IV compared to other SSRIs, and his complex IV was already hurt by his impairment in methyl group transport.\n\nIf the paroxetine yo-yoing effect was indeed caused by a rebound drop in mitochondrial density, then escitalopram’s stimulation of mitophagy via the sigma-1 receptor may have aggravated this with a further drop in mitochondrial density.\n\nOne thing we have to understand here is that, while the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis is ordinarily stimulated by an energetic deficit, which signals a need for more mitochondria, the actual process of building new mitochondria is incredibly energy-intensive. It is anabolic. It cannot occur without energy no matter what the regulation says should be happening.\n\nGiven all that, this is the likely sequence of events:\n\nThe yo-yoing of paroxetine caused a rebound drop in mitochondrial density after the first withdrawal that flipped the response to a second use in favor of vulnerability to its mitochondrial toxicity.\n\nThe yo-yoing of paroxetine caused a rebound drop in mitochondrial density after the first withdrawal that flipped the response to a second use in favor of vulnerability to its mitochondrial toxicity.\n\nThis then caused energetic dysfunction that prevented the second use of paroxetine from rebuilding the lost mitochondria.\n\nThis then caused energetic dysfunction that prevented the second use of paroxetine from rebuilding the lost mitochondria.\n\nThis then allowed the relative balance favoring of mitophagy by escitalopram to worsen this.\n\nThis then allowed the relative balance favoring of mitophagy by escitalopram to worsen this.\n\nThe lower mitochondrial content of tissues primed them to respond poorly to the higher mitochondrial toxicity of escitalopram.\n\nThe lower mitochondrial content of tissues primed them to respond poorly to the higher mitochondrial toxicity of escitalopram.\n\nThe astounding benefits he obtained from his protocol were NOT based on trying to fix the catastrophic destruction induced by SSRI use, withdrawal, and switching, but rather on a coherent theory of his biochemical idiosyncrasies at the time I worked on his case informed by insights into which were genetic in nature based on the analysis of his whole genome sequencing. The lion’s share of the benefits were deducible from Mitome alone, though whole genome sequencing and nutritional/biochemical analysis enhanced the interpretation.\n\nHow much of this is generalizable across SSRI withdrawal? Let’s take a look at the literature.\n\nSSRI Discontinuation Syndrome\n\nSSRI Discontinuation Syndrome\n\nPost-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction\n\nPost-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction\n\nProzac Withdrawal Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Mice\n\nProzac Withdrawal Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Mice\n\nNear Infrared Light Reverses Genital Anesthesia\n\nNear Infrared Light Reverses Genital Anesthesia\n\nMitochondrial Dysfunction Tanks Testosterone\n\nMitochondrial Dysfunction Tanks Testosterone\n\nMitochondrial Dysfunction Causes Neurological Dysfunction\n\nMitochondrial Dysfunction Causes Neurological Dysfunction\n\nHow Common Is Mitochondrial Dysfunction as a Mediator of SSRI\n\nHow Common Is Mitochondrial Dysfunction as a Mediator of SSRI\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome and PSSD?\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome and PSSD?\n\nSSRI discontinuation syndrome occurs in over half of people who stop SSRIs according to observational studies, and in about twenty percent of people in randomized controlled trials. Even using the smaller number from the trials, there are millions of people worldwide who are undergoing cessation of SSRIs at any given moment, suggesting there are always hundreds of thousands of people experiencing SSRI discontinuation syndrome in any given moment.\n\nThis can involve irritability, anxiety, mood problems, crying, dread, suicidal ideation, insomnia, nightmares, excessive dreaming, lethargy, fatigue, headache, tremor, sweating, anorexia, flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain, numbness, tingling, feeling like something is crawling on the skin, electric shocks running through the brain or body, rushing noises, visual traces (seeing something persist when it is no longer there, or seeing moving objects leaving illusory streaks of light behind them, etc), dizziness, light-headedness, vertigo, confusion, difficulty concentrating, amnesia, genital hypersensitivity, and premature ejaculation.\n\nThe sexual side effects of SSRI discontinuation are not considered to include the genital numbness and erectile dysfunction characteristic of post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD), but as we will consider below PSSD can indeed become a long-lasting SSRI side effect that doesn’t start until after SSRIs are stopped, meaning that a subset of PSSD is indeed a subset of SSRI discontinuation syndrome.\n\nSSRI discontinuation syndrome tends to require more than one week and perhaps six to eight weeks of SSRI treatment as a pre-requisite. It occurs more often in men than women, younger individuals than older, in those that stop SSRIs abruptly instead of tapering, and more often with Paxil (paroxetine) than Prozac (fluoxetine) or Lexapro (escitalopram). It can appear as early as 24 hours after the last dose, usually resolves in two to three weeks, but can last longer, even months or years.\n\nAnalysis of internet forums shows that “protracted withdrawal syndrome” can last anywhere from five months to almost fourteen years. The average person reporting such protraction of their discontinuation symptoms was using SSRIs for eight years prior to withdrawal.\n\nA survey of people in the UK-based National Health Services found that whether withdrawal problems occurred increased progressively as the length on the SSRI went up: 64% for those using them less than six months; 86% for those using them from 6 months two years; and 96% of those who had used them for more than two years.\n\n38% reported trying to stop but being unable to do so.\n\nThose reporting “severe” withdrawal symptoms were much more likely to have used SSRIs for a longer period of time: 7% of of those using them less than six months; 15% of those using them between six months and two years; and 25% of those using them for longer than two years.\n\nWithdrawal symptoms lasting longer than a year was reported by 7% of those who had been on SSRIs less than six months and 12% of those who had been on them for more than two years.\n\nThe most common “non-emotional” problems reported by the majority were headache, derealization, depersonalization, and lightheadedness. 28% reported “brain zaps,” 27% reported muscle cramps, 27% reported nausea or vomiting, 24% reported diarrhea, and 30% reported trouble walking stably.\n\nAn in-depth study of “brain zaps” where people were approached through forums on mentalhealthdaily.com found that the onset to the first zap was eight days with fluoxetine and two days with paroxetine, suggesting the big difference in half-life of these two drugs primarily led to a difference in how long it took to experience the zaps.\n\n52% said the “zaps” felt like an electric shock inside the head, 18% said it felt like a vibration, 12% said they could hear the zaps, 4% said they could see the zaps, 7% said it felt like a pop or a twitch, and a small number of people described it with such terms as a strobe without a light, a crackle, their brain skipping a beat or blinking, or as if the video of their mind was buffering.\n\nThe most common triggers of brain zaps were moving the eyes or the head from side to side.\n\nThe most up-to-date reviews mention NOTHING about mitochondria in their explanations of this syndrome. The common explanation for why Paxil has a higher prevalence of discontinuation syndrome is that is is much more rapidly cleared from the body. This is an extremely unsatisfactory explanation, however, because this should be easily solved with a more drawn-out tapering.\n\nThese reviews mention NOTHING about the sigma-1 receptor. In fact, the most recent review on the mechanisms of SSRI discontinuation syndrome is part of an anthology titled “Emerging Neurobiology of Antidepressant Treatments” and is written by one of the editors of the anthology yet the entire anthology is over 300 pages and does not mention sigma-1 receptors even once. Thus, there is no discussion of how Paxil stands out as the weakest activator of the sigma-1 receptor out of all SSRIs, ten times weaker than Lexapro and twenty times weaker than Prozac. This positions it as uniquely powerful in its ability to deplete total brain serotonin, making the sudden absence of its ability to sustain extracellular brain serotonin much harder to deal with.\n\nIn rats, fluoxetine produces an initial decrease in brain serotonin lasting one to three days, which then recovers to a slightly higher than baseline level thereafter. Withdrawing from fluoxetine causes a much larger initial drop in brain serotonin that takes seven days to recover from.\n\nThis is consistent with fluoxetine being a moderate sigma-1 activator. Initially, a higher extracellular serotonin concentration causes greater activation of serotonin receptors that exert negative feedback on serotonin synthesis. However, its activation of the sigma-1 receptor then causes a broad increase in intracellular serotonin synthesis. The rats then become dependent on the constant sigma-1 activation to counter the constant overactivation of serotonin receptors. When fluoxetine is withdrawn, the drop in sigma-1 activation causes a sudden drop in serotonin synthesis, but then the return to normal extracellular serotonin signaling allows this to even out.\n\nBy contrast, treatment of mice for twelve days with paroxetine causes a decrease in brain serotonin and withdrawal leads to a rebound above baseline at least as early as day 2. In some areas of the brain, the rebound is mild and increases further into day 5. In others, it is pronounced, and it levels off by day 5.\n\nThe authors of these studies use individual SSRIs as a representative of the drug class and then generalize about the discontinuation syndrome. This leads to fundamentally incoherent conclusions.\n\nFor example, the authors of the latter study — done by the same group that wrote the first-cited review, one of whom was an editor of the anthology — suggest that SSRI discontinuation syndrome is driven by rebound overactivation of the serotonin system.\n\nSeparately, they claim that paroxetine has a higher rate of discontinuation syndrome than fluoxetine because it leaves the body faster.\n\nIf the latter claim is true, paroxetine should do the same thing to brain serotonin during withdrawal as fluoxetine, but should do it faster. Yet they simply have opposite effects: equilibration to fluoxetine leads to a slightly higher brain serotonin level than baseline, and equilibration to paroxetine leads to a considerably lower level than baseline; discontinuation of fluoxetine leads to a big drop in brain serotonin and discontinuation of paroxetine leads to an increase.\n\nThis recent paper, like the more than 300-page anthology, makes no mention of sigma-1 receptors. Yet these receptors easily explain the results: fluoxetine maintains serotonin synthesis by activating this receptor and paroxetine fails to do so. Therefore, the negative effect on brain serotonin of activating the extracellular serotonin receptor dominates the effect of paroxetine, so serotonin goes down on the drug and up during withdrawal; the sigma-1 activation caused by fluoxetine is the slightly dominant effect, so serotonin goes slightly up on the drug and down during withdrawal.\n\nYet they are both associated with SSRI discontinuation syndrome, making rebound increases or decreases in serotonin poor explanations of the syndrome, at least in isolation and treating the syndrome as if it is a single pathological entity.\n\nAnother hypothesis to explain the higher rate of discontinuation syndrome with Paxil is that it has anticholinergic activity by binding to and inhibiting acetylcholine receptors, so its withdrawal will cause a rebound excess of acetylcholine activity. But this is a unique function of Paxil among the SSRIs and is similar to the older tricyclic antidepressants, whereas between 20% and a majority of all SSRI users get this syndrome, and the symptoms expected from a cholinergic rebound are limited to a relatively small portion of the discontinuation symptoms. So it could play a minor role in Paxil withdrawal but not an overall major role in the syndrome.\n\nPaxil also has modest inhibition of dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, so Paxil withdrawal could lower activity of these neurotransmitters, but the criticisms of the anticholinergic hypothesis also apply here.\n\nThe most up-to-date reviews admit this syndrome is poorly understood, and recommend tapering SSRIs, but also acknowledge that “present guidelines for managing SSRI discontinuation are based on dose tapering and not a knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying discontinuation.”\n\nIn making this statement, they also betray the fact that they are intellectually trapped into the belief that the mechanism is fundamentally “neural” when the answer lies in accepting that SSRIs are whole-body drugs acting primarily on cells that aren’t neurons, and that what they do to neurons and what they do to other cells fundamentally involves messing with serotonin and melatonin’s impact on mitochondria as well as the SSRIs themselves entering the cells and activating other receptors such as the sigma-1 receptor.\n\nPost-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction\n\nSexual dysfunction was at first recognized as occurring on SSRIs. Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD) was recognized after evidence accumulated that this sexual dysfunction could persist after discontinuing SSRIs. The most commonly reported problems in men are genital anesthesia (total loss of any feeling in the genitals), loss of sexual pleasure, weak orgasms, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and premature ejaculation.\n\nPSSD is often associated with general anhedonia, apathy, and poor mood.\n\nGenital anesthesia, and, in women, loss of sexual sensitivity in the nipples, are according to some reviews specific problems associated with PSSD that are not reported in other forms of sexual dysfunction. However, genital anesthesia also accompanies similar syndromes that endure after the use of finasteride, which inhibits the conversion of testosterone to the more potent DHT, and isotretinoin, a compound that mimics some aspects of vitamin A but otherwise acts as a vitamin A antagonist. The incidence of PSSD in SSRI users has been estimated to be 0.46%.\n\nResearchers and clinicians dealing with PSSD have speculated that genital anesthesia results from damaged spinal cord neurotransmission; that decreased libido results from impaired dopamine transmission in the brain; that erectile dysfunction could result from SSRIs altering the function of oxytocin or androgens; and that weak orgasms result from decreased oxytocin and beta-endorphin release. They have further speculated that multiple rather than single uses of SSRIs, preexisting disorders of glutamate neurotransmission, MTHFR variants, and abuse of recreational drugs could all increase the risk of PSSD.\n\nPSSD is consistently described in most reviews not as sexual dysfunction arising after the withdrawal of SSRIs, but rather sexual dysfunction arising often within days or weeks of starting SSRIs, occasionally within 30 minutes of the first dose, and either persisting or worsening after withdrawal of the medication. However, more broad-minded reviews see a more general syndrome associated mainly with use of SSRIs, isotretinoin, and finasteride, and possibly with non-SSRI neuropsychiatric drugs like buprenorphine, ondansetron, quetiapine, lithium, and haloperidol, and note that it can have its onset after the cessation of the drug. Most of the non-SSRI neuropsychiatric drugs had been co-prescribed with SSRIs, however, so the best high-level perspective is that this is a syndrome that can have its onset soon after the initial use, any time during the use, or after the cessation of SSRIs, finasteride, or isotretinoin. The syndrome can last for as little as weeks or months, but has been documented to last, in the longest case, for at least 18 years.\n\nEven very recent reviews have a nearly complete dearth of useful actionable information or genuine insights into the causation of these syndromes. Speculations about the mechanisms are at a level of proximate cause (for example, decreased neurotransmission through the spinal cord driving genital anesthesia), not ultimate cause, and therefore shed little light on what could be done about the problems. Reviews claim that most case reports fail to support any benefit of testosterone replacement therapy, PDE5 inhibitors, dopamine-boosting drugs, or any other drugs that have been tried.\n\nThere is, by contrast, support for the use of bupropion and PDE5 inhibitors from subjects with SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction who are still on SSRIs. This includes Viagra improving erectile dysfunction in a meta-analysis of multiple trials; a single, small, double-blind study using bupropion as an adjunct therapy for broader sexual dysfunction; and a small number of case reports using bupropion similarly. The bupropion trial selected only individuals who were presently using SSRIs and had been using them for at least three months. There was a 20% increase in the desire/frequency subscore of the sexual function test, but there was no statistically significant difference in the total score. Notably the baseline scores were 40 out of 70, where the cutoff for sexual dysfunction is 47 for males and 41 for females, indicating only mild sexual dysfunction.\n\nThe commonality of this syndrome across exposure to SSRIs, finasteride, and isotretinoin suggests these drugs could share a primary mechanism in common. Given the importance of testosterone to sexual function, one possibility is that they all do what finasteride is designed to do: lower the conversion of testosterone to DHT.\n\nIn one study, isotretinoin in the amount of 1 milligram per kilogram of bodyweight for 20 weeks lowered DHT in women but not men; in a second study, 0.75 mg/kg isotretinoin for twelve weeks lowered DHT by 21% in men, and the resulting ratios of metabolites suggested it inhibits 5-alpha-reductase just like finasteride does. However, in vitro, it has been shown to inhibit DHT production through an alternative pathway dependent on 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and no in vitro studies have examined whether it directly inhibits 5-alpha-reductase or decreases its expression.\n\nBizarrely, despite the existence of this syndrome and its establishment in the literature, there are no studies examining the effect of SSRIs on DHT.\n\nViagra prevents the breakdown of cGMP, a mediator of erections. cGMP synthesis is initiated by nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is also the mediatory of the parasympathetic branch of the sexual nervous system which mediates the totality of arousal. Several serotonin receptors are capable of increasing or decreasing nitric oxide synthesis. Sertraline and escitalopram have both been shown to decrease nitric oxide production. Therefore, SSRIs probably decrease nitric oxide production on average, and Viagra helps to counteract the effects of this on cGMP.\n\nBuproprion has complex actions but one is to increase the activity of dopamine and norepinephrine by inhibiting their reuptake from synapses, so this can easily explain its benefit to sexual function across the board.\n\nHowever, the fact that these drugs help does not necessarily tell us anything about the root cause of PSSD. Viagra will cause erections in any man, and buproprion improves sexual function even in women who that are not depressed and have never used SSRIs.\n\nProzac Withdrawal Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Mice\n\nThe only study I am aware of that looked at the impact of SSRI withdrawal on mitochondrial function was a study administering Prozac to rats. This one study appears to have generated several papers, including one on respiratory chain complexes and another on citrate synthase, which is a citric acid cycle enzyme that can serve as a useful but imperfect marker of mitochondrial density.\n\nThey administered a low and high dose for 28 days.\n\nTwo hours after the first dose, the Prozac increased complex I in the hippocampus. On day one, Prozac was beneficial.\n\nTwo hours after the last dose, 28 days later, Prozac had no effect at all. After a month, the benefit had worn off.\n\nTwenty-four hours after the last dose, however, the rats withdrawing from the high dose of Prozac had reduced complex II + III activity in the striatum and those withdrawing from both doses had reduced complex IV activity in the hippocampus. During withdrawal, the respiratory chain was harmed.\n\nOn day one, Prozac increased citrate synthase in the striatum. In the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex it seemed greater than in controls but it wasn’t statistically significant. Two hours after the last dose citrate synthase seemed lower in the striatum, but it wasn’t statistically significant. 24 hours after the last dose, citrate synthase appeared unchanged across the board. Overall there seemed to be a mild stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis that wore off over time.\n\nThe net result of this is that Prozac caused an acute improvement in mitochondrial function. Over time, the rats became dependent on it. They adjusted to the drug, and then after 24 hours of withdrawal they had new-onset mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nNear Infrared Light Reverses Genital Anesthesia\n\nAnother hint that SSRI withdrawal is mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction is a case report suggesting genital anesthesia can be reversed with near infrared light.\n\nOne case report showed that low-powered laser in the near infrared range on the scrotum and spine led to a 40% increase in penile sensitivity.\n\nNear infrared is obtainable from the sun as well as home devices like near infrared saunas or lamps. Infrared light acts in part by feeding photons to complex IV (cytochrome oxidase), which improves its ability to facilitate ATP production. Further, near infrared also structures mitochondrial water to improve its viscosity in a way that facilitates greater production of ATP by ATP synthase.\n\nMitochondrial Dysfunction Tanks Testosterone\n\nIn male rats, inhibiting complex I with the fish poison rotenone depletes testosterone.\n\nAccording to Chapter 10 of Saudubray, Inborn Metabolic Diseases: Diagnosis and Treatment, mitochondrial disorders can result in infertility and hypogonadism.\n\nThis can be explained through several mechanisms.\n\nFirst, the synthesis of testosterone is anabolic and therefore requires energy input. If you tank your energy production, you do not have energy to make testosterone.\n\nSecond, testosterone is itself anabolic. If you tank your energy production, you will tell your hypothalamus that you cannot afford to make testosterone, because if you do, you will increase your synthesis of muscle, which is extremely energetically expensive.\n\nWorse, you could wind up having sex.\n\nFor men, you could get someone pregnant, and then be responsible for spending precious energy providing for the anabolism of that new human and its future upbringing.\n\nFor women, you get get put on the hook for spending your energy on making an entirely new human and then feeding it milk for one to three years thereafter.\n\nTherefore, energetic deficiency makes it more difficult to make testosterone and makes the brain or sex organs restrain its production.\n\nMitochondrial Dysfunction Causes Neurological Dysfunction\n\nThe brain is only two percent of our bodyweight but consumes twenty percent of its oxygen.\n\nEnergy must be invested in the anabolic synthesis of myelin, neurotransmitters, and other brain materials and to maintain neurotransmitter function from each fraction of a second to the next.\n\nThe release of a neurotransmitter into a synapse, its action on the downstream neuron, its clearance from the synapse, the transmission of an action potential down the neuron, and the trigger for another neurotransmitter to be released at the other end all involves the exquisite control of a symphony of calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride, and potassium ions that are pumped to one side of a membrane and unleashed to flow back to the other side over and over again, where all the pumps are fueled by the energy contained within the ATP made by the neuronal mitochondria.\n\nAccording to Chapter 10 of Saudubray, Inborn Metabolic Diseases: Diagnosis and Treatment, mitochondrial disorders can result in the following problems reported during SSRI withdrawal: ataxia, cramps, and peripheral neruopathy.\n\nMuscle contraction occurs when sodium- and potassium-based neural signals cause calcium to be released at the end of a neuron, which causes acetylcholine to be released from the neuron onto the muscle, which then causes calcium to be released inside the muscle cell, which then signals the contraction. Muscle relaxation occurs when ATP puts the calcium back where it belongs. Magnesium is needed to support ATP, explaining the role of magnesium in muscle relaxation. If any of these ions are deficient or are not pumped where they are supposed to go using energy from ATP, you get cramps.\n\nAtaxia can occur from energetic failure in various parts of the nervous system or inner ear responsible for balance and coordination.\n\nThe causation of peripheral neuropathy has been reviewed here and here. It is a form of “ectopic signaling,” meaning signaling that is occurring in the wrong place. You can have a physical injury where sprouts of regenerating sensory receptors fire abnormally because they have lost normal connections, or because demyelinated nerves can bind together abnormally and fire abnormally, or can allow their signals to be discharged horizontally, propagating among a broader set of nerves than would normally be impacted.\n\nPhysical injury can be seen as a forceful undoing of the work of mitochondrial energy production. This energy is invested in creating order, and when its work is forcefully undone, relative chaos ensues.\n\nIf you have primary energetic failure, you get the same result: rather than a physical injury disrupting the work of mitochondrial energy production, the work cannot be done in the first place. Thus, disordered ion flows and neural connections produce ectopic signaling.\n\nThe specific abnormal sensations generated during ectopic signaling takes on flavors from the subconscious, from fears, or from the history of past sensations, which is why one person can experience pain and another tingling and another electric shocks.\n\nSome of the problems of SSRI withdrawal are more reminiscent of psychedelics than the common symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. For example, visual traces, being able to see or hear brain zaps, and hearing whooshing sounds that aren’t there.\n\nWhile electric shock-like pain is found in many disorders and can be seen as similar in its causation to peripheral neuropathy, “brain zaps” themselves appear to be a phenomenon relatively isolated to SSRI withdrawal.\n\nPsychedelics act on 5-HT2A receptors to induce psychedelic experiences, but serotonin does not normally induce these experiences even though it activates these receptors. Research suggests that this is because psychedelics but not serotonin indiscriminately enter the cell and bind to intracellular 5-HT2A receptors, located at least partly on the Golgi apparatus, and that they can stay activating these receptors for prolonged periods of time. By contrast, the areas of the brain involved in these perceptual modifications do not substantially express serotonin transporters outside those involved in reuptake of synaptic serotonin under normal conditions. Therefore, serotonin doesn’t usually enter these cells. However, if mice are engineered to highly express serotonin transporters in the relevant neurons the serotonin can enter the cell and it can induce these types of perceptual changes.\n\nAs covered in SSRIs are Mitochondrial Drugs, activation of the sigma-1 receptor increases expression of serotonin transporters in the cell membrane. These are normally activated under whole-body or cellular stress of multiple types. The natural ligands are unknown but may include DMT (the chemical from ayahuasca that we also make in small amounts endogenously), choline, sphingolipids, myristic acid, and DHEA-sulfate.\n\nIt is likely that in hypoxic stress, monamine oxidase activity declines and DMT rises, which would allow it to activate sigma-1 receptors. However, these conditions also facilitate the movement of serotonin into the mitochondria where it is converted to melatonin rather than acting as a persistent activator of Golgi 5-HT2A receptors. Further, the response is coordinated to normalize energy production under hypoxia as quickly as possible. Nevertheless, hypoxia probably sometimes activates these receptors to cause perceptual abnormalities, since some people can develop psychosis from altitude. Psychological stress, which activates sigma-1 receptors, is also a major contributor to psychotic breaks.\n\nThe question arises what on earth serotonin receptors are doing inside the cells of neurons that do not usually express serotonin transporters. Perhaps they are sitting there waiting for LSD or mushrooms to arrive. More likely, various forms of stress activate serotonin entry into the cell, where it does activate those receptors but not usually in a sustained and isolated way that facilitates a psychedelic trip.\n\nSSRI withdrawal could induce sustained activation of these receptors in a few ways we can brainstorm:\n\nChronic activation of the sigma-1 receptor may cause a long-lasting increase in serotonin transporters on the membranes of these neurons.\n\nChronic activation of the sigma-1 receptor may cause a long-lasting increase in serotonin transporters on the membranes of these neurons.\n\nChronic deprivation of intracellular serotonin in and of itself causes a long-term feedback loop increasing the serotonin transporter expression on these neurons, primarily to secure sufficient mitochondrial melatonin.\n\nChronic deprivation of intracellular serotonin in and of itself causes a long-term feedback loop increasing the serotonin transporter expression on these neurons, primarily to secure sufficient mitochondrial melatonin.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction in the wake of serotonin withdrawal leads to sigma-1 activation, increasing the serotonin transporters on the membranes of these neurons.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction in the wake of serotonin withdrawal leads to sigma-1 activation, increasing the serotonin transporters on the membranes of these neurons.\n\nThe relative specificity of this to SSRI withdrawal could simply result from a bias toward having greater impacts on certain parts of the brain with high concentrations of hypoxia response-promoting serotonin receptors.\n\nThe “brain zaps” being associated with side-to-side head and eye movements was suggested by the authors of that study to be related to activation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, whose job is to stabilize vision by making eye movements compensate for head movements.\n\nThis reflex is powerfully activated by serotonin, Prozac, and the “God molecule” psychedelic from toad venom, 5-methoxy-DMT. The commonality of these suggests it is mediated by activation of extracellular serotonin receptors.\n\nBrain zaps are probably a form of “ectopic signaling” that is very similar in nature to peripheral neuropathy, but is a result of specific disruptions to ion gradient maintenance in the neural circuitry of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Thus, the reflex activates with a lateral eye or head movement and then ions spill into the wrong places and initiate a perceptual abnormality.\n\nThis likely reflects mitochondrial dysfunction that has essentially gravitated to an area of the brain where extracellular serotonin is particularly important due to the long-standing use of a mitochondrial drug that is centrally involved in increasing extracellular serotonin.\n\nHow Common Is Mitochondrial Dysfunction as a Mediator of SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome and PSSD?\n\nWhile we cannot answer this with rigorous research, this is because serotonin is almost universally perceived as a “neural” and “psychiatric” molecule that modifies mood. Its central role in the hypoxia response and mitochondrial function and the direct impacts of SSRIs on intracellular sigma-1 receptors and the mitochondrial respiratory chain are entirely ignored in discussions about SSRI discontinuation syndrome.\n\nHowever, the fact that mainstream psychiatry and pharmacology has no real answers about this, especially for those suffering protracted withdrawal lasting years, indicates that we will learn a lot more when we think outside of these traditional constraints.\n\nDoing so leads to the conclusion that SSRI withdrawal is primarily a problem of mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nUnlike the one study on withdrawing from Prozac hurting the respiratory chain in mice, I do not know of any studies showing that switching from one SSRI to another causes mitochondrial dysfunction. But given that they have very disparate impacts on mitochondrial dysfunction, it is easy to see how this could happen, and the cases I wrote about at the beginning suggests that switching SSRIs over the course of withdrawal or after yo-yoing can play a role in the energetic dysfunction that develops.\n\nIn the next article, we will look at the ability of SSRIs themselves to cause mitochondrial dysfunction, and then we arrive at what can be done about it.\n\nYou can read the next article here:\n\nSSRIs Can Cause Severe Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nIn at least one out of 5,500 people – possibly at a much higher rate due to ignorance and underdiagnosis – sertraline (Zoloft) is such a potent mitochondrial poison that it can induce a devastating disease that has heretofore been thought to be a much rarer genetic disorder.\n\nSubtitle: Installment seven in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.\n\nDescription: Installment seven in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.",

    "title": "SSRIs are Mitochondrial Drugs",
    "content": "Our series has so far focused on serotonin and melatonin but now turns to SSRIs themselves. These not only interact with the ability of serotonin and melatonin to support mitochondrial function in both good and bad ways, but are themselves drugs that act on mitochondria both by activating receptors that have little to do with serotonin inside cells and by traveling to the mitochondria and having variable effects that are mostly toxic.\n\nSSRIs are called “selective” serotonin reuptake inhibitors because they inhibit serotonin transporters that bring serotonin into cells but do not meaningfully inhibit the transporters of other neurotransmitters like dopamine.\n\nThis name is grossly at odds with the name of serotonin itself, because the word “reuptake” implies that this is primarily relevant to synapses in the nervous system. Synapses are where one neuron meets another. The first neuron releases serotonin into the synapse where it can act on the second neuron. To ensure this activity does not last longer than it should, “reuptake” moves serotonin back into the first neuron so that it is no longer stimulating the second neuron. That is, it is taken back or taken up again in another event within a repeated cycle, so we call it re-uptake.\n\nBut serotonin is named after its presence in the blood and its action on smooth muscle cells where it stimulates contraction by acting directly on the serotonin receptors of the muscle cells. When these muscle cells contract, our blood vessels narrow, known as vasoconstriction.\n\nSerotonin travels into the cells that it acts on through the serotonin transporter, which is “uptake,” but not “reuptake.”\n\nSSRIs should be called uptake inhibitors, not reuptake inhibitors, because they inhibit the uptake of serotonin everywhere.\n\nAs pointed out in installment three, these transporters are found as abundantly in the gastrointestinal tract as in the brain, and are found at competitive abundance in the respiratory system and in male and female reproductive tissues. They are found at meaningful abundance in the liver and gall bladder, urinary system, pancreas, and urinary tissues, and they are not absent from any tissue.\n\nNeurons are minor expressers of the transporter. The cell types with the most expression are the enterocytes of the gut and the trophoblasts of the placenta. There is considerable expression by all sorts of glandular cells, skin cells, lung cells, sperm cells, heart muscle cells, smooth muscle cells, skeletal muscle cells, fat cells, connective tissue cells, immune cells, and blood cells that all rival the expression in neurons, many of which exceed the expression in neurons.\n\nSSRIs inhibit the uptake of serotonin into all of these cells, where the term “reuptake” has no application.\n\nThat these drugs are “selective” only applies to the relative reuptake of different neurotransmitters.\n\nThat is, they are not “selective” toward serotonin reuptake in the sense that they inhibit this more than they do completely unrelated things.\n\nNo, they are only “selective” toward this in that they don’t also inhibit the reuptake of other neurotransmitters like dopamine.\n\nMainstream medicine and pharmacology primarily view the significance of “off-target” effects of SSRIs as increasing extracellular serotonin in the gut where it activates 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors that can increase gastrointestinal upset, nausea, and vomiting, and negative feedback inhibition of serotonin release causing a two-week lag in the antidepressant effect.\n\nMainstream medicine and pharmacology primarily view the differences between SSRIs as a matter of their different strength in inhibiting serotonin transporters, which can cause differences in the dose required or the speed of therapeutic action.\n\nHowever, SSRIs travel into the cell such that the free concentration inside cells will always equilibrate with the free concentration outside cells. Some travel into cells much more than others, which makes the excess accumulate in cell membranes. SSRIs can be classed as strong, moderate, or weak activators of the sigma-1 receptor, which has powerful impacts on psychiatric responses that are mediated in large part by its direct impacts on mitochondrial function. From there, SSRIs are then free to have their own direct impacts on mitochondria.\n\nThe Serotonin System Is Hard to Hack With SSRIs\n\nThe mainstream pharmacological paradigm led to various efforts to try to better hack the serotonin system that never quite solved the problems of eliminating nausea or the initial delay in therapeutic activity.\n\nFrom the 1990s, it was a holy grail of SSRI development to find a way to inhibit the serotonin transporter while directly inhibiting the 5-HT1A receptors on the presynaptic neuron while stimulating the 5-HT1A receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. This would increase synaptic serotonin and abolish the negative feedback against serotonin release on the presynaptic neuron, all without antagonizing the impact of serotonin in regulating aggression, anxiety, addiction, appetite, memory, mood, pain perception, sleep, and body heat all mediated by the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. In theory, this would abolish the initial delay in therapeutic efficacy without causing psychiatric harm.\n\nThis, of course, was a laughable pipe dream. The main tool in Pharma’s kit was to play around with the ratio of serotonin transport inhibition to 5-HT1A inhibition or activation, but this does nothing to distinguish between presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors.\n\nThis effort spawned vilazodone (Viibryd), which is considered a serotonin modulator but not an SSRI. It inhibits serotonin transport and acts as a partial 5-HT1A activator, and the main effect was that it is much worse than SSRIs in producing nausea and so has to be titrated up to the effective dose much more carefully.\n\nIt also spawned vortioxetine (Trintillex). This also is not an SSRI. It inhibits serotonin transport, inhibits three of the fifteen serotonin receptors, partially activates one serotonin receptor, fully activates another, and increases signaling activity of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, glutamate, and GABA. It has a lower rate of side effects than SSRIs, especially with regard to sexual dysfunction and sleep disruption, but it still causes transient nausea in over 20% of users, a withdrawal rate of 8% over the course of a year due to adverse effects, and a long-term incidence of sexual dysfunction in over 1% of users.\n\nLitoxetine was supposed to be an SSRI that inhibits 5-HT3 receptors and for that reason has anti-nausea instead of pro-nausea effects. However, it was withdrawn from the approval process in the 1990s for undisclosed reasons and is now being reconsidered in France, Poland, and the UK as a drug for urinary incontinence. We do not know why it was never fully pursued for depression, but perhaps this is related to the role of 5-HT3 receptors in the nervous system where they regulate cognitive function, emotions, appetite, and pain perception, or their occurrence in the mitochondrial membrane where they preserve respiratory chain function during hypoxia.\n\nAnother strategy was to use SSRIs alongside pindolol, which inhibits beta-adrenergic receptors as well as 5-HT1A receptors. A handful of trials led to inconclusive results. In general it appeared to not be effective, but a small study suggested this might be because the doses used were not high enough. People complained of tiredness, nausea, vomiting, itching, postural hypotension, sweating, dry mouth, and mild transient dizziness, but it did not seem to change the safety profile compared to SSRIs alone.\n\nWhat these largely failed efforts to be more pharmacologically precise betray is that Pharma cannot be precise. Your natural physiology is incredibly precise, but Pharma works at the inferior level of biochemistry and molecular biology. It can make a drug interact with a receptor, and it can try to add some specificity to the destination of the drug by varying the mode of administration, but it can’t make it travel to one particular part of the brain and act on one receptor on one side of a synapse and do the complete opposite on the other side of the synapse.\n\nBy contrast, your body makes fifteen different serotonin receptors and has them combine with each other and with many other types of receptors in ways science has barely begun to understand to diversify their functions so that it can, in its inborn wisdom, make serotonin do different things in different places at different times in different contexts. When you give your body what it needs to nourish itself, you work with this complex physiology instead of trying to control it using tools that are wholly unfit for the job.\n\nIf you want to “hack” this physiology you should be doing it with different holistic stimuli, such as exercise, altitude, hypoxia, hyperoxia, eating, fasting, breathwork, and so on. These stimulate your body to use its own complex physiology to meet the challenge provided by the stimulus. It allows our relatively ignorant minds to focus on the simplicity of the stimulus while our incomprehensibly intelligent bodies respond with their own incredible complexity. We will cover these alternatives at the end of the series.\n\nFirst, we must sort out the powerful and consuming mitochondrial fire that SSRI prescribers are ignorantly playing with.\n\nSSRIs Have Different Effects on Intracellular Serotonin\n\nSSRIs Have Different Effects on Intracellular Serotonin\n\nSome SSRIs Inhibit Some Serotonin Receptors\n\nSome SSRIs Inhibit Some Serotonin Receptors\n\nSSRIs Impact Mitochondria by Activating the Sigma-1 Receptor\n\nSSRIs Impact Mitochondria by Activating the Sigma-1 Receptor\n\nEffect of SSRIs on Respiratory Chain Activity\n\nEffect of SSRIs on Respiratory Chain Activity\n\nHow Does Prozac Act As a Performance-Enhancing Drug?\n\nHow Does Prozac Act As a Performance-Enhancing Drug?\n\nNot All SSRIs Are the Same\n\nNot All SSRIs Are the Same\n\nSo What Does This Say About SSRI Withdrawal?\n\nSo What Does This Say About SSRI Withdrawal?\n\nSSRI Brand and Generic Names\n\nIn this article I will use the generic names of the SSRIs since these are used in the literature. However, you may be mostly familiar with the brand names. Here is a quick guide to their interconversions:\n\nProzac — fluoxetine\nCelexa (citalopram), a 50/50 mix of escitalopram (also sold separately as Lexapro) and its less effective mirror image isomer\nZoloft — sertraline\nLuvox — fluvoxamine\nPaxil — paroxetine\n\nSSRIs Massively Deplete Circulating Serotonin\n\nWe should expect SSRIs in principle to prevent serotonin from entering cells, which should lower intracellular serotonin and thereby inhibit the beneficial impact of serotonin and melatonin on mitochondrial function during hypoxia.\n\nThis should also deplete circulating serotonin.\n\nIndeed, a human cross-sectional study showed that 64 long-term users of citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine or sertraline all pooled together had 14-fold lower platelet serotonin than 64 matched controls. However, the different SSRIs were not reported separately. The scatterplot of platelet serotonin shows one individual with a serotonin level comparable to controls, and the only SSRI represented by a single person is fluvoxamine, raising the possibility that fluvoxamine has a divergent effect.\n\nA two-week double-blind study of paroxetine suggested this effect is achieved within 18 days and is driven largely by serotonin being excreted in the urine instead of accumulating in platelets. However, this effect on circulating serotonin might not be very relevant to the tissues that synthesize serotonin locally.\n\nThe working model of whole-body serotonin metabolism is that serotonin is primarily made in the gut, is stored in platelets, and is metabolized to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the liver and lungs. Meanwhile, brain serotonin is synthesized in the brainstem and has its metabolism compartmentalized in the brain. 5-HIAA from the brain, liver, lungs, or anywhere else then leaves the body in the urine.\n\nSSRIs appear to be draining serotonin from the blood into the urine instead of allowing circulating serotonin to be stored in platelets.\n\nThe lungs synthesize serotonin themselves, but also pick it up from circulating platelets and perhaps the neuroepithelial bodies that sense hypoxia could receive some traveling up the vagus nerve from the gut. Many other tissues outside the brain, however, probably get exposed to serotonin primarily when systemic hypoxia causes its release from platelets. This systemic hypoxia response should therefore be massively impaired in SSRI users.\n\nThere seems to be no exploration of this possibility in the literature, but it is notable that airplane travel is a form of hypoxic stress, and SSRI use in pilots has been implicated in airplane crashes, though with no ability to identify them as having caused the crashes.\n\nSSRIs Have Different Effects on Intracellular Serotonin\n\nIt would seem that SSRIs should lower intracellular serotonin in every cell type, since they inhibit the import of serotonin into the cell.\n\nHowever, this could hypothetically lead to a release of negative feedback against serotonin synthesis within that cell that then compensates for this.\n\nFurther, SSRIs are not selective to inhibition of serotonin transport when compared to other unrelated effects inside the cell. So SSRIs could be independently increasing serotonin synthesis once inside the cell.\n\nThe studies we have on how SSRIs impact intracellular serotonin are weak and inadequate, because they are limited to relatively short animal studies where individual SSRIs have been assessed for very different lengths of time in the different studies.\n\nWhat these studies suggest, though, is that citalopram and paroxetine may lower serotonin synthesis, while sertraline may raise it.\n\n21-day citalopram treatment of rats dramatically lowered total brain serotonin.\n\nIn mouse forebrain, citalopram decreased serotonin synthesis substantially within two days; this effect remained strong through 28 days, but was mitigated by decreased serotonin oxidation, causing total serotonin levels to only be slightly and not statistically significantly lower.\n\nRats treated for three days with paroxetine had brain serotonin synthesis nearly cut in half.\n\nSertraline treatment of leukemia cells in vitro lowers intracellular serotonin over the course of 48 hours due to uptake inhibition, but raises intracellular serotonin above baseline by 96 hours due to increased expression of tryptophan hydroxylase, the first enzyme involved in serotonin synthesis. Two-week treatment of rats with sertraline also raises the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase in the raphe nucleus of the brainstem as well. Fluoxetine also activated the enzyme in this experiment but was not studied in as much detail.\n\nWe will soon see that the general pattern emerging from this weak and inadequate spattering of animal research actually lines up perfectly with the relative strength with which these SSRIs activate the sigma-1 receptor.\n\nSome SSRIs Inhibit Some Serotonin Receptors\n\nFluoxetine binds to 5-HT2C receptors, which various studies have suggested inhibits or activates them, while citalopram does so much more weakly and paroxetine has no effect.\n\nFluoxetine also inhibits 5-HT2A receptors, which could hypothetically antagonize their promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nIn guinea pigs, both paroxetine and fluoxetine inhibit the ability of 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors in the gut to stimulate intestinal contractions, but fluoxetine is far more potent; neither have much inhibitory power toward 5-HT4 receptors in the brain but both inhibit 5-HT3 receptors in both the brain and the gut. Separately, it was shown that escitalopram inhibits 5-HT3 receptors in neuronal cancer cells. Nevertheless, if serotonin is sufficiently elevated to cause vomiting via 5-HT3 receptors, even fluoxetine does not inhibit them strongly enough to overcome its suppression of serotonin reuptake and the resulting increase in serotonin activation of the receptors. This was demonstrated in ferrets, in a study where the cancer drug cisplatin caused vomiting and fluoxetine worsened it.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 are the receptors known to be present on the inner mitochondrial membrane and necessary for protection of mitochondrial respiration during hypoxia raises the question of whether fluoxetine or paroxetine enter cells sufficiently to block the receptors on the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nA head-to-head comparison of fluoxetine and escitalopram showed that for both drugs, the intracellular free concentration rapidly becomes equal to the extracellular concentration. However, most of the drug becomes concentrated in intracellular membranes. When the membrane-bound drug is considered, fluoxetine enters cells ten times more effectively than escitalopram, being enriched in membranes 180-fold rather than 18-fold. A separate study showed that fluoxetine was taken up to a four-fold greater extent than fluvoxamine. In general it appears that SSRIs enter cells very effectively, with fluoxetine>fluvoxamine>escitalopram and where the others fit within that hierarchy being currently unclear.\n\nSince fluoxetine is most effective at entering cells and at inhibiting 5-HT3 receptors, fluoxetine would seem to be particularly likely to interfere with the protective effects of serotonin and melatonin during hypoxia.\n\nHowever, all SSRIs studied enter cells very effectively and some degree of 5-HT3 inhibition is shared across at least paroxetine, fluoxetine, and escitalopram.\n\nSSRIs Impact Mitochondria by Activating the Sigma-1 Receptor\n\nOnce SSRIs enter cells, they activate the sigma-1 receptor, but with extreme differences in potency.\n\nThe sigma-1 receptor is embedded in segments of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane that lie in close proximity to mitochondria, where it is connected to a binding protein that can release it during stress-induced activation. It causes release of calcium into mitochondria, which activates many processes involved in energy metabolism, and it travels to the plasma membrane, where it can facilitate other forms of cell signaling.\n\nIts natural function is poorly understood. However, the natural compounds that interact with it include DHEA sulfate, an activator, and pregnenolone, an inhibitor.\n\nOther natural compounds that bind to it include choline, certain fatty substances such as sphingolipids and myristic acid, and the endogenous hallucinogen N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which is also the main ingredient of ayahuasca.\n\nNotably, DMT is synthesized from tryptophan like melatonin and serotonin, and, like serotonin, rapidly broken down by monoamine oxidase. Since monoamine oxidase requires oxygen, DMT concentrations likely rise in hypoxia and activate the sigma-1 receptor.\n\nIn rodents, the sigma-1 receptor is responsible for sensitivity to the glucocorticoid receptor during stress induced by restraining the animal, and its absence leads to a depressive phenotype with a chronically overactivated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\n\nHowever, rodents lacking this receptor are also less likely to despair when battling humans who are restraining them, and they maintain a more robust preference for sugar than their normal counterparts, which is considered an experiment sign of the ability to enjoy pleasure.\n\nThey have higher brain and plasma serotonin and higher plasma histamine, suggesting that activation of the sigma-1 receptor lowers the synthesis or increases the degradation of histamine and serotonin.\n\nThe sigma-1 receptor is necessary for autophagy, which at the mitochondrial level makes it important for mitophagy, the clearance of damaged mitochondria, which prevents mitochondrial damage from causing cellular death.\n\nIt also has specific effects on mitochondrial metabolism. It strongly increases complex I activity, which causes a mild increase in reactive oxygen species that elicits the activation of protective antioxidant pathways. It increases the activity of the other respiratory chain complexes but the impact is much more mild. Its activation of calcium entry into the mitochondria likely causes increases in the activities of pyruvate, isocitrate, and malate dehydrogenases, which increase the production of NADH that is oxidized by complex I. Mitochondrial metabolism that begins with complex I leads to the synthesis of 40% more ATP than metabolism that begins later in the respiratory chain, so the likely impact of sigma-1 receptor activation is a large increase in the most efficient means of producing ATP in response to energy-demanding stressors.\n\nActivation of the sigma-1 receptor also protects against hypoxia. For example, in human neurons and immune cells, DMT dramatically improved cell survival during oxygen deprivation and prevented the rise in HIF activation, and this was blocked by impairing the sigma-1 receptor.\n\nIn live rats with their cerebral blood supply cut off, DMT maintains the ATP-dependent pumping of ions needed to maintain normal neurological function. The mechanism of the protective effect was not shown in these papers, but it is reminiscent of the effect of melatonin: it decreases activation of the hypoxia response while promoting cell survival and ATP-dependent functions, suggesting it is somehow enabling the paradoxical use of the respiratory chain to make ATP in the absence of oxygen.\n\nConsistent with this, in neurons from the retina of rats, the synthetic opioid pentazocine, which activates sigma-1 receptors, preserved the ability of the respiratory chain to pump protons during deprivation from glucose and oxygen. It also increased complex IV activity and at least one protein involved in transport of substances across the mitochondrial membrane.\n\nAgain this is consistent with the effects of serotonin and melatonin. As in our discussion of their impacts, however, there is clearly a missing piece of the puzzle. Complex IV being more active in an in vitro assay does not explain how it is facilitating respiratory chain activity within the cell during exposure to hypoxia, as complex IV requires oxygen to do anything.\n\nIn mice, tightly tying up a nerve with a suture activates the sigma-1 receptor, and this increases the expression of the serotonin transporter as well as tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme involved in intracellular serotonin synthesis. Thus, the sigma-1 receptor probably protects against hypoxia by brining serotonin into the cell, synthesizing even more serotonin within the cell, and allow the serotonin to be converted to melatonin inside the mitochondria. The melatonin could then substitute for oxygen as described in the last installment.\n\nI suspect that the sigma-1 receptor also increases the expression or activity of the mitochondrial enzymes that convert serotonin to melatonin, but this has not been studied. It is interesting that methylation is needed to get rid of histamine and to convert serotonin to melatonin. The rise in histamine and serotonin in mice lacking the sigma-1 receptor could reflect impairment in both of these processes.\n\nThe order of potency of SSRI activation of sigma-1 receptors is fluvoxamine>sertraline>fluoxetine>escitalopram>citalopram>paroxetine. Fluvoxamine and sertraline are relatively similar in their potency, and citalopram and escitalopram are quite close to one another, whereas fluoxetine is half that of sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram are about half that of fluoxetine, and paroxetine is almost ten times less potent than citalopram and escitalopram. The gap between the most potent (fluvoxamine) and the least potent (paroxetine) is 52-fold. Thus, the differences are extreme, and we can summarize them by saying paroxetine is so trivial as to be irrelevant, while the potent activators are fluvoxamine and sertraline, and the others are relatively weak activators.\n\nIf we compare this order of activation to the sporadic and inadequate animal studies cited above suggesting that citalopram and paroxetine may lower serotonin synthesis while sertraline may raise it, we can see this lines up perfectly with sertraline being a strong activator of the sigma-1 receptor, citalopram being weak, and paroxetine being trivial.\n\nThus, it is likely that the general effect of SSRIs as a class is to inhibit serotonin synthesis by increasing serotonin activation of extracellular serotonin receptors and thereby stimulating negative feedback mechanisms, while the effects of specific SSRIs are determined by the degree to which they activate the sigma-1 receptor. Strong activation will cancel out the impairment of the serotonin receptor by increasing the expression of the receptor and add on top of this an increase in intracellular serotonin synthesis.\n\nA question arises whether chronic, sustained activation of the sigma-1 receptor with a drug is good or bad for mitochondria. On the one hand, clearing away damaged mitochondria is an unambiguously good thing. However, could it oppose mitochondrial biogenesis to the point that it decreases mitochondrial density over the long-term? As I covered in my article, “Is Urolithin A the Ultimate Longevity Supplement?” it is possible that promoting mitophagy may itself lead to subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis. This is supported by studies with the mitophagy activator urolithin A in worms, where on day one they have decreased mitochondria and their ATP is cut in half, but their mitochondrial density recovers by day 8. It also has vague support from human trials, where there is low-quality evidence suggesting increased mitochondrial biogenesis. However, the regulation of these pathways is not understood well enough to predict whether everything that promotes mitophagy will necessarily promote mitochondrial biogenesis over the long-term, and there are no studies addressing this question with chronic use of pharmacological sigma-1 receptor activators.\n\nEffect of SSRIs on Respiratory Chain Activity\n\nOnce SSRIs enter cells they can also directly interact with mitochondria, either by acting on mitochondrial receptors and mitochondrial serotonin transporters, or by entering the mitochondria and impacting mitochondrial enzymes.\n\nA 2023 study in pig brain mitochondria showed that escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline were all powerful inhibitors of complex I; complex II + III activity was more moderately inhibited by paroxetine and sertraline and barely inhibited by escitalopram and fluvoxamine; complex IV was most powerfully inhibited by escitalopram, somewhat less inhibited by sertraline, even less inhibited by paroxetine, and barely inhibited by fluvoxamine. Complexes II and III were not measured on their own, so it isn’t clear whether impacts on the complex II + III measurement reflect complex II, complex III, or the CoQ10 that carries electrons between them.\n\nIn this head-to-head comparison, the SSRIs are equally bad when it comes to complex I, while escitalopram seems especially bad when it comes to complex IV.\n\nWhile that study did not include citalopram or fluoxetine, earlier studies by the same group using the same model showed that citalopram inhibits complex I the most, complex II to a lesser degree, and has no impact on complex IV; and fluoxetine is a powerful inhibitor of complex I with little to no impact on any other complexes.\n\nFurther, fluoxetine directly inhibits ATP synthase and accumulates in the mitochondrial membrane where it acts as an uncoupler, which means it causes energy to be lost as heat instead of being used to synthesize ATP. These effects have not been studied for other SSRIs.\n\nWith all that said, isolated mitochondria unfortunately strip away the complex effects serotonin would be expected to have at the plasma membrane and that SSRIs would have on the sigma-1 receptor and make everything come down to their impacts on mitochondrial membrane receptors and a possible impact on the transport of serotonin into the mitochondria.\n\nWe therefore now turn to in vivo animal experiments.\n\nIn rats, one study showed that paroxetine treatment increases activity of respiratory chain complexes in certain parts of the brain, but it did not normalize them to citrate synthase activity, which was also increased. Citrate synthase can be used as an imperfect marker of mitochondrial density, so the parallel increase in citrate synthase and respiratory chain enzymes suggests the major impact was an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. This casts the respiratory chain data in a less favorable light: complex I was increased in most regions, complex II in fewer regions, complex IV in only one region. This suggests complex II and especially complex IV lagged behind the overall stimulus for mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nThe paroxetine was 10 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight by injection. Injection is often used in rodent studies to avoid issues with rodents disliking the taste and refusing intake and to get around variation in the rate of absorption. This is the equivalent of a human taking 1.6 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight. Paroxetine is generally not given to children and given to adults in oral doses of 10-62.5 milligrams per day. For a woman weighing 50 kilograms, this would be 0.2-1.25 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight. Due to clearance by the liver when taken orally, injection is probably twice as potent as oral dosing, making the rat dose the equivalent of 3.2 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight for such a woman. Overall, the dose is roughly around the equivalent of someone with below-average bodyweight taking a maximal dose.\n\nIn rats, oral administration of 10 or 20 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight sertraline per day for 21 days mitigated the impairment of complex I otherwise caused by the fish poison rotenone, and 10 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight for 14 days protected against the impairment of complexes I, II, and IV by the fungal toxin 3-nitropropionic acid. Since rotenone is a specific inhibitor of complex I, the best explanation for sertraline reversing this is its potent activation of the sigma-1 receptor, which increases complex I activity. The protective effect against the fungal toxin was nullified by nitric oxide donors and synergized with antagonists of nitric oxide production, suggesting that sertraline helped reduce nitric oxide accumulation. Various studies have shown that sertraline has no effect, or decreases nitric oxide, and the decrease in nitric oxide may be mediated by increasing extracellular serotonin’s activation of 5-HT1A receptors.\n\nThe sertraline doses are the human equivalent of 1.6-3.2 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight Humans six years old and older are generally given 20-200 milligrams per day of sertraline, which is 0.92 to 9.2 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight for a 48-pound 6-year-old female and 0.28-2.8 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight for a 154-pound adult. Thus, the sertraline doses used in rats line up well with therapeutic doses used in humans.\n\nThe one study on fluvoxamine produced results that were inconsistent across doses and brain regions. The general tendency was for succinate dehydrogenase and complex II (two ways of measuring the same thing) to increase or do nothing, but for the other respiratory chain complexes and citrate synthase to decrease or do nothing. However, the middle dose diverged from this pattern in the prefrontal cortex, where it increased citrate synthase and complex I.\n\nThe overall pattern of decreased citrate synthase would be consistent with fluvoxamine activating the sigma-1 receptor to promote mitophagy, leading to destruction of damaged mitochondria and decreased mitochondrial density.\n\nThe fact that paroxetine and fluvoxamine appear to have completely opposite effects on mitochondrial density is consistent with the fact that fluvoxamine is the most potent SSRI activator of the sigma-1 receptor, which promotes mitophagy, whereas paroxetine has essentially no potency against this receptor, but will increase extracellular serotonin and its activation of mitochondrial biogenesis through 5-HT2A and 2B receptors.\n\nWhy complex II/succinate dehydrogenase was increased is unclear, but it could be related to this being the only mitochondrial respiratory chain complex whose subunits are encoded entirely by the nuclear genome. For example, the decrease in mitochondrial density could have hurt the rate of mitochondrial protein translation, while complex II could be made entirely with nuclear protein translation, and could therefore be the complex most easy to replace.\n\nThis raises a very important question: should we expect the potent sigma-1 receptor activators, fluvoxamine and sertraline, to lead to a permanent decline in mitochondrial density, or should we expect the long-term effect to be a bounce-back with healthier mitochondria?\n\nThe answer is not clear at all and demands further study.\n\nThe fluvoxamine study injected the rats for two weeks with 10, 30, or 60 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight, which is the equivalent of a human being taking 1.6, 3.2, or 4.9 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight, though injection may make them closer to the equivalents of 3.2, 6.4, or 9.8 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight. Doses in humans are 25-300 milligrams per day orally for both adults and children. For an 8-year-old female weighing 56 pounds, this would be 1-12 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight, so the doses in rats line up with what children and adolescents might be given.\n\nOf the two in vivo studies with escitalopram, the first showed that, on its own, it has no effect on complex IV or citrate synthase, but hurts activities of complexes I and II and the flow of electrons from complex II to complex III in some brain regions but not others. The second showed that on its own it had no impact on any of these parameters overall in the brain, but when combined with the fungal toxin 3-nitropropionic acid, it dose-dependently rescued the deficits in complexes I, II, and IV otherwise caused by the toxin.\n\nThe second study did not look at separate brain regions; it simply removed the cerebellum and homogenized the rest of the brain. The first study found that the greatest negative effect on complex I was in the cerebellum, with the striatum and hippocampus being next in line, whereas there was little to no effect in the cortex. The cortex makes up just under half of a rat’s brain after removing the cerebellum, whereas the other structures investigated in the first study only represent about 15% of the brain. Thus, the second study may have failed to uncover harms of escitalopram in specific areas of the brain because they were diluted by the overwhelming dominance of the cortex, where it has no effect on its own but appears to protect against at least one mitochondrial toxin.\n\nA separate study on sertraline protection against 3-nitropropionic acid toxicity suggested this toxin raises nitric oxide levels and sertraline protects against it by blunting this rise. Escitalopram has been shown to reduce nitric oxide levels, which has been shown to mediate erectile dysfunction and reduced anxiety, while some studies indicate its impact on nitric oxide production in the brain could be up or down depending on the brain region. Since some extracellular serotonin receptors increase nitric oxide and others decrease nitric oxide, and since some activate production of reactive oxygen species that could scavenge nitric oxide, it is likely this protective effect is tissue-specific, brain region-specific, and mediated by serotonin action on these extracellular receptors.\n\nOn the other hand, escitalopram may be directly hurting complexes I and II in certain brain regions, and this could be related to a mix of direct negative impacts on mitochondria in combination with biasing serotonin toward extracellular receptors that can activate the hypoxia response and away from protective intracellular roles of serotonin and melatonin on respiratory chain function during the hypoxia response.\n\nEscitalopram stands out as entering cells at a lower rate than fluvoxamine and fluoxetine and being a relatively weak activator of the sigma-1 receptor, though nowhere near as weak as paroxetine.\n\nThese studies used 10-20 milligrams per kilogram of escitalopram, which is the equivalent of a human taking 1.6-3.2 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight, though injection may make it closer to 3.2-6.4 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight. Escitalopram is usually used in doses of 5-20 milligrams per day in both adults and children. For an 8-year-old female weighing 56 pounds this would be 0.2-0.8 milligrams per kilogram body weight, so these doses of escitalopram are a bit higher than what pretty much anyone would be given, but are within an order of magnitude.\n\nFluoxetine is the most studied out of any of the SSRIs. The in vivo fluoxetine studies found the following:\n\nFor the respiratory chain in rats, acutely 10 milligrams per kilogram had no effect but 25 milligrams per kilogram increased complex I activity in the hippocampus but not in other regions measured; it had no effect after 28 days when examined two hours after the last dose; however, after 24 hours after the last dose, the high dose reduced complex II + III activity in the striatum and both doses reduced complex IV activity in the hippocampus, with no effects in other regions. In a different publication but likely the same study, there was no effect on citrate synthase. Overall the increased complex I could reflect acute activation of the sigma-1 receptor, and the emergence of decreased respiratory chain activity after 24 but not 2 hours suggests the cell had become dependent on increased intracellular serotonin synthesis from chronic sigma-1 activation, which then hurt the respiratory chain activity when it was withdrawn.\n\nFor the respiratory chain in rats, acutely 10 milligrams per kilogram had no effect but 25 milligrams per kilogram increased complex I activity in the hippocampus but not in other regions measured; it had no effect after 28 days when examined two hours after the last dose; however, after 24 hours after the last dose, the high dose reduced complex II + III activity in the striatum and both doses reduced complex IV activity in the hippocampus, with no effects in other regions.

In general, mild uncoupling under proper conditions can promote weight loss and help generate heat when it is needed but chemically inducing indiscriminate uncoupling can lead to toxicity at high enough doses.\n\nIn rat liver, 10 milligrams per kilogram for 12 days appeared to accumulate in mitochondrial membranes and act as an uncoupler, which promotes the use of energy to generate heat without making ATP.

They considered this an increase or decrease in “metabolism” and the authors did not measure citrate synthase activity or the activity of any other respiratory chain complexes, making it impossible to put the changes into the context of an overall pattern. Further, they measured complex IV activity in over forty brain regions and considered statistical significance to be P<0.05. They did not even include a statistics section so presumably did not make adjustments for making so many comparisons, and you would expect two spurious results at that significance level with over 40 comparisons made. Thus, this study should be disregarded as noise.\n\nIn congenitally helpless rats, who are selectively bred to exhibit signs of depression, 5 milligrams per kilogram fluoxetine per day for two weeks increased complex IV activity in one brain region and decreased it in another.

Again, complex IV activity was measured without measuring activity of citrate synthase or other respiratory chain complexes.\n\n\nIn female rats, complex IV went up in the prefrontal cortex in response to both stress and fluoxetine, but there was no interaction between the two stimuli, while in the hippocampus complex IV only went up in response to the combination of stress and fluoxetine.\n\nIn male rats, complex IV went down in the prefrontal cortex in response to both stress and fluoxetine but there was no interaction between the two stimuli, while in the hippocampus it went up in response to fluoxetine alone and down in response to stress, while fluoxetine had no ability to rescue the negative effect of stress.\n\nThe authors were interested in the glucocorticoid receptor as mediating this effect, but this research was done before the importance of the sigma-1 receptor was appreciated.

Fluoxetine increased citrate synthase activity in both the hypothalamus and the skeletal muscle, consistent with a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. It increased uncoupling in both tissues, consistent with the previous study shown in rat liver.

Fluoxetine partly mitigated the decrease in complex II activity in the brain and fully mitigated it in the heart, while it fully restored ATP production in the brain and did nothing to protect ATP production in the heart. The activities of citrate synthase and other respiratory chain complexes were not measured so we cannot properly situate the complex II activity into an overall pattern, but counteracting psychological stress suggests fluoxetine is improving the expected sigma-1 receptor activity response to that stress.\n\nIn adolescent rats subjected to four weeks of social isolation with or without 21 days of 7.5 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight fluoxetine administered orally through drinking water, social isolation lowered complex II activity and ATP production in brain and heart.

Injection could double the bioavailability to 10-20 milligrams per bodyweight per day. 5-20 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight is the equivalent of a human taking 0.8-3.24 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight. The doses used in humans are 10-60 milligrams per day for ages 8-17 and as high as 80 milligrams per day in adults. For an 8-year-old, 56-pound female, these are 0.4-2.4 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight, and for a 154-pound adult they are 0.1-1.1 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight. Thus, these reflect the higher end of what might be given to a healthy-weight adult and overlap quite well with what might be given to a child.\n\nHow Does Prozac Act As a Performance-Enhancing Drug?\n\nWe are now equipped to answer a question raised in the first article in this series, how Prozac (fluoxetine) acts as a performance-enhancing drug.\n\nIn that article, we reviewed a 2019 paper showed that, in mice, fluoxetine is a performance-enhancing drug.\n\nThe answer is that it acted as a mitochondrial-enhancing drug.\n\nFluoxetine augmented the increase in skeletal muscle citrate synthase that occurred in response to exercise, but it didn’t increase citrate synthase in sedentary mice.\n\nExercise and fluoxetine seemed to synergistically increase complex IV activity, but variability prevented the statistics from showing the interaction robustly and statistical significance was only shown between the exercised mice with and without fluoxetine.\n\nNo other specific respiratory chain complexes were measured, making it difficult to interpret complex IV in the context of an overall pattern.\n\nThe likely effect here was that fluoxetine activated sigma-1 receptors in muscle, increasing intracellular serotonin synthesis, which acted on mitochondrial serotonin receptors and enabled mitochondrial melatonin synthesis. This could have resulted in improved ATP production, which is needed for both muscle protein synthesis and mitochondrial biogenesis. This could also have preserved respiratory chain function during the relative hypoxia of exercise, improving performance.\n\nWith that said, the studies collectively show fluoxetine could have many different effects on mitochondria. These include promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, enhancing mitochondrial function by activating the sigma-1 receptor, activating or inhibiting the hypoxia response, increasing intracellular serotonin synthesis to protect mitochondrial respiration, serving as a mitochondrial uncoupler, and directly inhibiting ATP synthase.\n\nFluoxetine seems to be more often protective of mitochondria than not, but with conflicting effects in different tissues, brain regions, and even in different mitochondria within a single cell.\n\nNot All SSRIs Are the Same\n\nSome of the differences in SSRIs that stand out are as follows:\n\nSertraline and fluvoxamine are powerful activators of the sigma-1 receptor while the other SSRIs are not. This is acutely beneficial to mitochondrial function, and critical to protection of respiration during hypoxia, though there is an outstanding question of whether long-term use chronically promoting mitophagy would be good by eliminating damaged mitochondria or bad by excessively reducing mitochondrial density.\n\nSertraline and fluvoxamine are powerful activators of the sigma-1 receptor while the other SSRIs are not.

Whether other SSRIs inhibit these receptors is less clear. However, it may be more significant that the well-characterized differences in sigma-1 activation preserve respiration in the face of hypoxia, and this would put fluovaxamine and sertraline in the net protective camp, put fluoxetine in the middle, and put citalopram, escitalopram and paroxetine in the harmful anti-respiration bucket.\n\nWhile all SSRIs can promote the cellular hypoxia response by increasing extracellular serotonin and can inhibit the transport of serotonin into the cell where it would be needed to preserve cellular respiration during the hypoxia response, it is at least the case that fluoxetine and escitalopram, and to a lesser extent paroxetine, may stand out in their ability to inhibit that intracellular preservation of respiration by inhibiting 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors.

Chronic use of fluoxetine has no effect on markers of mitochondrial density in adult rats, but withdrawal from fluoxetine hurts them, suggesting mitochondria become dependent on it for a normal signal stimulating biogenesis.

You can read it here:\n\nSSRI Withdrawal Is Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nIn analyzing the biochemical data of clients over the last year I have worked on two cases involving catastrophic failures of energy metabolism that occurred in the wake of SSRI withdrawal. In both cases, switching SSRIs from one to another also seemed to play a role in precipitating energetic dysfunction.\n\nSubtitle: Installment six in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.\n\nDescription: Installment six in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.",

    "title": "How Serotonin Helps You Breathe",
    "content": "We cannot understand what SSRIs are really doing without understanding how serotonin is impacting mitochondrial energy metabolism.\n\nYet, we also cannot truly understand that either unless we first situate it in the context of serotonin serving as the traffic cop of our lungs.\n\nTherefore, the fourth installment of our series covers this traffic cop role.\n\nEvery thing we do — whether sleeping, eating, exercising, listening, imagining, or creating — requires oxygen from the air we breathe. That oxygen travels to the heart of complex IV in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and facilitates our production of cellular energy in the form of ATP. That cellular energy fuels everything.\n\nWhen we take in a breath, some parts of our lungs are more oxygenated than others. Which parts are most oxygenated changes over the course of the breath as the oxygen is removed into our blood.\n\nIf our blood perfuses a poorly oxygenated area of our lungs expecting to find oxygen, not only will it be disappointed but we can develop a form of “ventilation/perfusion mismatch” (“V/Q mismatch”), which can cause hypoxemia (low blood oxygen), shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and confusion.\n\nWhile typical discussions of V/Q mismatch focus on not having the right ratio of ventilation (breathing) to perfusion (blood flow), here we are discussing a form of V/Q mismatch due to spacial distribution of the blood: the blood is perfusing into the areas that are poorly ventilated (oxygenated) instead of selectively perfusing the areas that are well ventilated.\n\nSerotonin acts as the traffic cop: it shuts down the flow of blood into poorly oxygenated areas and redirects it to flow into the well oxygenated areas.\n\nThis allows you to avoid wasting blood flow where it won’t have high oxygen payoff, thereby keeping high return on investment for each pump of blood you engage in and each breath you take.\n\nThis also has a dark side: if you are subject to chronic hypoxia, serotonin will facilitate the remodeling of the vasculature of your lungs in a way that promotes pulmonary hypertension, which can often feel like hypoxia or V/Q mismatch except it often is accompanied by chest pain, and it can become chronic or quasi-permanent.\n\nIn this article, we explore the science of how serotonin helps make every breath worth taking.\n\nSerotonin and Its Receptors\n\nSerotonin is derived from the amino acid tryptophan in two steps involving adding a hydroxyl group (OH) to its ring structure and removing the carboxyl group (COOH) that makes it an acid. Because the carboxyl group is removed it is no longer an amino acid but rather an amine, and its alternative name better reflects its structure and derivation, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT).\n\nSerotonin acts in the nervous system, gut, lungs, blood, heart, adrenals, bladder, and immune system, and many other tissues by binding to a receptor on the cell surface that then elicits a response in the target cell.\n\nWhile pharmacology and psychiatry primarily regard the serotonin transporter as a means to remove serotonin from the neuronal synapse to lessen its activity, cells that respond to serotonin also use the serotonin transporter to take serotonin inside the cell where it can bind to serotonin receptors on a number of different organelles, including mitochondria.\n\nAs we covered in the previous installment, serotonin transporters are NOT found mostly, primarily, or even disproportionately in the brain. Outside the brain they are not found mostly, primarily, or even disproportionately in neurons. Serotonin and its transporter are primarily non-brain, non-neuronal molecules.\n\nThere are at least 15 different serotonin receptors divided into seven different families, most of which have two or more subtypes. These include 5-HT1 receptors, subtyped A through F; 5-HT2 receptors, subtyped A through C; 5-HT3A and B receptors; 5-HT5 A and B receptors; and then three families that each have only one lone receptor per family: 5-HT4, 6, and 7.\n\nThis diversity of receptors allows downstream responses to serotonin to be regulated differently by serotonin levels as well as by other signals, allowing serotonin to perform many different functions in different contexts.\n\nThe diversity can be further enhanced by different serotonin receptors binding to one another in complexes, by them forming complexes with other unrelated receptors, and possibly by two of the same receptor types binding together in a complex.\n\n5-HT3 receptors allow sodium and potassium ions to flow through when activated by serotonin, which creates a change in the voltage across a membrane that induces downstream signaling.\n\nAll other known 5-HT receptors are coupled to intracellular signaling cascades mediated by the activation of G proteins, which are very common orchestrators of such cascades throughout metabolism.\n\n5-HT1A and B receptors are notable for their occurrence on the axons, bodies, and dendrites of serotonin-releasing neurons where they form “autoreceptors” that regulate serotonin release and reuptake partly as a form of negative feedback against excessive serotonin signaling. These same receptors, however, can also be found on post-synaptic dendrites where they facilitate serotonin signaling in the downstream neuron, playing roles in regulating aggression, anxiety, addiction, appetite, memory, learning, mood, sleep, and the perception of pain and temperature.\n\n5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors are especially important in the gastrointestinal tract, where they stimulate gastrointestinal motility but in excess can cause diarrhea and vomiting. However, they too are found in the central nervous system where they play roles in cognitive function, emotions, appetite, pain, and the gag reflex.\n\nThe functional roles of the diversity of receptors are overlapping and extremely complex, making them difficult to analyze and a perpetual fertile ground for new discoveries.\n\nSerotonin’s Role in the Whole-Body Response to Hypoxia\n\nThe acute whole-body response to hypoxia is mediated by a homeostatic oxygen-sensing system composed of neuroepithelial bodies in the lungs, glomus cells of the carotid bodies of the carotid artery, smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary arterioles and capillaries; and the systemic arteries.\n\nWithin fractions of a second, the opening and closing of ion channels has acute effects on factors such as the dilation or constriction of blood vessels and the rate of breathing; over the course of minutes and hours, changes to gene expression take place, with varying responses over the course of less than eight hours, more than eight hours, or long-term effects of chronic constant hypoxia or chronic intermittent hypoxia.\n\nWhen hypoxia becomes severe enough, all cells of all tissues will participate in the response to their own level of hypoxia, and some cells are chronically hypoxic due to low blood supply, such as cells of the lens, cornea, and testes.\n\nThat serotonin is involved in the hypoxia response is suggested on the surface by the fact that serotonin syndrome – a dangerous constellation of symptoms caused by excessive serotonin exposure – is usually accompanied by an increase in the breathing rate.\n\nThe clearest role of serotonin in the hypoxia response is in the signaling of the neuroepithelial bodies of the lungs, which are innervated cell clusters with built-in oxygen sensors. The fact that these are most prominent around the time of birth and decline in density steeply thereafter has led to the hypothesis that they are primarily important in the neonatal period. However, while they might be especially important during that period, they do not decline to zero density, and animal experiments suggest they are important in adults. For example, adult mice with genetic deletions in their hypoxia response display overgrowth of these bodies. Adult mice with genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of the 5-HT2B receptor, moreover, fail to engage in the tissue remodeling that otherwise occurs in response to chronic hypoxia, which is the basis for the pulmonary hypertension that occurs with such remodeling. These findings lean in the direction of these bodies retaining importance in adults.\n\nThe oxygen sensing in these bodies depends on hydrogen peroxide produced from oxygen primarily by the enzyme NADPH oxidase in the cytosol and by the respiratory chain in the mitochondria. NADPH oxidase uses riboflavin (vitamin B2) in its activated form of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and the niacin (vitamin B3)-derived reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to convert oxygen to the free radical superoxide, which is converted to hydrogen peroxide by the zinc- and copper-dependent cytosolic superoxide dismutase. The mitochondria of these cells also make superoxide in proportion to oxygen flux that is converted to hydrogen peroxide by the manganese-dependent mitochondrial superoxide dismutase.\n\nThis hydrogen peroxide oxidizes a cysteine residue in a potassium channel, which keeps it open. Hypoxia leads to an acute drop in hydrogen peroxide that closes the channel, triggering a change in the voltage across the membrane, stimulating a calcium influx that initiates release of serotonin.\n\nPart of this serotonin travels up the vagus nerve to the brainstem where it can interact with brainstem centers that regulate breathing. Mice lacking the serotonin transporter, and thus having elevated extracellular serotonin, have a higher breathing rate both at normal oxygen levels and during hypoxic exposure. While it is not statistically significant, they seem to have a slightly exaggerated increase in the breathing rate in response to hypoxia as well.\n\nThe increase of the breathing rate during exposure to normal oxygen levels could reflect participation of extracellular serotonin in the basal tone of the hypoxia response, which is never dialed down to zero.\n\nCollectively, the findings above show that serotonin mediates a part of the response to both acute hypoxia by increasing the breathing rate and chronic hypoxia by mediating tissue remodeling.\n\nThe impact of serotonin in hypoxia is not limited to that secreted by the neuroepithelial bodies into the vagus nerve:\n\nBlood vessels respond to serotonin, as clearly demonstrated by the impact of 5-HT2B receptor inhibition on hypoxia-induced vascular remodeling.\n\nBlood vessels respond to serotonin, as clearly demonstrated by the impact of 5-HT2B receptor inhibition on hypoxia-induced vascular remodeling.\n\nCarotid bodies contain serotonin and possess serotonin receptors.\n\nCarotid bodies contain serotonin and possess serotonin receptors.\n\nThe raphe magnus, a part of the brainstem that serves as a major source of serotonin within the central nervous system, has anatomical connections to the parts of the brainstem that control the breathing rate, and hypoxia increases their production of serotonin. In rats, injecting an agonist of the 5HT1A receptor directly into this structure lowers serotonin production; this has no effect on the breathing rate during exposure to normal air, but it blunts the increase in the breathing rate in response to hypoxia.\n\nThe raphe magnus, a part of the brainstem that serves as a major source of serotonin within the central nervous system, has anatomical connections to the parts of the brainstem that control the breathing rate, and hypoxia increases their production of serotonin.

Therefore, it is likely that platelets release serotonin into the general circulation during hypoxia.\n\nHypoxia increases platelet activation, and when platelets activate they release serotonin. Therefore, it is likely that platelets release serotonin into the general circulation during hypoxia.\n\nSerotonin that is in the blood outside of the platelets is called “circulating free serotonin.” In preterm infants, those with circulating free serotonin had half as many hypoxemia events as those without any detectable free serotonin, consistent with circulating free serotonin protecting against hypoxia.\n\nSerotonin that is in the blood outside of the platelets is called “circulating free serotonin.” In preterm infants, those with circulating free serotonin had half as many hypoxemia events as those without any detectable free serotonin, consistent with circulating free serotonin protecting against hypoxia.\n\nSynthesizing all this, the secretion of serotonin in response to hypoxia starts as soon as a neuroepithelial body in the lungs senses a hypoxic breath. This is then increased further as hypoxia spreads to the carotid bodies of the carotid artery and then to the raphe magnus of the brainstem. As the systemic circulation becomes hypoxic, platelets release serotonin into it that can be taken up by any tissue.\n\nSerotonin promotes vasoconstriction of the pulmonary arteries during hypoxia by acting directly on smooth muscle cells. All other things being equal, constricting a blood vessel raises blood pressure by increasing the tension where the blood pushes against the blood vessel wall. Thus, this is a component of the pulmonary hypertension that can develop during hypoxia.\n\nHowever, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is absolutely essential in day-to-day breathing because this is mechanism by which blood perfusion is matched to well-oxygenated lung segments.\n\nAs a specific segment becomes relatively hypoxic compared to other segments, serotonin locally constricts the blood vessel, conserving blood to flow into the better-oxygenated segments.\n\nThus, serotonin plays a role as traffic cop, helping direct the blood away from poorly oxygenated lung segments and conserving blood flow for where the best oxygen payloads are found.\n\nNow that we properly understand how entwined serotonin is in the behavior of our lungs during hypoxia and in the whole-body physiological response to hypoxia, we can better discuss the science of how serotonin impacts the mitochondria.\n\nThat is the topic of the next installment. Read it here:\n\nYour Mitochondria and the Two Faces of Serotonin\n\nIn our series on how to understand the truth about serotonin, SSRIs, SSRI side effects, and the sometimes devastating effects of SSRI withdrawal, we have so far established that serotonin is a primarily non-brain non-neuronal signaling chemical that is fundamentally involved in the hypoxia response, and is also the substance from which we make melatonin…\n\nSubtitle: Installment four in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.\n\nDescription: Installment four in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.",

    "title": "Melatonin Is Your Mitochondria's Guardian Angel",
    "content": "As our story moves on from the first installment in our journey toward understanding why Prozac is a performance-enhancing drug, why people who use SSRIs often develop sexual dysfunction, and why people who quit SSRIs can feel electric shocks running through their head as if they were trying to exit a relationship with an abusive partner with an electrifying temper, we need to properly define what serotonin is doing to our systems of energy metabolism.\n\nYet, we cannot do that without first acknowledging that it is the essential precursor to melatonin.\n\nWhile melatonin has an essential role in syncing our sleep and wake cycle to the daily rhythm of light and darkness, it has a completely independent role inside our cells that is virtually unrelated to this rhythm and is primarily related to mitochondrial energy production.\n\nAs shown below, serotonin is derived from the amino acid tryptophan, which is then acetylated by acetyl CoA and methylated by S-adenosylmethionine to produce melatonin.\n\nThe intracellular role of melatonin remains poorly understood and widely speculated upon, but the most informative study on the distribution of intracellular melatonin and its lack of relationship to the circadian rhythm is a rat study published in 2012.\n\nThree groups of rats were studied. Two groups were subject to a 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycle and either had their pineal gland removed or were subjected to a fake procedure that mimicked the surgery but did not remove the pineal gland. The third was exposed to light for 24 hours a day.\n\nAs expected, melatonin in the plasma remained low during exposure to light. It dramatically spiked after about 5 or 6 hours of darkness, largely returning to the normally low level by two hours before the lights came back on. In the rats that had their pineal gland removed, however, no spike in melatonin occurred. Thus, plasma melatonin is derived from the pineal gland in direct response to the light/dark cycle.\n\nHowever, while the intracellular melatonin exhibits some variation across the day, it has no such pronounced relation to the light/dark cycle.\n\nThe circles below reflect the intracellular melatonin of normal rats and the triangles reflect rats who had their pineal gland removed.\n\nRemoving the pineal gland appears to initiate a stress response that increases intracellular melatonin synthesis.\n\nThis is the brain:\n\nThis is the liver:\n\nUnfortunately, they did not report the diurnal variation of intracellular melatonin concentrations in rats exposed to continuous light.\n\nHowever, they sacrificed rats at the 12-hour mark in all three groups:\n\nThe above figure shows the brain at the top and the liver on the bottom. Continuous light exposure tended to raise intracellular melatonin just like removing the pineal gland, though to a somewhat lesser degree.\n\nThis indicates that cells respond to the stress of circadian disruption by increasing their own synthesis of melatonin.\n\nIn the normal rats, however, it is highly likely that the circulating melatonin produced by the pineal gland is the primary source of cellular melatonin.\n\nFirst, because, unlike serotonin, melatonin is fat-soluble enough to easily slip across cell membranes in a completely unregulated fashion. That is also why the melatonin seems to disproportionately accumulate in the membranes in this study.\n\nSecond, if you look at the diurnal variation, while there is no clear spike during the darkness, you can make out a general trend for melatonin to slip upwards during the dark and downwards during the light. My suspicion is the rapid disappearance of melatonin from plasma has almost nothing to do with its catabolism and almost everything to do with its cellular uptake. Inside cells, melatonin is not rapidly degraded. It largely sits there in watch.\n\nIn watch of what?\n\nWell, the fact that intracellular melatonin synthesis flips into high gear during the stress of circadian disruption gives us a clue.\n\nRemoving the pineal gland from rats causes oxidative stress, oxidative damage, and inflammation in their eyes that is reversed by supplementing them with 5 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight melatonin. They thought this was from melatonin deficiency, but they didn’t measure the cellular melatonin. We know from the study above that it goes up. So circadian disruption puts stress on cells, they respond by increasing melatonin synthesis, but they don’t synthesize enough.\n\nRats an mice are nocturnal, yet their plasma and pineal melatonin behaves the same as that of humans’ in response to light. As reviewed here, even though bright light at night puts these rodents to sleep instead of keeping them up, it still disrupts their circadian rhythm and causes them to become obese and diabetic. Their daily rhythms of cortisol, insulin sensitivity, movement, and food intake become completely destroyed.\n\nData from rodents, non-human primates, and humans collectively suggest that there is a natural rhythmic ebb an flow of oxygen consumption that makes the mitochondrial respiratory chain slow down across the duration of the sleeping period and perk up when we are active. This requires adequate preparation for a number of reasons:\n\nPumping oxygen through blood actually requires considerable energy and during sleep all of our tissues are supposed to rest.\n\nPumping oxygen through blood actually requires considerable energy and during sleep all of our tissues are supposed to rest.\n\nIf influx of energy into the respiratory chain exceeds the availability of oxygen to finish metabolizing it, a “traffic jam” of electrons will ensue, creating potentially damaging reactive oxygen species.\n\nIf influx of energy into the respiratory chain exceeds the availability of oxygen to finish metabolizing it, a “traffic jam” of electrons will ensue, creating potentially damaging reactive oxygen species.\n\nResponding to this with post-hoc adaptive mechanisms also requires considerable energy and disrupts rest.\n\nResponding to this with post-hoc adaptive mechanisms also requires considerable energy and disrupts rest.\n\nSo it is likely that the energetic stress of circadian disruption is fundamentally a matter of failing to adequately prepare for the energetic shifts that are supposed to occur as we transition between sleeping and waking.\n\nYou can see in the above figures that melatonin is very enriched in brain mitochondria, and just moderately higher than the nucleus and cytosol in liver.\n\nHowever, we will see in the next installment of this series that melatonin is synthesized in the mitochondria, consumed in the mitochondria, and leaves the mitochondria to act on the outside of the mitochondrial membrane in a way that fundamentally protects the mitochondria from stress, and that this protective effect goes far beyond the stress imposed by circadian disruption.\n\nI hereby dub melatonin the “guardian angel” of the mitochondria because:\n\nIt is always present, keeping watch.\n\nIt is always present, keeping watch.\n\nYou may go by never noticing it or believing it is there.\n\nYou may go by never noticing it or believing it is there.\n\nWhen you need protection, that’s when it steps into action.\n\nWhen you need protection, that’s when it steps into action.\n\nRead the next installment here:\n\nSerotonin in the Mitochondria Means Your Cells Are Fighting to Survive\n\nThe next installment in our series on the true nature of SSRIs gets into the true nature of serotonin and its powerful impact on energy metabolism.\n\nSubtitle: Installment two in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.\n\nDescription: Installment two in our series on understanding the truth about SSRIs.",

    "title": "Prozac is a Performance-Enhancing Drug",
    "content": "We kick off this series on the real truth about SSRIs by making the seemingly wild observation that Prozac is a performance-enhancing drug in mice.\n\nIt synergizes with exercise to build muscle and grip strength, and it builds endurance capacity in couch potatoes.\n\nDoes this mean you should take Prozac? Absolutely not. I wouldn’t touch this stuff with a 14,000-foot pole.\n\nBut what it does mean is that if your doctor thinks SSRIs are primarily psychiatric drugs, your doctor does not understand SSRIs.\n\nIf you think SSRIs are primarily moderating your mood, you do not understand SSRIs.\n\nForty-eight mice were divided into four groups: a six-week treadmill-based exercise program with Prozac or a saline placebo, or a six-week sedentary period with Prozac or a saline placebo. The Prozac was administered orally in the drinking water at 18 milligrams per kilogram body weight, which is the equivalent of a human taking 1.46 milligrams per kilogram body weight. The doses used in humans are 10-60 milligrams per day for ages 8-17 and as high as 80 milligrams per day in adults. For a 55-pound, 8-year-old female, this is 0.4-2.4 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight. For a 154-pound adult, this is 0.14-1.14 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight. Thus, the mouse dose is equivalent to a relatively high dose given to a relatively lower-weight individual.\n\nProzac increased the growth of the calf muscles in the mice that exercised:\n\nWhile only the Prozac+exercise group gained statistical significance, this is probably because the study is statistically underpowered to detect the synergy. If you just look at the tops of the bars, they increase as you go from sedentary alone to sedentary with Prozac, from sedentary to exercise, and from exercise alone to exercise with Prozac.\n\nThe synergy was much more powerfully demonstrated for grip strength:\n\nOn the other hand, Prozac acted as a mediocre and inferior substitute for exercise on aerobic metrics.\n\nThis was true for maximal aerobic velocity:\n\nAnd for time to exhaustion:\n\nHowever, I don’t quite trust the lack of synergy here. The time to exhaustion graph looks like there is an exercise+Prozac interaction that is smaller than the effects of exercise alone or Prozac alone but might nevertheless be real and not statistically significant due to lack of statistical power. For the impact on maximal aerobic velocity, it may well be that exercise maxxed out this metric and there was nothing else to do for Prozac, but I do wonder whether we would have seen different results if the mice on the exercise program were given a deload week for maximal recovery prior to their big competition.\n\nProzac also increased the VO2max of the mice who exercised:\n\nNow, you may think that the mice just grew bigger muscles and gained more grip strength because they were happier (LOL) and therefore just worked out harder.\n\nThen you can preserve the mythology that SSRIs are primarily psychiatric drugs acting on mood.\n\nBut as it turns out, exercise considerably outperformed Prozac in improving the mental health of the mice.\n\nThe behavioral tests they ran are primarily tests of anxiety rather than depression. However, these tests tend to correlate with one another in mice, so the authors are somewhat justified in considering these measures of “anxio-depression.”\n\nMice that have less anxiety and depression spend more time in the center of open field tests and in the open arms of elevated plus mazes.\n\nExercise alone was more powerful than Prozac alone in increasing time spent in the center of open field tests:\n\nWhen the time spent moving within the center was compared to the total time spent moving, the impact of Prozac alone lost statistical significance and only the impact of exercise was statistically robust:\n\nOnce again these look like there is a Prozac/exercise interaction and the statistical power is too low to detect each comparison.\n\nHowever, it remains the case that exercise is a more powerful antidepressant than Prozac.\n\nFor the elevated plus maze we want to see higher white bars, and once again it looks like there is a Prozac/exercise interaction but Prozac is more powerful than exercise and the statistics are underpowered:\n\nIf we compare the performance-enhancing effects to the behavioral effects we can say this:\n\nExercise provided a more powerful antidepressant effect than Prozac.\n\nExercise provided a more powerful antidepressant effect than Prozac.\n\nProzac produced more growth of the calf muscle than exercise.\n\nProzac produced more growth of the calf muscle than exercise.\n\nProzac produced a nearly identical and additive boost in grip strength.\n\nProzac produced a nearly identical and additive boost in grip strength.\n\nEspecially on strength and muscle growth, the effect of Prozac is clearly separated from its antidepressant effect.\n\nNone of this is meant to say you should use Prozac for performance enhancement. You should apply the same skepticism to this as you should toward injecting synthetic cattle hormones into your butt to build muscle.\n\nRather, the point here is that SSRIs do not do what you think they do. As we move along in this series over the course of this coming week, all of this will make much more sense.\n\nThe take-home points for now are these:\n\nPharma has no idea what they are drugging you with.\n\nPharma has no idea what they are drugging you with.\n\nSSRIs don’t do what your doctor thinks they do.\n\nSSRIs don’t do what your doctor thinks they do.\n\nSerotonin isn’t whatever you think it is.\n\nSerotonin isn’t whatever you think it is.\n\nRead the next installment here:\n\nMelatonin Is Your Mitochondria's Guardian Angel\n\nAs our story moves on from the first installment in our journey toward understanding why Prozac is a performance-enhancing drug, why people who use SSRIs often develop sexual dysfunction, and why people who quit SSRIs can feel electric shocks running through their head as if they were trying to exit a relationship with an abusive partner with an electri…\n\nSubtitle: What they never tell you about SSRIs.\n\nDescription: What they never tell you about SSRIs.",

    "title": "Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy Is Mitochondrial Dysfunction",
    "content": "Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a hypersensitive reaction to mitochondrial dysfunction in the mother in order to avert greater mitochondrial dysfunction in the more sensitive baby.\n\nIn this article, we look at the fascinating intersection between pregnancy and mitochondrial dysfunction and outline what to do to prevent this at least annoying and sometimes devastating phenomenon without trying to interfere with its important protective functions.\n\nInterest in the causes of and solutions to nausea and vomiting in pregnancy focuses on levels of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). While this model is correct, it is incomplete. These models generally ignore the contribution of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which likely runs in parallel to GDF15 with these two compounds having very interrelated purposes of their signaling.\n\nH2S is a normal, healthy, beneficial signaling compound at low concentrations and a lethal toxin at high concentrations. In between, it stimulates nausea and vomiting in order to create an aversion to whatever is raising its level so that further toxicity can be avoided. Vomiting also may help purge the source of it out of the body.\n\nGDF15 is secreted from the placenta during pregnancy in very large amounts. It travels through the bloodstream and acts on the glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor α-like protein (GFRAL) in the neurons of the area postrema and solitary tract nucleus in the brain, where it inhibits appetite, induces aversions, and at high levels causes nausea and vomiting.\n\nH2S is similarly made at high concentrations by the placenta. One of its major functions as a normal signaling compound is to signal blood vessel relaxation and the synthesis of new blood vessels. H2S therefore helps vascularize the placenta, and also helps relax the placental vasculature so that it does not tighten up around the fetus and restrict growth.\n\nWhile H2S from the placenta is very unlikely to reach the brain, H2S rises in response to estrogen, which does reach the brain. H2S is produced locally by the brain, so it is very likely that the rise in estrogen facilitates a local rise in H2S in the brain that acts alongside GDF15 to stimulate food aversions, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nTo put these compounds in their proper context, we need to look at the reasons they are produced outside of pregnancy.\n\nIn particular, GDF15 rises to levels in mitochondrial disorders that overlap with those levels seen in pregnancy, including the higher levels seen in women with nausea and vomiting. This raises the possibility that mitochondrial dysfunction could massively elevate the amount of GDF15 produced during pregnancy, and it raises the question of why pregnancy and mitochondrial dysfunction would share this characteristic.\n\nGDF15 is synthesized under ordinary conditions in the liver, lung, kidney, and adipose tissue. The levels produced are usually very low, but rise in inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. It has actions beyond those involved in producing nausea and vomiting that improve metabolic health. Animal experiments show that it increases lipolysis and thermogenesis, independent of any impacts on food intake. Deleting GDF15 from mice makes them develop late-onset obesity. A synthetic agonist of the GFRAL receptor mimicking GDF15 was able to cause modest weight loss in humans by suppressing appetite without causing any nausea.\n\nGDF15 synthesis is induced by the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and the integrated stress response, which are two pathways for dealing with reactive oxygen species and other damaging compounds that interfere with mitochondrial function. In general, these responses inhibit protein synthesis and increase protein-folding chaperones, while inhibiting food intake and improving the ability to effectively and cleanly burn energy. Thus, it is likely that one of the most basic functions of GDF15 is to inhibit the intake of excessive energy when mitochondria are stressed, until they can improve the capacity to handle that energy.\n\nOn the other hand, when one is exposed to an acute toxin that causes nausea and vomiting, the higher level of GDF15 serves to purge the toxin from the body and create an aversion to its current and future exposure.\n\nH2S is produced as part of the hypoxia response. The hypoxia response itself can trigger the integrated stress response, and they each have overlapping triggers and outcomes. However, the hypoxia response is much more concertedly focused on resolving reactive oxygen species that are produced due to “traffic jams” in the respiratory chain where incoming electrons run into blocks, usually but not always due to inadequate oxygen in complex IV. As a result, it stimulates the production of erythropoietin and testosterone, which help build red blood cells; iron absorption and synthesis of hemoglobin, which helps red blood cells deliver oxygen; detox of manganese, which interferes with iron’s role in CoQ10 synthesis and possibly other roles; synthesis of new blood vessels, which deliver oxygen to hypoxic tissues, dormancy of complex I in the respiratory chain, which reduces inflow of new electrons; synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which help facilitate movement of electrons through the chain; and increased efficiency of complex IV, which draws electrons toward oxygen to complete their journey.\n\nIf these responses bring H2S concentrations back to normal, it is unlikely it builds up to the degree needed to cause nausea and vomiting. However, if they do not, H2S stimulation of aversion, nausea and vomiting could help purge toxins from the body or create an aversion to its current and future exposure just like GDF15.\n\nIn fact, given the interrelations of their triggers, it is likely they often — but not always — rise together.\n\nIn pregnancy, it makes no sense that it would be adaptive to facilitate decreased appetite. This can be reconciled by considering the other effects pregnancy typically has on appetite.\n\nAppetite is regulated in large part by two opposing peptides in the hypothalamus, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) which inhibits appetite largely through being metabolized to the peptide hormone melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and agouti-related peptide (AgRP), which stimulates appetite. MSH not only inhibits appetite, but it also increases lipolysis. Adipose tissue makes the hormone leptin in proportion to its mass, and leptin levels rise after meals in proportion to their caloric load. Leptin then acts on the hypothalamus, in proportion to the efficiency of ATP extraction from available food energy within the hypothalamus, to increase POMC and decrease AgRP. Thus, as body fat and caloric intake decline, the drop in leptin helps stimulate appetite and fat storage. As body fat and caloric intake rise, the rise in leptin helps suppress appetite and increase adipose lipolysis.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the placenta makes soluble leptin receptors, which bind to leptin and prevent it from entering the brain. This decreases POMC and increases AgRP, leading to increased fat accretion, especially in the second trimester. After giving birth, these changes quickly reverse, allowing the accreted fat to be shed.\n\nThus, in pregnancy, the anorexic effect of H2S and GDF15 is opposed by placentally driven leptin resistance, which makes net appetite go up instead of down.\n\nHowever, the rise in GDF15 and H2S increases the sensitivity to previously programmed food aversions, which causes the mother to reduce her exposure to toxins that could interfere with the massive anabolic response that is needed.\n\nThe massive increase in energy demand likely communicates this through relative “mitochondrial dysfunction,” meaning an inability of mitochondria to meet that demand without systemic adjustments to increase blood supply and nutrient intake while decreasing toxin intake.\n\nEvolutionary biology literature tends to argue that the aversive response is meant to target teratogens that cause birth defects. However, it is difficult to imagine how it would be possible for two molecules — or even their more complex triggers and targets — that do nothing other than turn up the aversive tone to make the brain “know” what is teratogenic and what is not. This seems to require a mystical appeal to a universal human consciousness within which there is some historical record of what has caused birth defects across all time and space.\n\nIt is, further, difficult to conceive of how the mother could have developed aversions specifically to teratogens in the past unless they were also toxic to the mother herself.\n\nRather, it is likely that most things that are toxic to the baby are also toxic to the mother, but at much higher doses, and that increased aversion is meant to drive the mother to avoid toxic exposures in general.\n\nThe brain’s ability to know what is toxic is not perfect, but in general the brain tries to match aversions to toxic exposures and it overall works. Most teratogens are mitochondrial toxins, and most mitochondrial toxins are teratogens. There are exceptions, but broadly speaking teratogens are toxic to adults at some concentration and vice versa.\n\nThus, the solution to nausea, vomiting, and pregnancy likely is to optimize mitochondrial function and to remove any impairments in the clearance of hydrogen sulfide or the triggers of its formation.\n\nThe FDA-approved treatment for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a combination of the pyridoxine form of vitamin B6 and the antihistamine doxylamine. Other treatments used include other antihistamines, steroids, antiemetics, and ginger.\n\nVitamin B6 binds to sulfite and hydrogen sulfide so can help mop it up. However, it is one of the vitamins with a toxicity syndrome — which I covered in This is What Causes Vitamin B6 Toxicity — so a blunt tool for the job and not without risk.\n\nThe drugs used here are shooting the messenger.\n\nShutting down your vomiting response to allow your body to overlook mitochondrial dysfunction doesn’t fix your mitochondria. I am not saying no one should ever use these to relieve suffering, they just clearly aren’t fixing the problem.\n\nGinger is a complex food with complex actions. It may help move food along through the GI tract, lessening a need to expel it out the way it came in, but it also may improve mitochondrial function in many ways.\n\nIf ginger doesn’t do the trick, though, it is likely you need to address your idiosyncratic limitations in mitochondrial function and sulfur metabolism.\n\nAnyone with unresolved and unexplained nausea, including that of pregnancy, should run the Sulfur Protocol:\n\nClick Here for The Sulfur Protocol\n\nSince GDF15 rises in response to different triggers that are more specific to mitochondrial dysfunction and more generalizable across the breadth of idiosyncratic forms of mitochondrial dysfunction and does not always parallel H2S accumulation, anyone trying to solve a difficult case of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should run Mitome:\n\nClick Here to Get Mitome\n\nMitome reflects a year and a half of deep research into the causes of many different patterns of mitochondrial dysfunction, fused with my own cross-referencing over 100 sets of respiratory chain data with comprehensive whole genome sequencing and biochemical data (amino acids, organic acids, vitamins, minerals, and other markers) to distill ways of inferring causal patterns and effective actionable protocols from repeatable patterns within the respiratory chain data when used on its own. Mitome can be used to infer three important patterns in sulfur metabolism, including whether there appears to be increased sulfur flux, which of several different points is limiting sulfur detoxification, and whether you need more CoQ10 or should instead try an unnatural analog of CoQ10 called MitoQ that handles sulfur in a completely different manner, yet happens to be a miracle for the select few that need it. Mitome also simplifies this for you by automatically constructing your protocol for you.\n\nHave you suffered through nausea and vomiting in pregnancy? What helped you?\n\nLet me know in the comments.\n\nSubtitle: The fascinating intersection between pregnancy and mitochondrial dysfunction and what to do about it.\n\nDescription: The fascinating intersection between pregnancy and mitochondrial dysfunction and what to do about it.",

    "title": "What Causes Autism?",
    "content": "Autism has an incredibly powerful genetic component. This determines who is vulnerable to getting autism.\n\nAutism has an incredibly powerful environmental component. This determines how many people get autism and why it keeps increasing.\n\nSo what is that environmental component, and is there a role for vaccines? Let’s dig in.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nTwin studies show a powerful effect of genetics in autism. Identical twins share 96% of autism risk, while fraternal twins share 38% of autism risk.\n\nEven identical twins share an in utero environment. They are usually raised by the same family. They, like everyone else, shares the broader environment to some extent with their communities at various levels ranging from small groups to the entire world.\n\nSo, the impact of environment is definitely greater than the 4% of difference found among identical twins. The heritability estimates from these studies range from 64-91%. The estimate depends on how the prevalence of autism is modeled: if it is modeled as a large spectrum with high prevalence, genetics takes a stronger role; if it is modeled with a stricter definition and a lower prevalence, environment takes a bigger role.\n\nFraternal twins share everything that identical twins share except an extra 50% of their genetics. As such, the 2.5-fold greater autism risk shared by identical twins makes it indisputable that there is a powerful genetic component to autism.\n\nIt is very important that if the environment does not vary, its influence is masked.\n\nFor example, if governments the world over mandate that an important environmental cause of autism is put into everyone’s water supply, the impact of this influence will be completely muted because it is shared by everyone.\n\nIf the relevant genes had to be triggered by a single environmental factor whose historical exposure level was zero, then a government mandate putting that factor into the water supply could make the incidence of autism go from zero to 5% practically overnight. The genes would go from irrelevant to 91% of the explanation overnight.\n\nIf different municipal governments had control over how much of that factor was put in the water, variability would be introduced. Suddenly the environmental factor’s influence would manifest in the statistics, and the heritability estimates would fall.\n\nThus, the heritability estimates can only be considered representative of the environmental conditions that prevailed when they were measured.\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a way to look at broad associations of common polymorphisms in large groups. Rare mutations do not show up in these studies due to lack of statistical power.\n\nThe largest and most powerful GWAS to date was published in Nature Genetics in 2019. It developed polygenic risk scores made from common variants that were only capable of explaining 2.5-3.8% of the variation in autism risk.\n\nOn the one hand, scoring in the top ten percent of polygenic risk indicated a 2.8-3.6-fold greater risk of autism. That means it has useful predictive power.\n\nOn the other hand, the very small proportion of risk explained compared to the heritability shown by twin studies suggests that common variations do not explain much of the total heritability. That is, as useful as the polygenic score may be, there is something else going on that is far more powerful.\n\nWe have to be careful here, though. As with the thought experiment on the government-mandated environmental trigger, if we postulate a “missing heritable factor” it could be the thing that turns on and off the relevance of the polygenic risk score.\n\nIn other words, suppose the “Mystery Heritable Factor X” is found in ten people. It may be that that within those ten people the polygenic risk score from common polymorphisms has nearly complete explanatory power for which of them get autism and which of them don’t.\n\nSome of the most important genes figuring into this score were NEGR1, a regulator of axon growth; PTBP2, a regulator of mRNA splicing; CADPS, a calcium-activated protein involved in releasing neurotransmitters and neuropeptides; KCNN2, a calcium-activated potassium channel involved in controlling neuronal excitability; KMT2E, an enzyme that uses methylation to control genomic stability; and MACROD2, an enzyme that clears away ADP-ribose in the nucleus made from the irreversible hydrolysis of the niacin (vitamin B3)-derived NAD+ during the reaction to cellular damage.\n\nThe featuring of two calcium-activated proteins in this score is interesting since oxalate is three times higher in autistics and binds to calcium. KMT2E is likely to interact with nutritional, genetic, and toxic factors governing methylation, and MACROD2 is likely to interact with nutritional, genetic, and toxic factors governing oxidative damage.\n\nMy contention is that the gigantic unexplained heritability is dominated by rare inborn errors of metabolism, mostly that compromise the production of cellular energy necessary to fuel the brain at critical stages of development.\n\nThe leading medical textbook on this topic, Saudubray, Inborn Metabolic Diseases: Diagnosis and Treatment, contains 76 uses of “autism” or “autistic” to describe autism as a consequence or comorbidity of these diseases.\n\nAutism has been associated with the following inborn errors of metabolism:\n\nPhenylketonuria, a defect in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine that leads to secondary depletion of most of the major neurotransmitters as well as the brain’s supply of methyl groups.\n\nPhenylketonuria, a defect in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine that leads to secondary depletion of most of the major neurotransmitters as well as the brain’s supply of methyl groups.\n\nCBS deficiency, which leads to toxic accumulation of homocysteine and deficient provision of downstream products such as cysteine, taurine, sulfate, and glutathione.\n\nCBS deficiency, which leads to toxic accumulation of homocysteine and deficient provision of downstream products such as cysteine, taurine, sulfate, and glutathione.\n\nSAH hydrolase deficiency, which blocks the methylation system prior to homocysteine formation and leads to a severe deficiency of methylation as well as toxic accumulation of the amino acid methionine and its aberrant alternative metabolites.\n\nSAH hydrolase deficiency, which blocks the methylation system prior to homocysteine formation and leads to a severe deficiency of methylation as well as toxic accumulation of the amino acid methionine and its aberrant alternative metabolites.\n\nBranched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase deficiency, which leads to the depletion of branched chain amino acids.

They include many B vitamin-related or -responsive disorders and several impacting methylation, but also disorders of too much or too little cholesterol, accumulation of toxic metabolites, defects in autophagy, and defects in neurotransmitter production.\n\nHow common are these disorders as a cause of autism?\n\nIn a series of 187 children with autism in Greece, five (2.7%) were diagnosed with inborn errors of metabolism.\n\nIn a series of 187 children with autism in Greece, five (2.7%) were diagnosed with inborn errors of metabolism.\n\nIn a series of 179 children with autism in Turkey, six (3.3%) were diagnosed with inborn errors of metabolism.\n\nIn a series of 179 children with autism in Turkey, six (3.3%) were diagnosed with inborn errors of metabolism.\n\nIn Iran, a series of 105 children found 13 (12.4%) had inborn errors of metabolism.\n\nIn Iran, a series of 105 children found 13 (12.4%) had inborn errors of metabolism.\n\nRates of inbreeding are highest in Iran and lowest in Greece, likely explaining the variation.\n\nHowever, analysis of metabolic biomarkers suggests vastly higher rates of impaired energy metabolism in autistics:\n\n17% have elevated lactate, indicating impaired pyruvate clearance or impaired respiratory chain activity.\n\n17% have elevated lactate, indicating impaired pyruvate clearance or impaired respiratory chain activity.\n\n41% have elevated pyruvate, indicating impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.\n\n41% have elevated pyruvate, indicating impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.\n\n28% have an elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, indicating impaired respiratory chain activity.\n\n28% have an elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, indicating impaired respiratory chain activity.\n\n19% have elevated acylcarnitines, indicating that CoA-requiring pathways such as fatty acid oxidation or the oxidation of BCAAs, lysine, or tryptophan, are causing sequestration of the CoA pool.\n\n19% have elevated acylcarnitines, indicating that CoA-requiring pathways such as fatty acid oxidation or the oxidation of BCAAs, lysine, or tryptophan, are causing sequestration of the CoA pool.\n\nAutistic children have three times more oxalate in their urine than controls.

Oxalate is a powerful mitochondrial toxin and also a byproduct of impaired metabolism with a number of enzyme mutations that can raise its levels.\n\nHeterozygosity for two metabolic disorders in closely enough related enzymes or pathways can often cause clinically relevant disease without it fitting into a diagnosable pattern. This is known as synergistic heterozygosity. While this gets almost no attention at all, it is mathematically impossible for it not to be far more common than diagnosable metabolic disease because the number of possible interactions among closely related enzymes and pathways is one or more orders of magnitude higher than the probability of two severe impairments occurring in the exact same gene.\n\nFurther, heterozygosity for a single metabolic disorder could become clinically important if some other stress hurts the function of the healthy copy of the gene sufficiently. For example, if someone is heterozygous for a rare, severe MTHFR mutation and also is homozygous for C677T and is also deficient in riboflavin and folate, at some point the cumulative stress on the allele that is not affected by the rare mutation will be so substantial that the person might as well be homozygous for the rare mutation.\n\nIf 2.7% of autistics in societies with low rates of inbreeding have diagnosable inborn errors of metabolism, then nearly all other autistics likely have clinically relevant heterozygosity for these disorders.\n\nThe resulting profound impairment in metabolic function then may or may not need to be co-present with some of the common polymorphisms in NEGR1, PTBP2, CADPS, KCNN2, KMT2E, and MACROD2 to result in autism.\n\nIt is likely that the underlying metabolic dysfunction has to be addressed early to prevent autism and may have much more limited utility if it is found afterwards. For example, two brothers had a deficiency of the biotin-recycling enzyme biotinidase. One was diagnosed at age four after having already been diagnosed with autism. Ten milligrams of biotin per day did not resolve his autistic behavior. His younger brother was identified as having the same disorder in newborn screening and was proactively supplemented with ten milligram of biotin per day. He never developed autism.\n\nThe incidence of autism appears to have been increasing globally by about 0.06% per year for decades. In the US, autism prevalence estimates increased from one in 150 to one in 44 between 2000 and 2018, to one in 36 by 2020, to — just released days ago — one in 31 by 2022. This indicates a particularly intense trend in the United States that persists in recent years despite enormous consciousness around the possibility for diagnostic changes to be occurring over time. While we cannot say for sure how diagnostic inflation could be impacting these estimates, it is almost certain that there is a real increase happening.\n\nIf the most important genetics tend to be in energy metabolism, then we would expect the following environmental modifiers of their influence:\n\nNutritional status, since vitamins and minerals are often cofactors of these enzymes.\n\nNutritional status, since vitamins and minerals are often cofactors of these enzymes.\n\nToxic exposures, since metals and other toxins can inhibit these enzymes.\n\nToxic exposures, since metals and other toxins can inhibit these enzymes.\n\nEnergetic demand from growth, pregnancy, exercise, and stress, since these can either lead to a deficiency of energy or the driving of macronutrients into impaired pathways that generate toxic byproducts (like ammonia or BCAA acyl CoA esters).\n\nEnergetic demand from growth, pregnancy, exercise, and stress, since these can either lead to a deficiency of energy or the driving of macronutrients into impaired pathways that generate toxic byproducts (like ammonia or BCAA acyl CoA esters).\n\nIncreases in body heat, since many defective enzymes are thermolabile, meaning even body heat is too hot, making them lose their shape or lose their binding ability for a nutritional cofactor, where any additional heat makes the defect much worse.\n\nIncreases in body heat, since many defective enzymes are thermolabile, meaning even body heat is too hot, making them lose their shape or lose their binding ability for a nutritional cofactor, where any additional heat makes the defect much worse.\n\nInflammation, which represents a special combination of the above: all inflammation signals energetic demand to deal with an internal crisis; this comes with increased nutrient demand to drive the higher rate of metabolism and the differentiation of immune cells; it is often accompanied by something toxic, such as a microbial toxin of an infection or vaccine, or the adjuvants of a vaccine; and it often increases body heat.\n\nInflammation, which represents a special combination of the above: all inflammation signals energetic demand to deal with an internal crisis; this comes with increased nutrient demand to drive the higher rate of metabolism and the differentiation of immune cells; it is often accompanied by something toxic, such as a microbial toxin of an infection or vaccine, or the adjuvants of a vaccine; and it often increases body heat.\n\nNutritional status is highly variable across the population, but will still have trends to look for over time.\n\nToxic exposures will vary according to individual lifestyle choices, but will also vary over time at a population level due to regulatory and industrial trends.\n\nEnergetic demand is going to be highly variable within an individual, and will mainly be determining the timing of the onset of a disorder within that individual and to some degree cumulative energetic demand and the peak magnitude of energetic demand will influence whether that individual becomes affected.\n\nInflammatory stress is likely to have major waves in a population according to infectious epidemics and vaccine policies.\n\nThe cumulative burden of these factors and how they temporally cluster in a person’s life can determine both the penetrance of a mutation causing a metabolic impairment and its timing of onset.\n\nThe penetrance is the degree to which a mutation causes disease within a population. If the penetrance is higher in the population, then any given individual with the mutation is more likely to be clinically impacted.\n\nThe timing of onset is impacted by when the cumulative burden or the peak magnitude of stress reaches the threshold required to render the impaired metabolic pathway clinically important.\n\nAutism could be increasing due to one or both of the following:\n\nThe stresses listed above are increasing in cumulative burden, such that they are increasingly likely to cross the threshold required to render a metabolic impairment clinically significant, and thus increasing the penetrance of the metabolic disorders.\n\nThe stresses listed above are increasing in cumulative burden, such that they are increasingly likely to cross the threshold required to render a metabolic impairment clinically significant, and thus increasing the penetrance of the metabolic disorders.\n\nThe stress listed above are becoming increasingly distributed in a temporal architecture that pulls the metabolic stress into period of time where the brain is vulnerable to autism pathogenesis.\n\nThe stress listed above are becoming increasingly distributed in a temporal architecture that pulls the metabolic stress into period of time where the brain is vulnerable to autism pathogenesis.\n\nThe current model of autism pathogenesis separates autism into two epochs:\n\nEpoch 1 starts early in pregnancy and continues till just before birth. This primarily involves a dysregulation in the formation of neurons, and the proliferation, migration, and fate of brain cells.\n\nEpoch 1 starts early in pregnancy and continues till just before birth. This primarily involves a dysregulation in the formation of neurons, and the proliferation, migration, and fate of brain cells.\n\nEpoch 2 starts late in the second trimester but continues until about 14 months of age. This primarily involves a dysregulation of synapse formation.\n\nEpoch 2 starts late in the second trimester but continues until about 14 months of age. This primarily involves a dysregulation of synapse formation.\n\nOther authors divide this up into a few more stages and extend the process to age four:\n\nThus, if the stresses listed above are temporally clustered into the period from the first trimester of pregnancy through 14 months of age (or four years of age), they will be far more likely to result in autism.\n\nIt is definitively not the case that there is a single point of failure where autism is suddenly switched from off to on. Rather, there is a period of 23 (or 58) months where autism is cumulatively progressed toward, hence the “spectrum” of autism disorders that can result.\n\nHowever, there can still be a single point where metabolic dysfunction precipitously deteriorates in response to a trigger and pushes the person over a final threshold of dysfunction that manifests to parents or caregivers as symptomatic onset.\n\nThe framework I advocate herein suggests that both infectious illnesses and vaccines could contribute to autism.\n\nThe Saudubray textbook only mentions vaccines contributing to the onset of metabolic disorders once, in the case of glutaric aciduria, a sometimes riboflavin-responsive disorder of lysine and tryptophan metabolism:\n\nAt a median age of 9–10 months, the majority of untreated patients suffer an acute brain injury, usually associated with febrile infectious disease, but this acute encephalopathic crisis may also be precipitated by any other episode that induces catabolism, including undesirable reactions following routine immunisations.\n\nAt a median age of 9–10 months, the majority of untreated patients suffer an acute brain injury, usually associated with febrile infectious disease, but this acute encephalopathic crisis may also be precipitated by any other episode that induces catabolism, including undesirable reactions following routine immunisations.\n\nA 2022 review identified case reports in the literature of 15 children for whom vaccinations precipitate the onset of inborn errors of metabolism.\n\nOne of them was a 3-month old girl whose glutaric aciduria was precipitated by a pentavalent vaccine for Hib, hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, who died of cardiac arrest four days later.\n\nIn another, a polio vaccine precipitated the onset of glutaric aciduria in a pair of identical twins but they survived.\n\nIn others, a disorder of cholesterol trafficking was precipitated by a BCG vaccine; a disorder of a salt- and potassium-dependent BCAA and ketone metabolism enzyme was precipitated by a Japanese encephalitis vaccine; a disorder of a B12-dependent enzyme in the metabolism of amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids was precipitated by a flu vaccine; a case of familial hypertriglyceridemia was precipitated by a Pfizer COVID vaccine; a disorder of carnitine-dependent fatty acid oxidation was precipitated by the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine; and a disorder of hereditary fructose intolerance was precipitated by a rotavirus vaccine.\n\nThey cite a paper from 2011 as showing that vaccination does not increase the amount of hospitalizations in children with inborn errors of metabolism. But that paper also shows that the “sickest” of these children have a 4.5-fold increased risk of hospitalization after vaccinations, and it includes two children who died in the month or two following a vaccine-associated metabolic deterioration.\n\nIt is more accepted that illness with a fever can trigger metabolic deterioration. For example, the Saudubray textbook mentions fevers in this context 86 times.\n\nFevers often go hand in hand with increased energetic demand, but the body heat itself can trigger the onset of a disorder caused by a thermolabile enzyme.\n\nVaccines can cause fevers, so if fevers can precipitate metabolic disorders, vaccines can precipitate them too.\n\nVaccines happen to be unique from other sources of fever in several respects:\n\nAll the common vaccines are injected. They purposefully skip over the potential for a non-inflammatory reaction to a low dose of pathogen in the mucosal membranes in favor of producing a high-dose systemic inflammatory response.\n\nAll the common vaccines are injected.

Few babies in history have otherwise ever gotten sick with five more illnesses at the same time.\n\nFurther, a lot of vaccines are given at prime autism pathogenesis time. CDC recommends pregnant women get vaccines for whooping cough, flu, RSV, COVID, and sometimes a few more. CDC recommends babies receive 25 or more vaccine doses in the first 14-15 months of life. These include 5-8 doses given at two months and 5-6 doses given at four months. Another 7-15 doses will be given by age four.\n\nPeter Hotez cites this study as showing no link between maternal flu vaccination and autism. However, the data show that flu vaccination in the first trimester increased autism risk by 26%:\n\nThey adjusted this for confounders till it dropped to 20%, then they multiplied the P value by a factor to account for making multiple comparisons of different trimesters, which made it lose statistical significance. But the straightforward interpretation of this study is that a flu vaccine in the first trimester mildly increases autism risk.\n\nAn oft-cited 2014 meta-analysis reviews the totality of the evidence that vaccines don’t cause autism. However, none of the papers look at cumulative vaccine burden and its relation to autism, nor timing of vaccine burden and its relation to autism. They instead look at thimerosal, mercury, or MMR, compared to their non-thimerosal, mercury-free, or monovalent measles, mumps, and rubella counterparts. This includes the massive Dutch study that was concerned with the MMR versus the monovalent versions of measles, mumps, and rubella.\n\nOne paper that kind of tried to tackle cumulative burden looked at total antigen exposure. However, because the whole-cell pertussis vaccine has far more antigens than any other, the study wound up just looking at whether someone had gotten the whole-cell pertussis vaccine instead of other pertussis vaccines.\n\nHotez and many others cite a macaque study that administered vaccines to monkeys without causing autism. However, the incidence of autism at the time of the study was one in 70. Each group had 12 monkeys, which gave it a 0.17% chance of observing one case of autism if the prevalence and mechanism were similar. Further, the macaques have a comprehensive genetic management plan to maintain their genetic health, but autistic children are enriched in inborn errors of metabolism. Thus, the study is too small and the population not vulnerable enough.\n\nAs noted in the Appendix, two case series and three case reports suggest that autism can onset very soon after vaccination in some children. This temporal association between vaccination and symptom onset has never been addressed in the many studies showing that “vaccines don’t cause autism” by which is meant “MMR and mercury vaccines don’t cause more autism than any other vaccines.”\n\nData from medical practices with liberal attitudes toward vaccination choice suggest parents who choose not to vaccinate have children with 4-fold to 5-fold lower rates of autism. In a self-described “control group” rejecting vitamin K shots and vaccines for both mother and child, zero cases of autism occurred in over 1000 children, whereas you would have expected 32 to occur according to the current average. That doesn’t mean unvaccinated children never develop autism. One reader commented on my Facebook page that she has a fully unvaccinated daughter diagnosed with level one autism. These are not random samples of the population, and there could be diagnostic bias exaggerating the trend.\n\nHowever, the total lack of rigorous data addressing whether total vaccine burden and timing of vaccine burden is associated with autism makes it absolutely necessary to entertain these preliminary reports until this question is addressed the way it finally should be.\n\nThe Study We Need\n\nHere is the research program that needs to be done to settle the vaccine question:\n\nThe United States HHS should organize a national randomized cluster trial of alternative vaccine schedules. Since there are other countries that vaccinate less than we do with no evidence of iller health, and since there are older US vaccine schedules at times that were not marked by increased childhood mortality, the study should compare more minimalist vaccine schedules to the current schedule. The unit of randomization could be hospitals, schools, or municipalities. Parents should have total choice about whether to withdraw from the study and follow the current schedule or no schedule. Those that deviate in either direction should have the opportunity to be studied as a free-choice side arm, and if they choose to be studied, details about their health choices should be tracked to asses for any cofounders in comparisons between groups.\n\nOther Research Priorities\n\nAll children with autism should undergo comprehensively metabolic screening and whole genome sequencing that has as its intent not necessarily to diagnose them with a metabolic disorder but rather to identify the most actionable limiting bottlenecks in their metabolism.\n\nNewborn screening for inborn errors should expand to look for signals of non-diagnosable partial metabolic impairments at birth and their ability to predict future autism.\n\nResearch should examine the role of all nutritional and toxic factors in the development of autism alongside all inflammatory factors (including infections and vaccines), and should place special emphasis on how these factors interact with rare metabolic disease genes as well as the common polymorphisms correlated with autism.\n\nPrevention is best initiated at the beginning of a pregnancy. Examining the primary metabolic impairments in a first child with autism and intervening to optimize nutrition around them starting in the next pregnancy has the potential to radically reduce the degree to which first-degree relatives share autism risk. This should be studied prospectively.\n\nAppendix: The MMR Controversy\n\nIn 1996, Fudenberg looked at 22 autistic children enrolled between 1984 and 1987 and examined the relation with maternal viral infection in the second trimester, multiple infections, especially ear infections, in the first 15 months of life, and the relation of onset to immunisations.\n\nFifteen out of them developed symptoms within one week of the MMR vaccine. Three of those fifteen had reacted to the vaccine with high fevers (up to 106F) and convulsions.\n\nTwenty of the 22 had antibodies to myelin; half had rubella titers that were more than ten times normal; almost half had anti-thyroid antibodies; half six had increased toxic metals, especially aluminum, and decreased trace metals in their hair; and several had evidence of having had measles more than twice, indicating an impaired immune response.\n\nIn two families, two of three siblings had autism, and chronic ear infections were found in the two affected siblings but not in the unaffected sibling.\n\nFudenberg proposed a model wherein some individuals are genetically predisposed, who are then exposed to high antibody titers in the mother that cross the placenta and are present at four weeks, and then are exposed tor a given virus, live virus vaccine, or DPT vaccine that causes an aberrant immune response, often driven by interaction between the antibodies obtained from the mother and the newly injected toxin present in the offending vaccine or viral infection They suggested that one strategy would be to identify the genetic predisposition, and then delay some of the most problematic vaccines to three years of age, since the immune system would be more developed and competent at that time in many children,.\n\nFudenberg had his medical license taken away in 1995, the year before his paper was published, for unrelated drug-hoarding charges that he denied. His paper was never retracted.\n\nLater in 1998 Wakefield and 11 co-authors famously reported that in 12 autistic children, eight had their onset within 24-48 hours, one week, or two weeks of the MMR vaccine, while one had a temporal association with measles infection and another had a temporal association with an ear infection.\n\nSix years later, in 2004 ten of the original twelve authors retracted the raising of the question of the possibility of a causal link between MMR vaccines and autism in view of the “major implications for public health” that made it “the appropriate time” to formally retract the question.\n\nThen, twelve years after the original paper was published, in 2010, the editors retracted the paper on the basis of the UK General Medical Council’s Fitness to Practice Panel on January 28, 2010, finding that the children studied in the paper were not “consecutively referred,” nor were the investigations “approved” by the local ethics committee.\n\nThis panel purported to refute the statement that the children were “consecutively referred to the department of paediatric gastroenterology with a history of a pervasive developmental disorder with loss of acquired skills and intestinal symptoms (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating and food intolerance).” They said this implied a “routine referral process” in which the children were referred because of gastrointestinal symptoms and in which the investigators played no part, when in fact four children were referred to look at the link between MMR and autism and Wakefield played a role in the referral of two of those children and two others. They considered this “irresponsible,” “misleading,” and “contrary to your duty to ensure the information in the paper was accurate.”\n\nThe disputation of ethics approval focused on the fact that 1) the recruitment process for several children had evidence of being de facto initiated prior to the approval date of December 18, 1996, and 2) several children’s gastrointestinal problems were not sufficient to merit a diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease and therefore did not meet the inclusion criteria of “symptoms and signs of intestinal disease or dysfunction namely pain, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhoea, steatorrhoea and failure to thrive.”\n\nInvestigative reporting by Brian Deer — who was largely responsible for provoking the convening fitness to practice panel — published in the British Medical Journal identified additional discrepancies. Three children didn’t have autism: two had Asperger’s or possible Asperger’s, one turned out not to have any diagnosis. Five had variable evidence of behavioral abnormality or metabolic dysfunction predating the vaccine. In one case, the child had a facial deformity, indicating metabolic dysfunction that may have started in utero. Deer talked to two parents who indicated the onset of autism was substantially different from what was in the paper: one wanted Wakefield’s license revoked; the other complained that Deer was using “gutter press” tactics to get her to change her story. Most of the parents had some relation to anti-vaccine ideas, with 11 of 12 having blamed the MMR vaccine themselves in the hospital.\n\nThe panel also argued Wakefield failed to disclose conflicts of interest, including a lawsuit and business ventures related to his research, and that his group subjected children to unnecessary medical procedures. These findings, however, were not included as reasons for the Lancet retraction.\n\nThere are certainly legitimate questions around Wakefield’s procedural appropriateness, conflicts of interest, and motivations, and it is unlikely all of the data in the paper are completely accurate. However, the retraction of the paper had nothing to do with the temporal association between the autism onset and the MMR vaccines.\n\nDeer’s contention that the temporal association falls apart when there is evidence of preexisting metabolic or behavioral dysfunction in five of the children does not hold up if we use a multifactorial model that involves various opportunities to cross thresholds of metabolic dysfunction, where crossing a certain threshold at the right time of development results in autism.\n\nFudenberg’s paper had a larger sample size and never had a retraction at all. Deer gives Fudenberg a small paragraph in his BMJ series and never questions the details of his paper.\n\nSo, there are two case series suggesting this temporal association and no clear refutation of it.\n\nA spattering of case reports continued to roll in suggesting vaccines sometimes precipitate autism onset:\n\nA 2008 case report noted onset of autism and precipitous metabolic decline “within 48 hours after immunizations to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; Haemophilus influenzae B; measles, mumps, and rubella; polio; and varicella (Varivax).”\n\nA 2008 case report noted onset of autism and precipitous metabolic decline “within 48 hours after immunizations to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; Haemophilus influenzae B; measles, mumps, and rubella; polio; and varicella (Varivax).”\n\nA 2013 case report noted autism onset with language regression from the 4-year to 18-month level ”immediately after her 4-year-old well child visit.” While this paper doesn’t say anything about vaccines, the four-year well-child visit typically involves DTaP, polio, MMR, chicken pox, hep A, and now according to CDC COVID and varicella vaccines.\n\nA 2013 case report noted autism onset with language regression from the 4-year to 18-month level ”immediately after her 4-year-old well child visit.” While this paper doesn’t say anything about vaccines, the four-year well-child visit typically involves DTaP, polio, MMR, chicken pox, hep A, and now according to CDC COVID and varicella vaccines.\n\nA 2017 case report notes that a child had no developmental problems at the 14-month well-child visit but the parents reported regression over the course of months 15 to 19, which doesn’t have a clear “immediate” relation to the 14-month visit, but was in the wake of a visit that likely included vaccinations for RSV, hep A and B, DTaP, pneumococcus, polio, MMR and varicella.\n\nA 2017 case report notes that a child had no developmental problems at the 14-month well-child visit but the parents reported regression over the course of months 15 to 19, which doesn’t have a clear “immediate” relation to the 14-month visit, but was in the wake of a visit that likely included vaccinations for RSV, hep A and B, DTaP, pneumococcus, polio, MMR and varicella.\n\nMuch has been made of the Wakefield retraction as if the entire idea of a temporal association between the MMR vaccine and autism onset was proven fraudulent. But the Wakefield attraction had nothing to do with the temporal data, even though Deer questioned it in his article, and no one ever refuted or retracted the Fudenberg data, which made the same suggestion two years earlier with a larger sample size.\n\nThe possibility for a vaccination to acutely provoke autism onset is consistent with my model where a certain magnitude of stress can push an individual across the threshold into metabolic deterioration. This was not the singular start of autism. Events beginning prenatally and continuing up to that point built up the predisposition. The vaccine was just the straw that broke the camel’s back. But its occurrence within the window of time where autism onset is relevant gave it permanent significance to that individual’s health trajectory.\n\nSubtitle: It's genetic. It's environmental.

    "title": "Can Hiking Increase Testosterone?",
    "content": "In Five Ways to Increase Testosterone Naturally, I wrote about how properly dosed hypoxia training can increase testosterone up to 31%.\n\nIt appears from animal experiments that too much hypoxia can tank testosterone.\n\nThe most successful trial used simulation of 2000 meters (~6500 feet) 11-12 hours a day three days a week for four weeks. Testosterone went up by 31% and stayed elevated until the protocol was stopped.\n\nDoing the protocol every day instead of three times a week led to a much lower rise in testosterone that did not reach statistical significance.\n\nAnother study simulated 2500 meters (~8200 feet) every day for 11 days. Testosterone increased at the 20-hour mark but this increase had started to return toward baseline by day 5 and lost significance by the end.\n\nThis indicates that 6500-8000 feet of altitude begins exceeding maximally valuable stimulus after about five straight days.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the cumulative stimulus over time and the intervening recovery period is what matters, it may be that three sessions per week of 11-12 hours 6500 feet can be condensed into 5-6 days per month.\n\nThus, it may be that 5-6 days per month spent hiking, skiing, snowboarding, or doing whatever you want at the top of a mountain about 6500 feet above sea level is a great way to leverage a long-term rise in testosterone.\n\nIn nine recovering male drug addicts and 17 controls, 25 days spent in hiking Taiwan’s Central Mountain Ridge increased testosterone. Here the “controls” control from recovering drug addict status and not for the intervention. The recovering drug addicts improved their body composition but the controls did not. Both experienced a rise in testosterone, but the addicts more than the controls, possibly due to a positive effect of the exercise on body composition:\n\nIt is not clear what altitude the subjects were resting in, but they spent eight to nine hours a day hiking at 2200-3800 meters (~7200-12,500 feet). Resting time could have been anywhere from sea level to 1200 meters (4000 feet).\n\nWhen over 100 subjects were transported by airplane from 500 meters (1640 feet) to 3700 meters (~12,000 feet), there testosterone went up after the first day but declined by day 7:\n\nWhen ten healthy men were exposed to 11 days at 2040 meters (~6700 feet), their testosterone was increased by day seven but had started declining by day 9:\n\nWhen ten healthy men were brought from Ann Arbor, Michigan to the top of Pike’s Peak, Colorado at 4300 meters (14,100 feet) for six days, their testosterone went up the whole time but it wasn’t statistically significant:\n\nStill, it is 22% higher at the end.\n\nWhen ten men had their salivary testosterone at different times of day compared to sea level (SL), one week of 3450 meters (11,000 feet) (SJ), six months of altitude (ALL), or to those of ten high-altitude natives (HAN), 7 days of altitude seemed to trash noon-time testosterone, while six months seemed to create a high-testosterone rebound, and the high-altitude natives seemed to have intermediate testosterone. Salivary testosterone is thought to reflect the free testosterone and is therefore thought to be influenced by sex hormone-binding globulin, and not just total testosterone output.\n\nWhen high-altitude-living men and low-altitude-living men in Peru had their urinary testosterone compared, it started out at a similar level, but the sea level subjects had much greater response to injections of hCG.\n\nIn Finnish cross-country skiers and biathalonists, spending 8-15 days at 1650 meters (~5400 feet) increased resting testosterone by 19%.\n\nThe most robust inference is that intermittent altitude increases testosterone, but there comes a point where too much altitude causes a loss of the benefit.\n\nTestosterone is probably highest when intermittent altitude exposure is matched with sufficient recovery time at lower altitude.\n\nThe magnitude of the altitude stress probably makes a big difference:\n\nFor 1650 meters/5400 feet, 8-15 days in a row produces a net benefit.\n\nFor 1650 meters/5400 feet, 8-15 days in a row produces a net benefit.\n\nFor 2040 meters/6700 feet, 7 days in a row appears to be the maximal tolerable stress.\n\nFor 2040 meters/6700 feet, 7 days in a row appears to be the maximal tolerable stress.\n\nFor 3700 meters/12,000 feet, one day produces benefit and there is net loss by seven days.\n\nFor 3700 meters/12,000 feet, one day produces benefit and there is net loss by seven days.\n\nThe Taiwan hiking expedition showed benefit extending to 25 days, but the altitude exposure was gradually increased over 8-9 hours a day of hiking and the altitude at rest was unclear. Further, the best benefit is in the recovering drug addicts where part of the benefit came from improved body composition.\n\nThe Taiwan hiking expedition showed benefit extending to 25 days, but the altitude exposure was gradually increased over 8-9 hours a day of hiking and the altitude at rest was unclear. Further, the best benefit is in the recovering drug addicts where part of the benefit came from improved body composition.\n\nThe controlled studies cited at the beginning imply that the robust 31% increase in testosterone experienced with ~33-36 hours per week of 2000 meters/6500 feet can be carried on indefinitely, while 2500 meters/8200 feet every single day starts losing benefit after five consecutive days.\n\nThe controlled studies cited at the beginning imply that the robust 31% increase in testosterone experienced with ~33-36 hours per week of 2000 meters/6500 feet can be carried on indefinitely, while 2500 meters/8200 feet every single day starts losing benefit after five consecutive days.\n\nThe long-term adaptations as shown in saliva and urine probably reflect free testosterone and adaptations involving sex-hormone binding globulin. My guess is testosterone production is compromised at long-term high altitude, and declines in sex-hormone binding globulin step in to mitigate this.\n\nTherefore, the most evidence-based protocol is to spend three 11- to 12-hour events at 2000 meters/6500 feet per week.\n\nBut the most plausible adaptation that would potentially be dramatically more fun and rewarding is to spend 5-6 days per month spent hiking, skiing, snowboarding, or doing whatever you want at the top of a mountain at 5,000-8,000 feet above sea level.\n\nDescription: In Five Ways to Increase Testosterone Naturally, I wrote about how properly dosed hypoxia training can increase testosterone up to 31%.",

    "title": "Sauna vs. Homocysteine",
    "content": "Many rare disease genes and even some very common genetic polymorphisms hurt enzyme function because the make the enzymes “thermolabile,\" which means that body heat is “too hot” for the enzyme and denatures it the way more intense heat would denature any other protein.\n\nOften this causes small changes to the shape of the protein that alters its affinity for a nutritional cofactor. The enzyme then becomes more likely to lose the cofactor, and the loss of the cofactor further destabilizes it and makes it permanently denature.\n\nIn such cases, maintaining high levels of the nutritional cofactor can increase the stability of the enzyme.\n\nThis is true with the infamous MTHFR C677T polymorphism, of which 55% of the world’s population has at least one copy.\n\nMuch of the basic research around this enzyme is done in an E coli model, because it is easier to systematically study. This model originally showed that C677T causes MTHFR to thermally destabilize and lose the riboflavin cofactor more effectively, and that both riboflavin and folate can help prevent it from destabilizing.\n\n1.6 extra milligrams of riboflavin, bringing total intake up to 3.2 milligrams per day, abolishes the effect of C667T on homocysteine in humans.\n\nWell, guess what else fixes this polymorphism? According to the E. coli model, heat shock proteins! This suggests that interventions to increase heat shock proteins, such as sauna, could benefit MTHFR.\n\nBut hold up — we will see soon that sauna has an acute effect on heat shock proteins, not a long term one.\n\nAnd what about COLD? If the heat of body temperature is too much for this enzyme, don’t we want to stay cool rather than hot? Wouldn’t sauna hurt, at least temporarily? Should we be cold plunging instead? We will see below that we can actually leverage sauna to cool the body if we do it right.\n\nCOMT is another example. This enzyme uses methylation to support mental flexibility and to prevent excessive rumination. About 25% of the population is homozygous for the “slow” version (Val158Met) and 50% is heterozygous. Slow COMT is associated with anxiety and depression, but with good academic performance. The “slow” version is thermolabile, and is stabilized by S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM or SAMe), the universal methyl donor.\n\nThe rs1126809 R402Q allele of tyrosinase (TYR) is yet another example. This is likely a major driver of gray hair. It is very common in people with European ancestry, where just under 40% of people are heterozygous and 7.6% are homozygous. It is not found in many Asians. It is found in American Blacks and Latin Americans, but not in African pygmies or Australian Aborigines, leading to speculation that it arose in Caucasians and spread to other groups through admixture. Thermolability causes body heat to loosen its hold on the copper cofactor. Being copper deficient probably makes this worse, but, due to the toxicity of copper overload, it is not clear whether it is safe to supplement with extra copper the way you want to get extra riboflavin for MTHFR.\n\nOne of the most fascinating cases of thermolability is the cystic fibrosis mutation, a deletion in CFTR at F508 (rs113993960), which only 0.6% of the world’s population carries. This mutation makes the protein responsible for preventing cystic fibrosis thermolabile. The deletion at F508 is the most common cystic fibrosis mutation. Generally cystic fibrosis cohorts are 50% homozygous for this deletion, but another 40% are heterozygous and may have a less common mutation alongside it.\n\nThe mean annual temperature where a cystic fibrosis patient resides is a predictor of lung function, such that each 10F (5.6C) increase in temperature is associated with a 3% loss in lung function. When this mutation is engineered into mice, taking their cells and incubating them at 26C (79F), instead of body temperature, leads to between 50% and 100% restoration of function. In another study, mice with this deletion had their temperature set point chemically lowered with a chemical injection, then were kept at air temperatures of 15-17C (59-63F). Whole-body cooling partially reversed much of the pathology, improving mucous cell presence and salivary flow, and moderately reducing mortality. Altogether this does not support using whole-body cooling as a cure for cystic fibrosis but it does support environmental temperature as a causal modifier of the disease severity.\n\nWhether we can “cure” the common polymorphisms in MTHFR, COMT, and TYR is a different story. These are, first of all, common traits in the population and not diseases requiring a cure. But the fact that a little extra riboflavin abolishes the impact of C677T on methylation as judged by homocysteine levels suggests that totally abolishing the effect of any of these polymorphisms could be in reach.\n\nMTHFR C677T and COMT Val158Met correlate positively with latitude. This and the concentration TYR R402Q in Europeans suggests that the cold climates humans experienced as we migrated out of Africa and into the ice age-dominated global north could have allowed the thermolabile variants to spread. This, then, suggests that for those of us with these common polymorphisms, our mental health, our blood cell synthesis, the development of healthy babies, and our graying hair are all screaming at us to get into the cool temperatures that our bodies were designed for.\n\nIn trying to hack our way out of the fates imposed by these variants, we need to be careful to distinguish between environmental temperature, acute temperature stress from saunas and cold plunges, and the counter-productive drop in body temperature that can be caused by a lower metabolic rate.\n\nWe do not want to do anything that would lower ATP levels, because ATP fuels the activity of heat shock proteins, is needed to make methylfolate, and is needed to activate methionine to S-adenosyl-methionine, the universal methyl donor. So we don’t want to just tank our metabolic rate to improve the function of these enzymes.\n\nThe protocol I advocate for this could be called sauna hard and stay cool.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. Any products linked herein may be affiliate links. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThe sauna hard and stay cool protocol is as follows:\n\nSauna 30-60 minutes anywhere from once every two days to twice a day, at 80-100C (176-212F) and 30-40% humidity.\n\nSauna 30-60 minutes anywhere from once every two days to twice a day, at 80-100C (176-212F) and 30-40% humidity.\n\nMen should keep their testicles wrapped in ice packs in the sauna.\n\nMen should keep their testicles wrapped in ice packs in the sauna.\n\nKeep your house as cool as you can tolerate, down to 15.5 C (60 F).

You could suffer heat stroke or if you have a severe thermolabile genetic mutation sauna could induce metabolic harm. Work your way up to the heat and humidity recommended here to make sure you tolerate it. Make sure to stay hydrated and get your salt and other electrolytes replaced.\n\nUse the sauna hard and stay cool protocol to test blood levels of homocysteine, the methylation index on the Dutch Complete test (which measures the methylation of estrogen by COMT), or the grayness of your hair.\n\nIt should take at least seven sauna sessions to reach maximal adaptation, and the adaptations can likely be lost within 2-3 days.\n\nA reduction in homocysteine or an increased Dutch methylation index should be apparent within a week of this protocol.\n\nHair graying is impacted toward the middle of a very long cycle of hair growth. Treatments that induce re-pigmentation take at least one month, often six to twelve months, and sometimes up to two years.\n\nFor homocysteine and the methylation index, the timescale on which you would expect this to work could be short enough that you could perform a rigorous randomized controlled trial on yourself. Briefly, do a series of measurements to verify that the effect appears to be maximized at one to two weeks (or whatever you find). Wherever the effect is maximal, this is the duration of each experiment. Use a random number generator or some other method to randomize periods of that length to either sauna hard and stay cool or control. Do at least three measurements of each. Further guidance can be found in How to Do a Proper Self-Experiment, and Why Your “N” Doesn’t Technically Equal “1”\n\nYou don’t have to do a randomized experiment. You can just try it and see if it seems to work.\n\nFor hair graying, you need to persist for at least a month and possibly much longer, so in this case you want to just stick with it if you like it and feel good on it and wait to see if it works.\n\nKeep your diet and exercise regimen as consistent as possible across the length of your experiment.\n\nOnce you have results, come back here and post them in the comments!\n\nNow we turn to the justification for the sauna hard and stay cool protocol.\n\nIn this section we will learn the following:\n\nYour environment determines your body temperature.\n\nYour environment determines your body temperature.\n\nLong-term adaptation with extreme cold exposure can lower body temperature further, but requires high volumes of discomfort that go beyond any cold plunge protocol that has been studied.\n\nLong-term adaptation with extreme cold exposure can lower body temperature further, but requires high volumes of discomfort that go beyond any cold plunge protocol that has been studied.\n\nSauna is the most effective way to lower resting core body temperature while benefiting rather than hurting the metabolic rate.\n\nSauna is the most effective way to lower resting core body temperature while benefiting rather than hurting the metabolic rate.\n\nHeat-shock proteins seem to be a temporary adjustment that become irrelevant once the long-term adaptations to sauna settle in.\n\nHeat-shock proteins seem to be a temporary adjustment that become irrelevant once the long-term adaptations to sauna settle in.\n\nThe “stay cool” part of this should increase your metabolic rate, an extra boost.\n\nThe “stay cool” part of this should increase your metabolic rate, an extra boost.\n\nYour Environment Determines Your Body Temperature\n\nYour Environment Determines Your Body Temperature\n\nExtreme Cold Exposure Causes Long-Term Decreases in Body Temperature That Have Never Been Replicated in Cold Plunge Studies\n\nExtreme Cold Exposure Causes Long-Term Decreases in Body Temperature That Have Never Been Replicated in Cold Plunge Studies\n\nSauna Lowers Resting Body Temperature\n\nSauna Lowers Resting Body Temperature\n\nExercise Can But Doesn’t Always Replicate Sauna Heat, And Never Replicates the Decrease in Resting Temperature\n\nExercise Can But Doesn’t Always Replicate Sauna Heat, And Never Replicates the Decrease in Resting Temperature\n\nWhy Do Exercise and Sauna Differ?\n\nWhy Do Exercise and Sauna Differ?\n\nWhat About Heat Shock Proteins?\n\nWhat About Heat Shock Proteins?\n\nWill Sauna Wreck Your Energy Metabolism?\n\nWill Sauna Wreck Your Energy Metabolism?\n\nCaveat: Sauna Can Probably Wreck Your Sperm Without Ice\n\nCaveat: Sauna Can Probably Wreck Your Sperm Without Ice\n\nWhile we are warm-blooded animals and therefore regulate our own body temperature, all such regulation is incomplete.\n\nWhen comparing 60 hours spent at 16C/60.8F to the same time spent at 22C/71.6F, rectal temperature is about 0.6C (2.52F) lower. This comes with a 6% increase in the metabolic rate.\n\nThis is when they stay in energy balance. When they overeat, they can cut the drop in core temperature in half by pushing their metabolic rate up to a 10% gain, but this still constitutes a 0.3C drop in core temperature.\n\nIn four European physicians who moved to India in 1976, prior to the spread of residential air conditioning, rectal temperatures increased from 36.8C to 37.6C after three weeks, while they were 37.8C in Indians. The fact that their temperatures rose almost as high as the Indians in just three weeks suggests that the environment was more important than genetics, and that there are no long-term adaptations to mitigate the effect of the environment.\n\nIn the winter of 1958, the arctic-adapted Norwegian Saami had lower rectal temperatures than the research team, who were from various European countries and used themselves as controls. The Saami were divided between nomadic shepherd-hunters who were accustomed to sleeping outside in the cold, protected only by tents, and villagers, who slept inside in houses. Upon arriving to the laboratory for an experiment described in the next section, the rectal temperatures were 37.3C for the researchers, 36.9C for the villagers, and 36.5C for the nomads.\n\nThe first study showed a 16C environment brought resting body temperature down to 36.4. When this is compared to the 37.8 found in Indians, it suggests at least a 1.4C spread is considered “tolerated” by the body sufficiently to avoid any adaptation.\n\nThe largest study to date on the seasonal variation in body temperature used 93,225 temporal artery temperatures taken at the point of triage at the Beth Israel Deaconess emergency department in Boston, where winter temperatures were on average 0.2C lower than summer temperatures.\n\nIn 103 soliders in Senegal, mean rectal temperatures were 0.2C higher in summer than winter.\n\nIn a single individual who took her own oral temperature for 30 years, her winter temperatures were 0.15C lower than her summer temperatures.\n\nIn ten male Japanese volunteers, rectal temperatures during one summer were 0.15-27C higher than in two different winters.\n\nIn 26 male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 24, females had higher temperatures than males during summer months but not winter months, and there were no other statistically significant differences. The impression this gives is that temperatures were higher in summer than winter due to the jump up in female temperatures, but the statistics cannot robustly support this interpretation.\n\nAt least two studies disagree:\n\nIn 18 seasonal affective disorder patients and matched controls, rectal temperatures were slightly higher in the winter than the summer. They were taken every five minutes for 24 hours, beginning 2 hours after entry into the hospital.\n\nIn 18 seasonal affective disorder patients and matched controls, rectal temperatures were slightly higher in the winter than the summer. They were taken every five minutes for 24 hours, beginning 2 hours after entry into the hospital.\n\nIn twenty men and women between the ages of 19 and 36 living in the Netherlands, rectal temperature and temperature measured with a swallowed thermometer pill indicated that core body temperature was not statistically significantly different between the end of the summer and the end of winter, but the average temperature was 0.1C higher in winter (36.9 vs 36.8). These measurements were taken after subjects stayed overnight in the lab kept at 22C and had fasted for ten hours.\n\nIn twenty men and women between the ages of 19 and 36 living in the Netherlands, rectal temperature and temperature measured with a swallowed thermometer pill indicated that core body temperature was not statistically significantly different between the end of the summer and the end of winter, but the average temperature was 0.1C higher in winter (36.9 vs 36.8). These measurements were taken after subjects stayed overnight in the lab kept at 22C and had fasted for ten hours.\n\nMy impression of these latter two studies is that having the person equilibrate to the hospital or lab’s controlled temperature is taking out the effect of the environmental temperature. If the metabolic rate goes up in winter due to incomplete compensation for the colder environmental temperature, then if you standardize the environmental temperature in which the measurements are taken, you are starting to look at the compensation, rather than the natural real-world result.\n\nThe massive dataset from the Beth Israel emergency room is vastly greater than all other data combined, and having the temperatures taken “at the point of triage” allows enough spontaneity to allow the effect of the real-world environment to assert its dominance.\n\nIn conclusion, body temperatures are about 0.2C (0.36F) colder in winter than in summer.\n\nHowever, this is clearly driven by the fact that we collectively keep our homes warm in the winter.\n\nThe first study suggests that if you lower your home temperature from 22C/71.6F to 16C/60.8F to, your body temperature will drop 0.6C (1.08F), not 0.2C — providing you do not bundle up in many layers or overeat to negate the effect.\n\nLong-term adaptations to cold include an increased metabolic rate, and increased insulation, partly driven by increased subcutaneous fat and partly driven by unknown mechanisms. However, these never lead to complete compensation of body temperature, and adaptations to the extreme cold appear to include the body defending a lower body temperature rather than a higher one.\n\nWhether this is due to increased cold tolerance of cells from relatively recently discovered “cold-shock proteins” or due to poorly understood redirection of heat towards certain prioritized tissues, or to changes in membrane composition to increase PUFA content and maintain optimal fluidity at lower temperatures is unclear. But, with enough stimulus from repeated heavy cold exposure, you will lower your core body temperature even further than your environment would dictate.\n\nIn the winter of 1958, as introduced earlier, the arctic-adapted Norwegian Saami were divided into villagers that slept in homes and nomads that slept in outdoor tents, and compared to European researchers who lived in then-modern housing. Upon arriving to the laboratory for a cold exposure experiment, the rectal temperatures were 37.3C for the researchers, 36.9C for the villagers, and 36.5C for the nomads. After 8 hours in a sleeping bag in a room kept at 0C, the rectal temperatures of the researchers (36.4C) and villagers (36.5C) were nearly identical, while those of the nomads dropped further to 36.0C.\n\nThis suggests that regular exposure of the nomads to the intensity of the overnight outdoor temperatures led to a specific adaptation to reach a colder core body temperature upon exposure to the same extreme cold.\n\nThe fact that the villagers did not attain any colder temperatures under these conditions than the researchers indicates that simply living in an environment cold enough to bring down your resting core body temperature does not induce long-term adaptation. The intensity of the cold found in the overnight outdoor sleeping is needed to induce long-term adaptation.\n\nThis suggests that, with sufficient purposeful training, the tolerable core body temperature can be expanded to a 1.8C (3.24F)-wide range from 36.0-37.8C (96.8-100.4F).\n\nIn 1963, the Ama diving women of Korea developed an increased metabolic rate during the winter that other Korean women did not. Their oral temperatures were not statistically significantly different at rest, though they seemed to be 0.2-0.3C higher in the colder months. However, their oral temperatures were 1.8C lower after diving shifts in January than in June, even though they were only able to dive for about 20 minutes instead of 2.5 hours.\n\nThus, the non-significant slightly lower resting temperature in summer could be due to spending eight times longer submerged in cold water rather than due to the higher ambient temperature. The water temperature was just slightly over 25C at the warmest time and about 10C at the coldest time. This suggests that multiple 2.5-hour exposures to 25C (77F) water are more effective than 20-minute exposures at 10C (50F)\n\nWhen synthesized with the effect of the Saami nomads sleeping in outdoor tents in the arctic, it appears that considerable duration of a sufficiently intense stimulus is needed for the extra drop in body temperature.\n\nThe Ama had greater insulation, defined by less heat evolving from their body. This could not be accounted for by increased subcutaneous fat or vasoconstriction to the skin, and was speculated to be due to an unknown mechanism for evolving heat deep into their core rather than to the periphery of their body.\n\nAll of their metabolic adaptations disappeared after they started using wet suits in 1977.\n\nIn a classic study of 16 healthy men with a mean age in the mid 20s, rectal temperature was measured during 31 days of cold air exposure at 11.8C (53.2F) for eight hours per day at the end of winter and summer. At the end of winter, rectal temperature declined from 37.27 to 36.7 during the cold exposure. At the end of summer, it declined from 37.3 to 36.4 during 31 days of 13.5C. These appear to be the averages of temperatures taken at 2-hour intervals during the cold exposure, so this might reflect progressive drops in the cold-exposed temperatures rather than in the baseline temperatures. This is the only published study showing declines in cold-exposed temperatures during repeated cold exposure protocols, which suggests that the duration of eight hours per day is an important part of why some adaptation was shown.\n\nRepeated cold exposure protocols in the literature have never been able to show a long-term reduction in resting core body temperature as found in the Saami and as seemingly found in the Ama, nor any reduction in cold-exposed temperature as shown in the study just mentioned:\n\nIn 17 male and female subjects with a mean age of 23, ten days of 2-6 hours of cold air at 15-16C (59-61F) had no effect whatsoever on resting core body temperature as measured by a swallowed thermometer pill (37.0 vs 37.0). The cold period lasted two hours on the first day, four hours the second day, and six hours thereafter. At first, the exposure period caused a 0.1C drop in core temperature but by the end it had no effect.\n\nIn 17 male and female subjects with a mean age of 23, ten days of 2-6 hours of cold air at 15-16C (59-61F) had no effect whatsoever on resting core body temperature as measured by a swallowed thermometer pill (37.0 vs 37.0). The cold period lasted two hours on the first day, four hours the second day, and six hours thereafter. At first, the exposure period caused a 0.1C drop in core temperature but by the end it had no effect.\n\nIn 14 healthy active men with a mean age of 21, 5 weeks of daily one-hour submersions in 20C (68F) water led to an acute 0.8C drop in rectal temperature during the cold plunge but led to no change in resting temperature or response to the plunge at the end of five weeks.\n\nIn 14 healthy active men with a mean age of 21, 5 weeks of daily one-hour submersions in 20C (68F) water led to an acute 0.8C drop in rectal temperature during the cold plunge but led to no change in resting temperature or response to the plunge at the end of five weeks.\n\nSimilarly, in ten young healthy men with a mean age of 22.5, 100 minutes of 10C cold air per day for ten consecutive days dropped rectal temperature by 0.4C during the cold exposure but caused no changes in resting or cold-exposed rectal temperature over the ten days.\n\nSimilarly, in ten young healthy men with a mean age of 22.5, 100 minutes of 10C cold air per day for ten consecutive days dropped rectal temperature by 0.4C during the cold exposure but caused no changes in resting or cold-exposed rectal temperature over the ten days.\n\nYet again, in seven healthy active men with a mean age of 25, a cold water adaptation protocol of 18.1C water and 21.3C air for 90 minutes over 15 days did not change resting or cold-exposed rectal temperature.\n\nYet again, in seven healthy active men with a mean age of 25, a cold water adaptation protocol of 18.1C water and 21.3C air for 90 minutes over 15 days did not change resting or cold-exposed rectal temperature.\n\n12 healthy, physically active men with a mean age of 25 were randomized to either a control group or to four 12-minute sessions per week in a 7C (44.6F) cold plunge for three weeks. Unfortunately this is the only study I can find of cold plunges with water temperatures under 10C (50F) and the only study of repeat immersion with water temperatures under 18C (64F), but it did not measure the effect on core body temperature.\n\nSimilarly, in the well-popularized study showing that cold plunging after strength training blunts hypertrophy-related adaptations in muscle, 10 minutes of a 10C cold plunge was tested twice a week over 12 weeks, making this by far the longest repeat cold plunge study, but body temperature was not measured.\n\nThus, while there are many potential benefits of properly dosed cold plunging for mood and cognitive function, there is zero evidence that any currently used cold plunge protocol leads to the long-term adaptations affecting core body temperature best exemplified by the Saami nomads and seemingly demonstrated by the Ama divers prior to their adoption of wet suits. Long-term adaptations to cold exposure that will lower core body temperature require intense discomfort that you are probably unwilling to experience.\n\nIt is actually much easier to lower your core body temperature with sauna.\n\nIn ten healthy males aged 19-22 years, 1 hour of 80C Finnish sauna at 35-38% humidity twice a day for seven days led to a linear decline in core body temperature with each successive session:\n\nThe resting rectal temperature (“before”) declined by 1.1C from 37.7 to 36.6, becoming statistically significantly different beginning on the sixth day.\n\nThe post-sauna rectal temperature, while always higher than the pre-sauna temperature, declined by 0.5C from 38.5 to 38.0, becoming statistically significantly different on the fourth day.\n\nIn 29 healthy males with mean ages in their early 20s, nine sessions of Finnish sauna at 100C and 20-30% relative humidity, each consisting of three 10-minute sauna intervals interspersed by 5-minute breaks, oral temperature appeared to decline with repeated use, although the data are slightly noisier in this study:\n\nFocusing on “after” in set 1 of the control experimental group (EG) in the upper left, and tracing this down through each session (S1-S9), we see that temperature generally declines in each session. The ending value, however, is higher than sessions 5 and 8 but approximately the same as session 4. The session 8 value is statistically significantly lower than the session 1 value, but the session 9 value is not.\n\nThe “after” set 3 value barely moves across the sessions.\n\nThis same group did an earlier study with the same sauna protocol, except that it included a two bouts of cycling to exhaustion, one with and one without heat stress, at the beginning and end of the protocol. In this study they did not take measurements across five sessions, but only before and after the exercise bouts at the beginning and end. The ending non-heated core body temperature before exercise was slightly but non-significantly higher at the end (36.54C) than at the beginning (36.21C). However, this is probably confounded by regression to the mean, because the beginning value in the sauna group was actually statistically significantly lower than that in the control group (36.77C).\n\nOver all, nearly all other studies performed indicate a clear decrease in core body temperature after repeated use of heat stress, but of lower magnitude than shown in the first study.\n\nIn a randomized crossover study of 13 male and female moderately fit but heat-naive participants with a mean age of 23, five days in a row of hot water immersion (HWI), sauna, or heated exercise (ExH) led to a day-by-day decrease in rectal temperature, while the regular water control (TWI) did not:\n\nEach trial was separated by at least four weeks. The authors unfortunately do not report the absolute rectal temperatures, only the change. They also do not report whether there was a downward effect on temperature over the course of the four trials.\n\nHowever, given that the magnitudes of decrease from day 1 through day 6 are similar between the trials, it is difficult to imagine that the temperatures did not recover to baseline during the four weeks between the trials.\n\nIn 27 male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 30, those allocated to hot water immersion had their post-immersion core body temperature decrease statistically significantly by 0.2C from 38.5C to 38.3C after eight weeks of four to five sessions per week. The intervention was immersion in 40.5C water for 25-30 minutes. The authors did not report the effect on their resting core body temperature.\n\nIn 20 trained male and female runners randomized to three weeks of low-intensity outdoor running with or without 30 minutes of 101-108C sauna at 5-10% relative humidity, resting rectal temperature was not reported, but peak rectal temperature after training/sauna was 0.2C lower in the sauna group than in the control group.\n\nSix male and female subjects with a mean age of 25 were subjected to 4 hours of sauna at 46C and 20% humidity for nine consecutive days. Their morning rectal temperature went down from 37.09 to 37.0C, but the change was not statistically significant. The afternoon rectal temperature statistically significantly declined by 0.19C from 37.17 to 36.98C.\n\nTwelve, healthy, university-aged males were allocated (not randomly, apparently) to incremental cycling from rest to exhaustion after ten days of either sauna or control. The sauna was two hours a day of 50C at 20% relative humidity. Resting esophageal temperature declined 0.25C from 37.57C to 37.32C.\n\nIn 11 healthy males with a mean age of 25, seven consecutive days of mild heat acclimation for six hours a day at up to 37.5C led to a decrease in oral temperature of 0.12-0.14C, which was statistically significant when measured during the heating period but not in the unheated state.\n\nIn 10 recreationally active males, six days of 40-minute treadmill running at 65% of VO2max followed by up to 40 minutes of hot water immersion at 40C led to a 0.3C decline in resting rectal temperature from 37.0 to 36.7C.\n\n13 healthy males and females with a mean age of 23 were allocated (not randomly, apparently) to a control or to seven sessions, carried out every other day for two weeks, involving 45 minutes of immersion up to the waste in 44C hot water. In the hot water immersion group, resting rectal temperature declined by 0.3C from 37.5C to 37.2C.\n\nIn six healthy males with a mean age of 23, nine days in a row of heat acclimation bringing ear temperature up to 37.5C for 100 minutes using a combination of hot water immersion and a heated blanket caused resting ear temperature to decline 0.25C from 36.76 to 36.51C.\n\nIn five healthy males with a mean age of 25, 5 days a week for just under 3 weeks of heat acclimation by keeping ear temperature at 38.5C for one hour did not appear to reduce resting ear temperature, but during any given point during heat exposure the ear temperature was about 0.5C lower after acclimation.\n\nSynthesizing these studies, the following seem to be true:\n\nNearly any form of heat stress, upon repetition, causes at least a 0.2C decline in resting core body temperature.\n\nNearly any form of heat stress, upon repetition, causes at least a 0.2C decline in resting core body temperature.\n\nMost studies use low temperatures in the range of 38-50C, which produces rather pathetic drops in core body temperature on the order of the 0.2C minimum.\n\nMost studies use low temperatures in the range of 38-50C, which produces rather pathetic drops in core body temperature on the order of the 0.2C minimum.\n\nThe longest study is eight weeks and it unfortunately does not show us the time course of adaptation across the study. However, the 0.2C drop in heated core body temperature seems consistent with the magnitude of effect found in shorter studies, so it suggests that the short-term effect becomes stable and carried forward indefinitely while the stimulus is maintained.\n\nThe longest study is eight weeks and it unfortunately does not show us the time course of adaptation across the study.

The drop gets larger with every successive day, showing that seven days in a row is insufficient to reach the final effect.\n\nThe second study shows a much less impressive and even inconsistent drop using 30 minutes at 100C three times a week. This suggests that either 30 minutes is not long enough, that breaking the 30 minutes into 10-minute sessions with 5-minute seriously detracts from the benefit, or that three times a week is not often enough to leverage the full drop in body temperature that can be achieved.\n\nThe second study shows a much less impressive and even inconsistent drop using 30 minutes at 100C three times a week.

However, the last study in the list maintained a target ear temperature of 38.5C for 100 minutes a day and generated zero drop in resting temperature. The first study kept the exposure constant, and the peak rectal temperature declined across the week from 38.5C to 38.0C. This indicates to me that the exposure should be controlled, not the body temperature reached, and that you want the sauna hot (80C) and humid (35-38%).\n\nOne difference between those two studies is that the first acutely raised rectal temperature to 38.5C, while the second only raised oral temperature to 37.6C.

However, the weak and inconsistent effect in the second study suggests that much of the acclimation may be lost within 2-3 days.\n\nIt is clear from the crossover study that four weeks is plenty of time to lose all of the acclimation.

If we define 30 minutes of 100 C three times a week at 20-30% humidity as clearly inadequate, we could say that the best range to experiment with is 30-60 minutes of 80-100C at 30-38% humidity between once every two days and twice a day.\n\nThe most powerful approach appears to be 1 hour of 80C twice a day at 35-38% humidity.

Thus, at rest skeletal muscle temperature lags behind core temperature by over 2C, and during whole-body heating the lag becomes smaller, about 0.7C.\n\nIn 11 highly trained distance runners, as their running reaches close to 100% VO2max over 30 minutes, rectal temperature rises to just under 40C.\n\nOne of the subjects in that study was Edward Winrow. His rectal temperature was 40.8C after winning the 1968 Olympic Marathon Trial.\n\nFour healthy male subjects between the ages of 21 and 32 exercised at three different intensities at three temperatures for 30-60 minutes. At 20C, after 27%, 46%, and 72% VO2max, respective rectal temperatures were 37.4, 38.0, and 38.6, while respective muscle temperatures were 38.1, 38.8, and 39.2. At 10C, rectal was 37.5, 38.0, and 38.6, while muscle was 37.9, 38.5, and 39.4. At 30C, rectal was 37.5, 38.1, and 38.8, while muscle was 38.3, 38.9, 39.9. This suggests that submaximal exercise always raises muscle temperature to 0.4-1.1C higher than core temperature, and that 72% VO2max is required to generate core temperatures similar to those achieved with sauna.\n\nIn 15 pregnant and 15 non-pregnant white Nordic female elite and recreational athletes, five five-minute treadmill intervals at about 90% of maximal heart rate interspersed by 4-minute rests raised rectal temperature to 38.4C. This suggests that high-intensity interval exercise approximates core body temperatures achieved with sauna.\n\nIn a randomized crossover trial in 12 male university Rugby players, high-intensity interval training involving 15 2-minute cycling sprints, absolute ear temperatures were not reported, but drinking an ice slurry at -2C produced a greater drop in ear temperature during rest periods than a room temperature drink, and it increased peak power. This shows that the rise in core body temperature that occurs during exercise limits performance.\n\n12 healthy, young, physically active males with a mean age of 22 swallowed a thermometer pill and did two evening bouts each of no exercise, aerobic exercise, or resistance exercise in crossover fashion (it is unclear if it was randomized). The aerobic exercise was 30 minutes at 75% of maximum heart rate. The resistance training was three sets of ten at 75% of 10-rep max for chest press, bicep curl, seated triceps press, side lateral shoulder raise, and rear leg elevated lunge.\n\nCore body temperature reached a sliver under 38.0 during the aerobic exercise, but only 37.5 during the resistance exercise.\n\nAs covered in Why I Don’t Care About Zone 2, when heart rate is 75% of max, percent of VO2max could be anywhere between 38% and 86%.\n\nThus, all exercise raises core body temperature, but neither resistance exercise at these intensities nor cardio under 90% of max heart rate and 75% of VO2 max can approximate the temperatures achieved with sauna.\n\nIn 24 adult women with chronic insomnia randomized to three sessions per week of aerobic exercise or control, rectal temperatures were nearly identical. At their highest point the exercise group was slightly higher (37.7C vs 37.6C) and at their lowest point the exercise group was slightly lower (36.3C vs 36.5C), neither of which were statistically significant.\n\nIn 24 endurance runners who had been running an average of 46 miles per week for 7-34 years, 24-hour average core body temperature measured by a swallowed thermometer pill was nearly identical (36.86C) to 24 healthy individuals consuming a western diet who were matched based on age, sex, and percent body fat (36.83C), but higher than a matched group practicing calorie restriction (36.64C).\n\nThus, unlike sauna, regular exercise does not seem to lower resting core body temperature.\n\nIt is clear that muscle temperature becomes a major driver of fatigue and one of the most important limitations of performance during exercise, so why doesn’t exercise seem to stimulate the same decrease in resting core temperature as sauna?\n\nI suspect this is explained as follows:\n\nDuring exercise, the core acts as a sink for heat generated by the muscle. While sweating is clearly used to dissipate heat out of the body, long-term adaptations could focus on moving heat out of the muscle into the rest of the body.\n\nDuring exercise, the core acts as a sink for heat generated by the muscle.

Further, exercise has reliable physiological triggers so the adaptations might be more specific to exercise, whereas sauna is imposed externally so the adaptations may be more generalized.\n\nThere are lots of other stimuli occurring during exercise and energy may be invested in many other adaptations.

The only way the body can fight heat being transferred inward is to reverse this at the point of its contact with the environment.\n\nDuring sauna, the entire body is becoming a sink for heat generated by the environment. The only way the body can fight heat being transferred inward is to reverse this at the point of its contact with the environment.\n\nSince the environment of a sauna is hot and humid, this imposes a very specific stress at the point of the body surface: it is harder for sweat to evaporate when the environment is humid, and it is harder to transfer heat from sweat to the environment when the environment is hot.\n\nSince the environment of a sauna is hot and humid, this imposes a very specific stress at the point of the body surface: it is harder for sweat to evaporate when the environment is humid, and it is harder to transfer heat from sweat to the environment when the environment is hot.\n\nThus, I believe the decrease in resting body temperature caused by sauna use is much more about the difficulty of disposing of heat at the body surface rather than about the transfer of heat within the body. The study showing the largest drop with 1 hour of 80 C at 35% humidity probably had such a large effect not because the core temperatures of the subjects were so high, but because both the heat and humidity made it hard for them to reject the heat into the environment. Thus, they rapidly adapted their ability to move heat from themselves to their environment by sweating more easily and transferring heat through sweat more easily, and when they were not in the sauna this led to a large drop in body temperature.\n\nIn Guatemalan sugar workers, blood levels of heat-shock proteins increase 48% by the end of the hot season. This is smaller than what can be achieved at the end of an acute bout of heated exercise, but it is actually double the rise that occurs after ten consecutive days of treadmill walking at 49C.\n\n20 healthy males between the ages of 20 and 25 underwent ten sessions of Finnish sauna conducted over three weeks with each session being three 15-minute bouts of 90C sauna interspersed with 2 minutes of cool-down using running water three times.\n\nThe heat shock protein response was strong after the first session, but it was incredibly weak after the tenth session, and the basal levels were never meaningfully increased.\n\nThis is probably because rectal temperatures declined from 37.04C to 36.68C, indicating that the adaptation to remove heat from the body effectively trumps the need for heat-shock proteins.\n\nThis is consistent with an experiment in rats suggesting heat-shock proteins are part of the short-term rather than long-term response to heat stress. When the rats are first exposed to 41 or 43C for 2 hours, their heat shock proteins spike 4-fold to 5-fold. After two days of acclimating to a constant temperature of 34C, their basal production of heat shock proteins nearly triples. However, after 30 days of acclimation to 34C, their basal heat shock protein production goes almost to zero. When re-challenged at 41 or 43C, the proteins increase only 2-fold. Thus, for rats, during the long-term acclimation to a higher ambient temperature, other adaptations come to predominate over heat-shock proteins.\n\nAmong those, unlike humans, rats seem to be good at cooling their core body temperatures during acclimation to constant heat. Rectal temperatures increased from 37.50 to 38.04 by day one, had already fallen to 37.86 by day 2, and had fallen to 37.80 by day 30. This indicates that heat-shock proteins are mainly a function of core body temperature, and rats are better than humans at cooling their core temperatures when exposed to constant higher ambient temperature.\n\nThus, Guatemalan sugarcane workers have elevated HSPs after the hot season because humans are horrible at lowering our core body temperatures in response to constant heat.\n\nHowever, humans are excellent are lowering our core body temperatures in response to sufficient sauna stimulus, and thus the heat-shock protein response is unneeded and practically abolished by the time the sauna stimulus has lowered our core body temperature.\n\nTherefore, high ambient heat is bad, regular sauna use with otherwise cool ambient temperature is good, and the ability to remove heat from the body is what is important, not increasing the expression of heat-shock proteins.\n\nIn 1971, George Brooks and colleagues published research done on rat skeletal muscle mitochondria showing that elevated temperature from 37C to 40C increases mitochondrial respiration as a result of ATP-utilizing enzymes becoming less efficient and “leaking” energy, while temperatures between 41 and 45C appear to impair the use of oxygen to generate ATP.\n\nIn a more recent study with human natural killer cells, temperatures up to 40C had no impact at all on ATP levels. Between 41 and 45C, they started dropping off a cliff, with the depletion being stronger the higher the temperature and the longer the duration.\n\nThe ATP-depleting effects found at 41C and above would not be expected to result from sauna use. For example, the main study the sauna hard and stay cool protocol is based on had core temperatures reach 38.5C in the first session and 38.0C in the seventh session.\n\nHuman studies suggest the main impact of heat is an acute shift away from fat metabolism and toward carbohydrate metabolism.\n\nTwelve endurance-trained males with a mean age of 22 did 40 minutes of cycling at 70% VO2 max in 20% humidity and either 20C or 40C heat in random order. Rectal temperature went from 37C to 38.6C with exercise alone, which is typical of a sauna. Exercising in heat brought rectal temperature to 39.6C, which exceeds that typically achieved by sauna. Muscle temperature reached 40.7C. These are all beneath the ATP-depleting range.\n\nExercise with and without heat had no effect on ATP, ADP, or their ratio; AMP was higher only after heated exercise; exercise and heat synergistically increased ammonia and the conversion of creatine phosphate to creatine; and exercise and heat synergistically and dramatically raised lactate and depleted glycogen levels.\n\nWhile fat oxidation wasn’t measured, this implies an impairment of fat oxidation drove energy toward carbohydrate oxidation (glycogen depletion and lactate accumulation), amino acid oxidation (ammonia accumulation) and depletion of creatine phosphate.\n\nThis paper cites several others using higher intensities, showing that ATP was substantially depleted, so this represents effect of moderate intensity in heat, and high intensities can deplete the ATP pool (which can occur in intense exercise even without heat).\n\nOther studies did measure carbohydrate and fat oxidation or infer their ratio.\n\nIn a randomized crossover study, 12 healthy males completed an incremental cycling test, once at 18.3C, the other at 36.3C. 21% less total fat was oxidized in the hotter environment despite no change in total energy expenditure. The total amount of carbohydrate oxidized was 26% greater but it just failed to reach statistical significance (P=0.07).\n\nSeven male college students completed a crossover study where they cycled at 66% of maximum heart rate for sixty minutes at either 22C or -10C. Total energy expenditure was 13% greater in the cold environment, fat oxidation was 35% higher, with the carbohydrate oxidation presumably reduced to explain the difference.\n\nA more recent study in ten healthy men with a mean age of 24 found that walking or running at 50 or 70% VO2max for sixty minutes at 0C instead of 22C caused the same shift toward fatty acid oxidation, but no difference in plasma catecholamines or free fatty acids, suggesting that the change is driven by effects on the muscle tissue itself rather than on centrally coordinated supply of substrates to the muscle via the circulation.\n\nAn experiment in rats suggests these are short-term changes. When rats are continuously exposed to 35C/95F, they deplete their glycogen acutely over 6 hours, but they recover it by 24 hours, and then they super-compensate with greater than baseline glycogen in an extended process that peaks on day 21.\n\nAs reviewed above, rats seem to adapt to constant ambient temperature rises by cooling their core temperatures, while humans do this in response to sauna but not in response to a constant ambient temperature increase.\n\nIf we use this knowledge to extrapolate from the rat study, we could infer that intermittent sauna use will acutely shift us toward carbohydrate oxidation but this will rebound after sufficient adaptation.\n\nTwo studies involving direct application of heat to muscle suggest that repeated heating leads to improvements in mitochondrial function over time.\n\nIn 20 sedentary but otherwise healthy men and women with a mean age of 21, a leg of each volunteer was randomized to serve as a control leg or to be heated with short-wave diathermy, which uses radio waves to generate heat. Heating was carried out for two hours a day for six consecutive days. Heating raised the muscle temperature by 3.9C from just under 36C to just under 40C. AMPK was acutely activated by the end of the first session. At 24 hours after the last heating session, HSP70 increased 45% and HSP90 increased 38%, and the pro-mitochondrial gene expression influencer PGC1-alpha was elevated. Complex I was increased by 37% and ATP synthase was increased by 39%, while other respiratory chain complexes were unaffected. Complex I-mediated respiration, maximal uncoupled respiration (ability to use energy to generate heat rather than ATP), and total oxidative phosphorylation were all increased 28-29%.\n\nIn 24 men and women aged 18-39, the left leg was immobilized and subjects were randomized to a diathermy or placebo treatment for two hours a day for ten consecutive days. The heat treatment raised muscle temperature from just under 36C to 40C. Immobilization had no effect on HSP70, but decreased HSP90 and PGC1-alpha. Heat increased all three of these proteins. Immobilization hurt many aspects of mitochondrial function, and heat abolished the loss of mitochondrial function caused by immobilization.\n\nThe mechanisms underlying all of this are unclear, but I would suggest the following:\n\nIf cytosolic ATP utilization becomes “leaky” the way the Brooks paper showed for mitochondrial ATP utilization, the ATP utilization in the cytosol could increase local demand for ATP recycling, putting pressure on greater glycolysis and the creatine phosphate pool to keep the cytosolic ATP pool maintained.\n\nIf cytosolic ATP utilization becomes “leaky” the way the Brooks paper showed for mitochondrial ATP utilization, the ATP utilization in the cytosol could increase local demand for ATP recycling, putting pressure on greater glycolysis and the creatine phosphate pool to keep the cytosolic ATP pool maintained.\n\nTo the extent the recycling is biased toward the ATP demand of contracting muscle, it could come at the expense of the ATP-dependent joining of fatty acids to CoA, which is needed to enable their transport into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.\n\nTo the extent the recycling is biased toward the ATP demand of contracting muscle, it could come at the expense of the ATP-dependent joining of fatty acids to CoA, which is needed to enable their transport into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.\n\nAlternatively, or perhaps complementarily, it may be that the stability of the mitochondrial membrane is central to the carnitine shuttle. For a given temperature, this is maintained by adjusting the polyunsaturated fatty acid content (which increases fluidity) and the cholesterol content (which increases stability). Heat adds fluidity and cold adds stability. Heat therefore could hurt fatty acid oxidation by decreasing the stability of the membrane while cold could do the opposite, and this could make the cell focus on the pool of glycogen and creatine phosphate, and the collection of amino acids that can be oxidized in the cytosol, thereby completely avoiding any dependence on intracellular membrane composition. Long-term adaptation can allow cell membranes to adjust their PUFA and cholesterol content to match the fluidity needs of the repeated stress.\n\nAlternatively, or perhaps complementarily, it may be that the stability of the mitochondrial membrane is central to the carnitine shuttle.

Long-term adaptation can allow cell membranes to adjust their PUFA and cholesterol content to match the fluidity needs of the repeated stress.\n\nDifficulty meeting the demands for ATP and the massive increase in NADH that accompanies increased glycolysis drive the increases in mitochondrial complex I and ATP synthase.\n\nDifficulty meeting the demands for ATP and the massive increase in NADH that accompanies increased glycolysis drive the increases in mitochondrial complex I and ATP synthase.\n\nRegardless of the mechanisms involved, the evidence favors that the ATP pool is not hurt by repeated sauna use, that respiratory chain function probably benefits from the hormetic stress of heat, and that fuel use is acutely biased by heat toward carbohydrate, which has a good chance of being completely counter-balanced by fat oxidation over the course of long-term adaptation.\n\nThus, the lower body heat that occurs with the sauna hard and stay cool protocol is driven not by decreased energy metabolism, but rather by improved removal of heat from the body.\n\nSince muscle heat clearly limits athletic performance, one could surmise that improved removal of heat from the body is actually very helpful to energy metabolism.\n\nIn any case, the stay cool part itself should increase the metabolic rate about 6% if food intake is held constant.\n\nTesticles are located outside of the body because normal body temperature is too hot for sperm.\n\nIf normal body temperature is too hot for sperm, then you would think sauna would be way too hot for sperm.\n\nIn ten healthy men with normal sperm and a mean age of 33, Finnish sauna at 80-90C and 20 to 30% humidity for 15 minutes two days a week for three months took a huge wack at sperm count and took a small bite out of progressive motility without impacting morphology of viability:\n\nThese values took six months of no sauna to go back to baseline.\n\nA similar study using sauna for only two weeks found that sperm bounced back after only one week.\n\nThis can probably be totally avoided by keeping your testicles in an ice pack, though there is no evidence showing its efficacy. But, come on — this is why testicles are outside of the body in the first place. Just do it.\n\nSubtitle: A Self-Experiment for Methylation Health (and Battling Gray Hair)\n\nDescription: A Self-Experiment for Methylation Health (and Battling Gray Hair)",

Some are common, others are rare and extreme. No one will have all of them.\n\nAnimal experiments show glycine extends lifespan, so if you are healthy and simply looking to optimize for longevity, this alone should be a reason to optimize your glycine status.\n\nGlycine supplementation is very safe according to existing studies. However, many people anecdotally report adverse effects from glycine supplements such as insomnia, overstimulation, or headaches.\n\nEven if you do not notice any adverse effect from a glycine supplement, it could be generating oxalate, which is a mitochondrial toxin and probably nullifies the benefits of glycine toward lifespan. Oxalate could crystallize in the kidney, joints, or brain, contributing to long-term loss of function in those organs over time.\n\nHypothetically, excess glycine could also generate methylglyoxal, which could aggravate oxidative stress, accelerate aging, and cause diabetes.\n\nMost glycine is synthesized from carbohydrate using an input of nitrogen from the amino acid glutamate and an assortment of vitamin and mineral cofactors. Thus, it is important to consume enough protein and carbohydrate to maintain endogenous glycine synthesis, and it is probably much safer to default to promoting robust endogenous synthesis than to jump straight into taking glycine supplements.\n\nThe ability to tolerate glycine supplements depends on robust nutritional support for two primary ways to convert glycine to carbon dioxide instead of oxalate, ensuring also that excessive glycine does not accumulate, which could lead to an awkward mix of excess neurological excitation and inhibition and general neurotoxicity.\n\nThe Glycine Protocol is my 7-Page quick guide to optimizing glycine status that guides you step-by-step through all the reasons your glycine levels or glycine tolerance could need improvement.\n\nGet the Glycine Protocol here:\n\nClick Here to Get the Glycine Protocol\n\nThis article is reserved for Masterpass members.

    "content": "3 grams of glycine one hour before bed has been shown to reduce daytime sleepiness, help people fall asleep faster, and help people feel more rested and perform better cognitively during the day, and 15 grams of collagen peptides (which are rich in glycine) taken one hour before bed has been shown to help people stay asleep without waking up in the middle of the night.\n\n5 grams of glycine cuts the blood sugar response in half when it is taken alongside 25 grams of glucose.\n\nGlycine-rich collagen promotes collagen synthesis, and 1000 Calories of collagen for four weeks has been shown to help severe burn victims heal nearly four times faster.\n\nGlycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, which is why it helps sleep, and disorders of glycine synthesis or signaling cause increased muscle tension, excessive startle response, and joint dislocations. The joint dislocations are probably a result of the muscles being too stiff to keep joints in correct alignment, so we might suppose that general muscular stiffness and poor joint alignment is in part driven by suboptimal glycine status in most of us who have such problems.\n\nDespite its role as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, glycine is also needed to enable excitatory NMDA-type glutamate receptors to be activated by glutamate. Thus, deficiencies in glycine could impair neuronal excitation, which could hurt alertness, learning, and executive function. Poor function of NMDA receptors has been implicated in schizophrenia. 11 trials using between 30 and 60 grams per day of glycine for six to 28 weeks suggest glycine could cut schizophrenia symptoms on the order of 20-35%. The most common side effects of high-dose glycine in these trials were nausea and dry mouth.\n\nGlycine may even help you live longer, as it does in mice.\n\nAll of this makes glycine look GREAT.\n\nThe problem is that excesses of glycine can be removed in one of two ways:\n\nOne is to break glycine down to CO2 and ammonia in the glycine cleavage system, which is a mitochondrial multi-enzyme system dependent on magnesium, lipoic acid, vitamin B6 as pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP or P5P), folate in the form of tetrahydrofolate (THF), riboflavin in the form of FAD, and niacin in the form of NAD+. The energy in the chemical bonds is carried away to the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the form of NADH.\n\nOne is to break glycine down to CO2 and ammonia in the glycine cleavage system, which is a mitochondrial multi-enzyme system dependent on magnesium, lipoic acid, vitamin B6 as pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP or P5P), folate in the form of tetrahydrofolate (THF), riboflavin in the form of FAD, and niacin in the form of NAD+. The energy in the chemical bonds is carried away to the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the form of NADH.\n\nThe second is to break glycine down via D-amino acid oxidase in peroxisomes to glyoxalate. Peroxisomes assist mitochondria with energy metabolism and serve specialized lipid synthesis and broad detoxification roles. D-amino acid oxidase uses molecular oxygen and riboflavin in the form of FAD, and when it converts glycine to glyoxalate it releases ammonia and hydrogen peroxide as byproducts. Glyoxalate can then be converted by L-lactate dehydrogenase using NAD+ to oxalate. However, formation of oxalate can be avoided if alanine-glyoxalate aminotransferase (AGT, encoded by the AGXT gene, which is defective in the genetic disorder primary hyperoxaluria type 1) converts the glyoxalate back to glycine, which requires vitamin B6 and the simultaneous conversion of the amino acid alanine to pyruvate.\n\nThe second is to break glycine down via D-amino acid oxidase in peroxisomes to glyoxalate.

This could be an alternative way of clearing excess glycine that is largely similar to burning glucose for energy.\n\nAll excesses of glycine are likely to contribute to some type of harm: carbon for carbon, calorie for calorie, glycine generates more NADH through the glycine cleavage system than any other molecule that can be burned for energy, which can stress complex I of the respiratory chain and impair NAD+-dependent reactions throughout the cell; when excess glycine generates oxalate, it is generating a molecule that not only forms crystals in the kidneys, joints, and brain, but also poisons energy metabolism by inhibiting glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the citric acid cycle, and the clearance of the potentially neurotoxic D-lactate.\n\nJust because a biochemical pathway shows something can happen doesn’t mean that it does and doesn’t tell us how quantitatively important it is. So, let’s look at the evidence that glycine is converted to oxalate in humans.\n\nBut first, the short answer.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. Any products linked herein may be affiliate links. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nMeasure your glucose and lactate upon waking after an overnight fast and/or one-hour postprandially on a day-to-day basis after a relatively standardized test meal. Test how this changes in response to different regimes of glycine supplementation. If glucose and lactate rise, glycine is likely overriding your respiratory chain; if glucose rises and lactate falls, glycine is likely being converted to oxalate. Run the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening and focus on fixing deficiencies of thiamin, B6, total folate, tetrahydrofolate, magnesium, potassium, lipoic acid, riboflavin, or niacin; or, cut back on the dose of glycine until glucose and lactate normalize.\n\nIsotopic labeling is a technique to allow the tracing of an administered molecule through a biochemical pathway. The technique involves altering the weight of an atom within a molecule so that atomic weight signature can be monitored in the end products one is looking for. So, to test whether glycine is converted to oxalate, scientists have modified the weight of one or another carbon on the glycine molecule to look for the modified atoms showing up in urinary oxalate.\n\nEarly studies from the 1950s and 60s (here, here, and here) indicated that when just under 200 milligrams of isotopically labeled glycine were administered orally every six hours over the course of two to four days to human subjects consuming low-oxalate diets, between 20-50% of urinary oxalate could be accounted for by the glycine.\n\nIn subjects with primary hyperoxaluria, a set of genetic disorders that increase endogenous oxalate generation, the proportion of glycine that became oxalate was several times higher than in healthy subjects, but this was reflected in proportionally higher urinary oxalate, so the percentage of urinary oxalate accounted for by the glycine was not actually different.\n\nA 2010 paper infused about 32 milligrams of labeled glycine per hour for five hours and found no label in urinary oxalate. When they infused ten times this amount, plasma glycine increased 29%, whole-body glycine flux increased 72%, and glycine accounted for 16% of urinary oxalate.\n\nThis was on a background diet containing 50 milligrams of oxalate and 1000 milligrams of calcium.\n\nThe authors of this paper argued that the older studies grossly overestimated the contribution of glycine due to outdated methodology for isotopic labeling and for urinary oxalate detection, and that their use of oral glycine instead of infused glycine complicated their analysis. However, one could also argue this study was too short, since the older studies found that the glycine label took a day or two to maximize its abundance in the urinary oxalate, and one could further argue that oral glycine is far more relevant to nearly any real-world use of this amino acid.\n\nMore importantly, however, the larger amount of glycine that accounted for 16% of urinary oxalate was only about 1.6 grams of glycine.\n\nThis indicates that supplemental doses of glycine between 3 grams and 60 grams are likely to generate plenty of oxalate.\n\nFurther, the oxalate values in the urine suggest a dose-response with the glycine infusion: the low dose was associated with a urinary oxalate of 0.89 milligrams per urine spot collection instead of 0.82, and the high dose was associated with a urinary oxalate of 1.02 instead of 0.8. These differences were not statistically significant, but the yield of oxalate from glycine at the higher dose was demonstrated robustly with isotopic labeling, making it clear that glycine was in fact converted to oxalate. If we average the baseline of 0.8 and 0.82 to yield 0.81, oxalate was 10% higher with the lower dose and 26% higher with the higher dose. These overall are consistent in magnitude with the labeling estimate that ~1.6 grams of glycine accounted for 16% of urinary oxalate.\n\nThese studies had between one and seven people each, and none of them demonstrated a statistically significant rise in total oxalate.\n\nThey provide proof of principle that glycine is on average partially converted to oxalate and that it can be a major source of urinary oxalate, but they do not make it clear how much glycine generates oxalate under what circumstances and whether supplementing with glycine will increase the total oxalate burden.\n\nHowever, the balance of the existing evidence does favor glycine as a cause of increased oxalate.\n\nI do not know of any randomized controlled trials of glycine supplementation that looked for changes in total urinary oxalate as an outcome.\n\nThe following methods have not been vetted in randomized controlled trials, and are instead derived from biochemical reasoning.\n\nIf NADH accumulates beyond the capacity for it to be cleared by the mitochondrial respiratory chain, it will inhibit glycolysis and favor the accumulation of lactate at the expense of pyruvate. The primary signature of this will be an increase in lactate with a likely rise in glucose alongside it.\n\nOxalate inhibits glycolysis at the step of pyruvate kinase, which inhibits pyruvate production and therefore inhibits lactate production. The primary signature of this will be an increase in the ratio of glucose to lactate. If glucose goes up and lactate goes down this would be a strong signature of this occurring.\n\nWhile you could test 24-hour urine oxalate on a certain long-term dose of glycine, measuring fasting levels of glucose and lactate at home, and/or measuring one-hour postprandial levels from day to day after a relatively controlled test meal, can give more real-time feedback and can allow you to do more tests on different doses and make decisions much more quickly.\n\nThe equipment I use for this: ​KetoMojo meter and strips​, Novabiomedical Lactate Plus ​meter​, Novabiomedical Lactate Plus ​strips​, ​alcohol pads​; If you plan to do a LOT of testing, ​extra KetoMojo strips​, extra ​lactate strips​, and ​extra 30g lancets.\n\nGlycine has been shown to lower postprandial glucose responses, if glycine raises glucose this is a strong signal the dose is going beyond your tolerance.\n\nIf you are not getting an empirical benefit to the dose of glycine you are using, the most sensible thing is to cut back on the dose.\n\nHowever, if you want to increase your tolerance, you need to run the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening and use the Cheat Sheet for interpreting the results, looking for deficiencies in the following:\n\nDeficiencies of B6, folate, magnesium, and potassium could prevent clean conversion of glycine to glucose or energy without overloading the respiratory chain.\n\nDeficiencies of B6, folate, magnesium, and potassium could prevent clean conversion of glycine to glucose or energy without overloading the respiratory chain.\n\nAdditional deficiencies of tetrahydrofolate, lipoic acid, riboflavin, or niacin could be hurting the glycine cleavage system and encouraging use of D-amino acid oxidase in its place.\n\nAdditional deficiencies of tetrahydrofolate, lipoic acid, riboflavin, or niacin could be hurting the glycine cleavage system and encouraging use of D-amino acid oxidase in its place.\n\nNotably, the need for tetrahydrofolate could explain the need for supplemental glycine in the first place, since it is the form of folate needed to synthesize glycine from glucose. This was covered in Why You Need to Start Juicing Tonight and Why Your Folate Supplement May Be Working Against You.\n\nThiamin deficiency raises oxalate in animals, and this is probably because it prevents pyruvate clearance, which would be expected to backup the AGXT reaction and to prevent the clean clearance of serine. Thus, thiamin deficiency should also be fixed if found.\n\nDue to the complexity of biochemistry, increased oxalate could be a second- or third-order effect of many other deficiencies, which is why it is always with zero exceptions best to be comprehensive about nutritional screening and fix any problems that are found.\n\nWhat is your experience with glycine?

    "content": "If you have trouble sleeping, problems with anxiety, or get startled easily, I’ve got a quick solution for you, and it involves some green juice.\n\nThere’s about a fifty percent chance your problem is that your glycine levels are low.\n\nSupplementing with glycine could certainly help. After all, glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts primarily in the brainstem where it helps lower your startle reflex, relax your muscles, calm your mood, and cool your body in preparation for deep sleep.\n\nHowever, glycine supplementation can increase the production of the mitochondrial toxin oxalate. Oxalate can form crystals in the kidneys where it causes kidney stones, or in the brain, where it causes cognitive problems. It impairs glycolysis, which could contribute to diabetes, and it impairs gluconeogenesis, which could lower blood sugar. It impairs the citric acid cycle, which could cause fatigue and could impair myelin synthesis, leading to long-term neurological problems. Oxalate also powerfully inhibits D-lactate dehydrogenase, which is responsible for clearing away D-lactate. If D-lactate isn’t cleared, it poisons the brain, at extreme levels causing confusion, disorientation, slurred speech, difficulty coordinating movements, walking awkwardly, headache, hunger, irritability, aggression, hallucinations, and paranoia.\n\nGlycine supplementation itself, in excess, can overload complex I of the respiratory chain, which can back up metabolism at a much more general level, worsening most metabolic problems.\n\nNone of this is to say glycine supplementation is bad. In fact, I supplement with glycine myself.\n\nHowever, most glycine is synthesized from glucose with the help of several vitamins and minerals.\n\nIt is far better to enable your own glycine synthesis as a foundation for your calmness and great sleep than to supplement with megadoses of it.\n\nAlways start by giving your body what it needs, not what you want it to have.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nA major reason for poor glycine synthesis can be lack of a specific form of folate called tetrahydrofolate (THF).\n\nThe supplement industry has seriously under-thought the provision of folate supplements, as a THF supplement is critically necessary to round out what can be gotten from food. In fact, if you take methylfolate or folinic acid, it is possible you could worsen the problem. The industry unfortunately has given up on offering THF supplements because THF is unstable in free form.\n\nTHF can quickly oxidize to dihydrofolate (DHF) and then break down spontaneously to pterin and p-aminobenzoate, compounds with no nutritional utility to humans. In free form, THF disappears within an hour.\n\nHowever, THF is strongly stabilized by folate-binding protein, which is present on the surface of most mammalian cells and is involved in shuttling folate into the mammary gland, where it is released into milk. It also increases its absorption in the intestinal tract. Folate-binding protein is destroyed by pasteurization. Raw milk is an incredibly important source of folate for an infant or a small child, but the amount of folate — about 12 micrograms per serving — is too small to be of use for an adult trying to combat anxiety, elevated startle reflex, and sleep disruption due to poor glycine synthesis.\n\nFolate is named after the Greek word for “leaf” due its abundance in leafy vegetables, though I like to think of the “three L’s” as sources of folate: liver, legumes, and leafy greens. In reality it does not matter if they are leafy, it just matters that they are green. For example, broccoli crowns are great sources of folate.\n\nIn most vegetables, folate is largely found as methylfolate, which is far more stable than THF and is in fact the most stable form of folate. Despite this, cooking vegetables causes loss of 25-70% of the folate. Greater losses are incurred when folate can be lost in cooking water, and if you chop or shred veggies before rinsing, folate will be lost in the rinsing water in proportion to the surface area you created. Further, vegetable folate degrades during frozen storage: after 3-9 months, 75-95% of the folate is lost. Dried legumes seem to be stable when stored properly, but cooking them causes loss of about half the folate, which is evenly distributed between destruction and loss in the cooking water.\n\nIn liver, cooking has no effect on total folate, but some of the methylfolate turns to THF, causing the proportion of total folate as THF to increase from 26% to 37%. If the liver is frozen, 80% of its THF is retained after six months.\n\nThis indicates that THF is stable in raw milk and liver, but even methylfolate is unstable in vegetables during cooking and freezing.\n\nHowever, raw milk has too little folate, and while the amount in liver is substantial, you would overdose on vitamin A and copper if you tried to meet your folate requirement from liver alone.\n\nThe industry could step up and either make a folate-binding-protein-bound THF, or figure out what makes THF so stable in liver and add those components to the THF supplement.\n\nInstead, we will breeze past the industry at lightning speed and come up with our own solution: drink your lettuce.\n\nAs can be seen in the table below, methylfolate and other folate forms convert to THF during juicing, and the THF can be found in both the juice and the pulp. The highest amounts of THF are found in juiced beet greens, turnip greens, broccoli, and romaine lettuce.\n\nBeet greens are loaded with oxalate. Turnip greens have a modest amount of oxalate. Broccoli is incredibly nutritious, but when you start juicing it you really get the opportunity to overload your system with thiocyanate-generating compounds that inhibit the uptake of iodine into the thyroid and mammary glands. By contrast, romaine lettuce has no oxalate and no cyanide-related toxins.\n\nSome lettuces exude a milky white substance rich in lactucarium or related compounds, which can have sedative and analgesic effects and are toxic in very large quantities. However, this generally correlates to bitter taste, and romaine lettuce is very mild rather than bitter, a sign that it should be tolerated well in quite high quantities.\n\nIf you diversify your vegetables, you will protect yourself from overloading on any one particular bad component; however, juiced romaine lettuce appears to be the best all-around way to load up on THF to improve glycine synthesis.\n\nI personally found that creatine massively helped my sleep, yet it also increased by startle reflex in a manner that responded to glycine, and keeping my glycine levels up was needed to stabilize the sleep benefit. Blending 300 grams per day of romaine lettuce in a Vitamix, which seems to be like juicing except it includes the pulp, minimized the amount of glycine I needed to take.\n\nIf you aren’t using creatine, you need to read this article:\n\nYour Cells Are Starving for Creatine\n\nIf you get any side effects from using creatine, that’s actually a sign you need it.

    "title": "Hair Graying? Relax in the COLD 🥶",
    "content": "My mom got her first gray hair when she was 14, and I got my first gray hair when I was in my mid 20s.\n\nI long suspected that she was homozygous and I was heterozygous for an impairment in copper handling, since copper is the cofactor of the tyrosinase enzyme that initiates the conversion of the amino acid tyrosine to the primary body pigment melanin.\n\nHowever, I never felt like varying my copper status had any impact on my hair graying, and it was obvious that most increases in hair graying took place during high-stress periods that were punctuated by stability in hair color.\n\nFor example, I got my first gray hair during grad school, which was a high-stress period.\n\nIt turns out that my mom is homozygous for the A allele of the rs1126809 R402Q allele of tyrosinase (TYR), and I am heterozygous for it.\n\nFunctional studies (here, here, and here) indicate that this allele produces an enzyme that has totally normal activity at 31 C (87.8 F), but at 37 C (98.6 F) it loses 75% of its copper-binding activity and at least 75% if not all of its enzymatic activity.\n\nThis indicates that the allele confers thermolability on the enzyme, making it intolerant to heat to the extent that normal body temperature impairs it. This is a common theme in enzymatic impairments.\n\n31C is cold enough for hypothermia, and maintaining body temperature at that point is not a viable strategy to prevent hair graying.\n\nIndeed, high body temperature helps all enzymatic reactions occur more effectively if the enzymes do not have impairments that make them thermolabile. For example, the wild-type allele for tyrosinase operates more effectively at 43 C (109.4 F) than at body temperature, but this is above the threshold of fever (41-42 C, 105.9-10.7.6F) that can cause brain damage and become life-threatening.\n\nMaintaining supraphysiological copper concentrations is also not a viable strategy for preventing hair graying because high concentrations of free copper are toxic. In fact, they cause oxidative stress, which can lead to hydrogen peroxide production, which can destroy hair pigment and cause graying.\n\nThis allele is part of a grouping that is dose-dependently associated with lighter pigmentation of the hair, skin, and eyes.\n\nWhether it can contribute to albinism is controversial, but it appears that it cannot cause albinism on its own but it can contribute to it when combined with rare mutations.\n\nThis SNP is very common in people with European ancestry, where just under 40% of people are heterozygous and 7.6% are homozygous. It is not found in many Asians. It is found in American Blacks and Latin Americans, but not in African pygmies or Australian Aborigines, leading to speculation that it arose in Caucasians and spread to other groups through admixture.\n\nWhile toxic levels of copper and deliberate hypothermia are not viable strategies to optimize around the polymorphism, it does make sense to not worsen it by avoiding copper deficiency (manage copper status using the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening and the Cheat Sheet).\n\nIn the case of heterozygosity the temperature implications are difficult to predict, but if you are homozygous for this it may help to err on the side of maintaining cooler ambient temperatures.\n\nThe properties of the R402Q enzyme have only been measured at 31 and 37 C and not in between. However, most likely the loss of function begins to occur at some threshold temperature higher than 31 and then progresses linearly as the temperature increases toward body temperature, and gets worse at temperatures above that, which would occur transiently during fever, sauna, and exercise.\n\nIn theory we are warm blooded animals and regulate our body temperature tightly. However, the ability to compensate for ambient temperatures differs based on genetics and nutritional status, and is likely never complete. For example, Japanese, whose genetics were shaped in temperate environments, develop about double the elevation in body temperature during heat stress as Malaysians, whose genetics were shaped in tropical environments. When comparing 60 hours spent at 16C/60.8F to the same time spent at 22C/71.6F, core temperature is about a half degree lower.\n\nNone of this is to say you want a lower metabolic rate. In a colder ambient temperature, you increase your food intake and metabolic rate to stay warm as an adaptation.\n\nIt seems, moreover, that the R402Q polymorphism began as a mutation in the colder environments of northern Europe, so this all might be to say that your hair may gray a little faster if you are genetically adapted for the cold but spend way too much of your time in the heat.\n\nThat said, we know what stress does to hair color:\n\nThis principle is probably more universal, more actionable, and not dependent on genetics.\n\nIt was known in the early 20th century that Addison’s disease, which causes adrenal insufficiency, causes excessive skin pigmentation, and that adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a pituitary hormone that elicits the production of hormones by the adrenals, does the same. These two findings made sense together, because the adrenal insufficiency of Addison’s disease elicits a compensatory increase in pituitary secretion of ACTH. However, why ACTH would increase skin pigmentation remained a mystery through the 1950s because everything known about the production of melanin indicated that the copper-dependent enzyme tyrosinase made melanin from the amino acid tyrosine after ultraviolet light decreased the concentrations of antioxidant inhibitors of the enzyme like vitamin C and glutathione in the skin. Researchers tried to show that ACTH modified the status of copper, vitamin C, or glutathione but results were extremely conflicting and no consensus could be reached.\n\nFast forward to the 21st century and there is now a rich body of evidence showing ACTH regulation of melanin synthesis. ACTH and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) are both derived from processing of the precursor protein proopiomelanocortin (POMC). They both act primarily on the melanocortin-1 (MC1) receptor to increase skin pigmentation, and UV light sensitizes skin cells to their effects by increasing the density of receptors and also increases their production. The action of ACTH and MSH on these receptors activates melanin synthesis in cellular compartments known as melanosomes. A second melanocortin receptor known as the MC2 receptor also responds to ACTH. It is primarily expressed in the adrenals and is thought to be much more important in regulating adrenal hormone production, but it is also present in human skin cells and plays a subsidiary role in ACTH stimulation of melanin production.\n\nACTH most strongly elicits the production of cortisol by the adrenals, but it also elicits adrenal production of testosterone and aldosterone. It has a likely indirect ability to stimulate the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, but it has little effect on total circulating concentrations of norepinephrine because most norepinephrine is made in the nervous system. The primary determinants of ACTH levels are the diurnal rhythm that bottoms at night and peaks in the morning, and anything that would elicit a rise in cortisol, such as psychological or emotional stress or low blood sugar.\n\nCortisol, however, will exert negative feedback control on POMC.\n\nSo, if your stress response results in your cortisol being elevated beyond what is good for the body, the negative feedback on POMC will suppress the ACTH and MSH involved in pigmentation.\n\nMSH, which also suppresses food intake and stimulates sexual arousal, is one of many brain peptides that require vitamin C, copper, zinc, and glycine for their activation, so using the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening and the Cheat Sheet to optimize these nutrients could also be helpful.\n\nThe clearest thing, though, is you want to manage stress properly.\n\nAnd if you are homozygous for the R402Q (rs1126809 A/A) of the tyrosinase (TYR) gene, you may want to err on the side of staying cool.\n\nSubtitle: At least, if you have the R402Q tyrosinase polymorphism.\n\nDescription: At least, if you have the R402Q tyrosinase polymorphism.",

    "title": "The Science Behind the Crohn's Protocol",
    "content": "This is the science behind the Crohn’s Protocol.\n\nCrohn’s disease is one of two disorders grouped together as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the other being ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis exclusively impacts the colon, whereas Crohn’s can impact any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, though the ileum and proximal colon (that is, the last section of the small intestine and first section of the large intestine) are the most often affected. In ulcerative colitis, inflammation is limited to the mucosa, the mucus-rich superficial layer of the inside of the gut. In Crohn’s, by contrast, the inflammation is considered “transmural,” meaning that it can be found in every layer of the gut tissue, but it is also characterized by “skip areas” where diseased sections of the gut are interspersed by normal healthy sections.\n\nThe transmural nature of Crohn’s leads to laying down of scar tissue and the consequent narrowing of sections of the gut, known as strictures, which do not usually occur in ulcerative colitis. Recent research suggests that strictures are driven in part by adipose tissue surrounding the diseased intestinal tissue, possibly as a means of preventing bacterial translocation that could lead to abscesses or sepsis, which causes the space inside the intestine, known as the lumen, to become narrowed. This process is called “creeping fat.”\n\nThis diagram summarizes some of the basic abnormalities found in the gut tissue in association with Crohn’s:\n\nThe microbiome is altered in a negative fashion associated with low microbial diversity, low butyrate production, and low presence of its receptor GRP 43; bacteria become abundant that adhere to and/or degrade the protective layer of mucus, form biofilms, and move through the intestinal cells to the deep layers of the gut; there is loss of tight junctions (TJ) that form the gut barrier and consequent increases in intestinal permeability; there are decreased antimicrobial peptides known as defensins; and there are decreased regulatory T cells (Tregs) that keep inflammation in check and a proliferation of Th17 cells, a form of helper T cell associated with autoimmune conditions.\n\nThe causation of IBD is usually stated as involving an interaction between genetic susceptibility, the microbiome, and the immune system. It is probably better stated as an interaction between genetic susceptibility and diet with a completely unappreciated but very likely involvement of joint misalignments putting pressure on the gut, where the interaction between the microbiome and the immune system play intermediate roles in translating these factors into the manifestation of the disease.\n\nOverview: Epidemiology of Crohn’s, Pharmacological Treatment, Surgical Treatment\n\nOverview: Epidemiology of Crohn’s, Pharmacological Treatment, Surgical Treatment\n\nThe Role of the Gut Microbiota\n\nThe Role of the Gut Microbiota\n\nDietary Management of Crohn’s\n\nDietary Management of Crohn’s\n\nThe Role of Unabsorbed Iron in Hurting the Microbiome\n\nThe Role of Unabsorbed Iron in Hurting the Microbiome\n\nGenetic Risk Factors for Crohn’s\n\nGenetic Risk Factors for Crohn’s\n\nThe Contribution of Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nThe Contribution of Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nWhat Is the Ultimate Cause of Crohn’s?\n\nWhat Is the Ultimate Cause of Crohn’s?\n\nHow to Heal From Crohn’s Disease is my four-page quick guide that serves as a complete strategy to induce and maintain remission from Crohn's disease using diet and supplements.\n\nGet the Crohn’s Protocol here:\n\nClick Here to Get the Crohn's Protocol\n\nSubtitle: Anyone who has Crohn's or has a first-degree relative with Crohn's needs to understand the science of Crohn's and the extraordinary power of nutrition.\n\nDescription: Anyone who has Crohn's or has a first-degree relative with Crohn's needs to understand the science of Crohn's and the extraordinary power of nutrition.",

You can get the Sulfur Protocol here:\n\nClick Here to Get the Sulfur Protocol\n\nIf you want the science, keep reading.\n\nThe three sulfur compounds we care most about are hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfite, and S-sulfocysteine.\n\nH2S is an essential “gasotransmitter” that contributes to vasodilation, which can lower blood pressure and cause erections but also cause headaches. It is central to the hypoxia response, which prevents anemia and raises sex hormone production, but also drives cancer into a more aggressive phenotype and causes abnormal blood vessel growths. It promotes fat storage, which for a given caloric balance prevents diabetes but can make it hard to lose weight. At high concentrations, H2S becomes unambiguously harmful: it displaces oxygen on hemoglobin, and it displaces oxygen in complex IV of the respiratory chain. This constitutes poisoning, and, at its extreme, it can be lethal.\n\nSulfite is formed from H2S on the way to producing either sulfate or S-sulfocysteine. Sulfite appears to have no necessary role except by way of being an intermediate. It depletes B vitamins. It acts as a triple mitochondrial toxin by inhibiting two enzymes in mitochondrial energy metabolism and making mitochondria lose control over what substances take in. It depletes NADPH, which causes oxidative stress, messes with neurotransmitters, destroys sex hormone synthesis and is generally catabolic.\n\nS-sulfocysteine is likely a normal excitatory neurotransmitter, acting as a sidekick to glutamate the way glycine and another sulfur compound, taurine, act as a sidekick to the main inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. However, this also means it can contribute to anxiety, chronic pain, sensory overstimulation, muscle tension, sleep disruption, heart palpitations, and neurodegeneration.\n\nExploring the evidence for the different effects of these compounds requires an understanding of the different enzymes involved in their metabolism. We therefore consider the biochemical pathways first, and address the effects of dysregulation in “Exploring the Effects of Sulfur Metabolism Dysregulation” toward the end.\n\nHow These Sulfur Compounds Are Produced\n\nEndogenous Sulfur Catabolism\n\nRegulation and Cofactors for Endogenous Synthesis and Clearance\n\nThe Main Strategies for Shutting Down Sulfur Catabolism\n\nNutritional Strategies for Enabling Safe Sulfur Catabolism\n\nH2S Production in the Gut\n\nWhy This One Specific Fruit May Help\n\nSulfur Amino Acid Restriction: A Last Resort\n\nSulfur-Rich Vegetables and Sulfur-Inclusive Supplements\n\nHow These Sulfur Compounds Are Produced\n\nEndogenous Sulfur Catabolism\n\nRegulation and Cofactors for Endogenous Synthesis and Clearance\n\nThe Main Strategies for Shutting Down Sulfur Catabolism\n\nNutritional Strategies for Enabling Safe Sulfur Catabolism\n\nEndogenous Sulfur Catabolism\n\nRegulation and Cofactors for Endogenous Synthesis and Clearance\n\nRegulation and Cofactors for Endogenous Synthesis and Clearance\n\nThe Main Strategies for Shutting Down Sulfur Catabolism\n\nThe Main Strategies for Shutting Down Sulfur Catabolism\n\nNutritional Strategies for Enabling Safe Sulfur Catabolism\n\nNutritional Strategies for Enabling Safe Sulfur Catabolism\n\nH2S Production in the Gut\n\nWhy This One Specific Fruit May Help\n\nSulfur Amino Acid Restriction: A Last Resort\n\nSulfur-Rich Vegetables and Sulfur-Inclusive Supplements\n\nH2S Production in the Gut\n\nWhy This One Specific Fruit May Help\n\nWhy This One Specific Fruit May Help\n\nSulfur Amino Acid Restriction: A Last Resort\n\nSulfur Amino Acid Restriction: A Last Resort\n\nSulfur-Rich Vegetables and Sulfur-Inclusive Supplements\n\nSulfur-Rich Vegetables and Sulfur-Inclusive Supplements\n\nExploring the Effects of Sulfur Metabolism Dysregulation\n\nNausea, Vomiting, Abnormal Blood Vessel Growth, Hypoxia, CoQ10, and H2S\n\nPregnancy and the Menstrual Cycle: Nausea, Vomiting, and More\n\nH2S, Vasodilation, Flushing, Headache, and Diarrhea\n\nSulfite and Allergies\n\nSulfite and Testosterone\n\nS-Sulfocysteine, Overstimulation, Palpitations, Pain, and Psychiatric Illness\n\nSulfite and Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nH2S, Obesity, and Diabetes\n\nExploring the Effects of Sulfur Metabolism Dysregulation\n\nNausea, Vomiting, Abnormal Blood Vessel Growth, Hypoxia, CoQ10, and H2S\n\nNausea, Vomiting, Abnormal Blood Vessel Growth, Hypoxia, CoQ10, and H2S\n\nPregnancy and the Menstrual Cycle: Nausea, Vomiting, and More\n\nPregnancy and the Menstrual Cycle: Nausea, Vomiting, and More\n\nH2S, Vasodilation, Flushing, Headache, and Diarrhea\n\nH2S, Vasodilation, Flushing, Headache, and Diarrhea\n\nSulfite and Allergies\n\nSulfite and Allergies\n\nSulfite and Testosterone\n\nSulfite and Testosterone\n\nS-Sulfocysteine, Overstimulation, Palpitations, Pain, and Psychiatric Illness\n\nS-Sulfocysteine, Overstimulation, Palpitations, Pain, and Psychiatric Illness\n\nSulfite and Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nSulfite and Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nH2S, Obesity, and Diabetes\n\nH2S, Obesity, and Diabetes\n\nSpecial Concerns About Molybdenum Cofactor Synthesis\n\nSpecial Concerns About Molybdenum Cofactor Synthesis\n\nDescription: Most people need to be thinking about their sulfur metabolism.",

    "title": "Sulfur Lies At the Crossroads of Obesity and Diabetes",
    "content": "Obesity strongly predisposes to type 2 diabetes. This is not because fat storage promotes diabetes. Rather, it is because running out of room to store more fat causes diabetes.\n\nI explained this in detail in When Fat People Can’t Get Fat Enough and When Lean People Get Fat in All the Wrong Places.\n\nIn brief, when a person’s ability to store fat efficiently is maxed out, fat cells start to smoosh together and block the blood supply to the adipose tissue. Energy in excess of this point raises free fatty acids in the blood, which compete with glucose for utilization. Inflammatory cytokines are released to recruit the immune system to come and reorganize the infrastructure of the fat tissue to accommodate new blood vessels. Those inflammatory cytokines impair energy utilization across the body, arguably to reserve energy for the immune-mediated restructuring of adipose tissue.\n\nThis is compounded by energy overload at the cellular level, causing the preponderance of cells to reject energy molecules like glucose and fatty acids when the demand placed on them to burn these molecules for energy exceeds what they can burn “cleanly” without undergoing damage to their components from reactive oxygen species.\n\nAdipose cells become hypoxic at this point, and the hypoxia response drives new blood vessel formation to accommodate additional fat storage. To the extent this is successful, it increases fat storage and decreases the risk of diabetes.\n\nOne of the principal mediators of the hypoxia response is hydrogen sulfide.\n\nHydrogen sulfide (H2S) is one of three endogenously synthesized gasotransmitters. These are gaseous compounds that act as signaling molecules, and they include nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon monoxide. All three are lethally toxic in excess, but essential in normal, healthy concentrations.\n\nH2S levels are lower in those with diabetes than those without, and lower in diabetics with poorer glycemic control.\n\nConversely, H2S is elevated in morbidly obese subjects, and correlates positively across body fat percentages from 15 to 60%.\n\nWithin obese subjects, H2S is lower in those with elevated fasting glucose.\n\nA body of work on mechanistic effects of H2S suggests that H2S not only increases the formation of new blood vessels needed to expand adipose tissue, but also broadly sensitizes cells to insulin.\n\nToo much H2S poisons mitochondria. H2S itself binds to complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, displacing oxygen, and does the same in hemoglobin. H2S is metabolized to sulfite, which inhibits the citric acid cycle and makes mitochondria excessively permeable to substances that can damage it.\n\nBut the Goldilocks level of H2S is necessary for insulin sensitivity.\n\nCorrelations do not show causation, but mechanistic data from cells and animals demonstrate causation. The correlations imply that the mechanistic data is relevant as a mediator of the divergence between obesity and diabetes in the general population.\n\nThat is, for a given excess energy intake, one has two paths: with greater H2S, one becomes fatter and less likely to become diabetic; with less H2S, one becomes less fat but more likely to become diabetic.\n\nThis is all about where the marginal amount of excess energy goes: does it get locked up in fat stores so that it does not displace glucose for utilization or overload cells that cannot handle it? Or does it float around in the blood, competing for fuel use all over the place and overloading cells that cannot handle it?\n\nHydrogen sulfide is derived from the sulfur amino acid cysteine, which we obtain from dietary protein. Generating hydrogen sulfide from cysteine depends on vitamin B6, iron, niacin, magnesium, and zinc.\n\nRandomized controlled trials of relevant dietary factors cannot parse causal mechanisms with this level of granularity unless they were to involve subcutaneous continuous H2S delivery systems.\n\nHowever, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials done in type 2 diabetics suggest that high-protein diets lower insulin resistance as defined by HOMA-IR (which uses glucose and insulin levels together); that whey protein supplements, which are especially rich in cysteine, lower postprandial glucose; and that supplemental milk protein, driven mainly by whey protein studies, lowers fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR.\n\nThe primary way to address type 2 diabetes should be to Lose Fat Without Losing Muscle and optimize nutrient status with the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening.\n\nThese data suggest that getting sufficient protein, especially from proteins rich in sulfur amino acids (eggs and dairy highest, animal higher than plant) is important to providing the H2S necessary for insulin sensitivity. 0.5-1.0 grams per pound of ideal bodyweight is a good rule of thumb. Getting enough vitamin B6, iron, niacin, magnesium, and zinc is also necessary to generating sufficient H2S. See the Cliff Notes for help getting these vitamins and minerals.\n\nOn the other hand, this also implies that excess H2S could play a role in stubborn fat and difficulty with weight loss. As covered in How to Lose Fat Without Losing Muscle, high protein diets actually help in optimizing body composition. So protein restriction is probably not the best approach here. Rather, promoting optimal H2S clearance by removing any bottlenecks in that process may help ease the body’s resistance to fat loss.\n\nFor that, see my Sulfur Protocol:\n\nClick Here to Get the Sulfur Protocol\n\nSubtitle: Is sulfur behind your stubborn fat?\n\nDescription: Is sulfur behind your stubborn fat?",

    "content": "When you “lose weight,” the health benefits you get are from losing fat.\n\nThese are directly opposed by losing lean mass, which includes weight from muscle, bone, and internal organs.\n\nThere is such a thing as losing too much fat.\n\nFor the average woman, the threshold is probably somewhere around the 17-22% body fat range.\n\nFor the average man, the threshold is probably somewhere in the 6-12% body fat range.\n\nEveryone has their own unique optimal body fat, and that optimal point will vary according to the demands of your life, so always judge your results by whether you are getting healthier or not.\n\nBut if you choose to lose weight, you have to focus on losing fat, not muscle.\n\nUnfortunately, the average person who cuts calories to lose weight will lose between 40% and two-thirds of that weight as lean mass. This ratio is HORRIBLE.\n\nThere is no need whatsoever to lose as much or more muscle as fat, and this shows you that standard calorie-cutting is a tremendously bad way to lose weight.\n\nSo how do we preserve lean mass when losing weight?\n\nExercise more, do not eat less. If you eat junk food, stop, and eat good food. If you are stuffing yourself silly and in an inexorable path toward greater and greater obesity on a daily basis, stop, and eat normal amounts of food. If you are currently eating good food that is keeping you weight stable, do not start by eating less. Rather, get your total resistance training and high-intensity workouts up to six hours per week with the base of this being full-body resistance training and the remainder high-intensity intervals and sprints. Add some moderate intensity work on top of this base and lots of light activity like walking. If you are able to recover from this exercise and feel good, and you are not losing weight fast enough, add more activity. If you hit a wall where you are exceeding your recovery capacity, then it is time to cut food intake.\n\nExercise more, do not eat less. If you eat junk food, stop, and eat good food.

Obtain 1.2-1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight (0.55-0.82 grams per pound of bodyweight). If you insist on losing weight faster than one pound per week, get your protein up to 2.4 grams per kilogram bodyweight (1.1 grams per pound of bodyweight) per day.\n\nEat enough protein.

If you insist on losing weight faster than one pound per week, get your protein up to 2.4 grams per kilogram bodyweight (1.1 grams per pound of bodyweight) per day.\n\nSlower is always better. If you hit the exercise target above and hit the 2.4 g/kg protein target, you can lose up to 2 pounds per week and expect to gain muscle. If you hit the exercise target above and get 1.2-1.8 g/kg protein, you can expect to retain all your muscle if you keep your weight loss down to 2 pounds per week and but gain muscle if your keep your weight loss down to 1 pound per week. If you do not follow the exercise or protein targets above, you must limit your weight loss to a half pound per week.\n\nSlower is always better. If you hit the exercise target above and hit the 2.4 g/kg protein target, you can lose up to 2 pounds per week and expect to gain muscle. If you hit the exercise target above and get 1.2-1.8 g/kg protein, you can expect to retain all your muscle if you keep your weight loss down to 2 pounds per week and but gain muscle if your keep your weight loss down to 1 pound per week. If you do not follow the exercise or protein targets above, you must limit your weight loss to a half pound per week.\n\nThese rules should allow you to retain most of your muscle mass or possibly even increase it while losing fat.\n\nIf the only tool you wield is keeping weight loss to no faster than a half pound per week, you will probably lose 15-20% of your weight as lean mass.\n\nThere is no amount of protein that will completely stop you from losing lean mass.\n\nThe ONLY thing that will stop you from losing any lean mass is exercise. NO EXCEPTIONS.\n\nHere’s the data to back this up.\n\nIn obese postmenopausal women losing weight over five weeks, those who lost less than 0.74 kilograms (1.6 pounds) per week lost only 14% of their weight as lean mass, while those who lost weight faster than that lost 50% of their weight as lean mass.\n\nAn earlier study in women found no difference in 1.1 and 1.9 kilograms per week (2.4-4.1 pounds per week), but 43% of weight loss was lean mass.\n\nIn 126 obese men and women who lost weight over 6 months, those who lost more than ten percent of their bodyweight lost an average of a 1.1 pound per week, 20% of which was lean mass; those who lost between three and ten percent of their bodyweight lost an average of 0.54 pounds per week, and it was only 12.5% lean mass.\n\nThese studies suggest that a half pound per week is the safest rate of weight loss when no other strategies are taken to preserve lean mass, while acceleration of lean mass loss from the 12.5-14% range to the 43-50% range occurs somewhere between 1.6 and 2.4 pounds per week.\n\nWhen resistance training is limited to three days a week, the effect of protein maxes out at 1.6 grams per kilogram bodyweight and about one-third of weight lost will be lean mass on a 40% caloric deficit. Consuming the RDA for protein — 0.8 grams per kilogram of bodyweight or 0.36 grams per pound of bodyweight — led to nearly double the rate of lean mass loss. However, increasing the protein to 2.4 grams per kilogram did absolutely nothing to stop a third of the weight loss being lean mass.\n\nThis indicates that more protein can allow you to lose weight faster, but the maximal effect of protein is to make you lose one third instead of two thirds of your weight as lean mass on a rapid weight loss program.\n\nIf the same caloric deficit is paired with working out for six days a week in a mix of resistance training, sprint intervals, high-intensity interval training, plyometrics, a cycling time trial, and ten thousand steps per day, lean mass stays constant on 1.2 grams per kilogram bodyweight and lean mass is gained on 2.4 grams per kilogram bodyweight).\n\nThe 40% caloric deficit led to weight loss at a speed of about 2 pounds per week in both studies.\n\nThis is the exercise protocol that allowed subjects to gain lean mass while losing fat mass:\n\nThere is no evidence from this study that the particularities drive the effect. Most likely, resistance training is the most preserving of lean mass due to the anabolic effect. However, it is also good to engage different intensities of cardiorespiratory fitness for general health.\n\nIn elite male and female athletes doing an average of 14.6 hours of sports-specific training per week and doing resistance training four times per week practicing progressive overload, and consuming 1.2-1.8 grams of protein per day, a weight loss program lasting four to twelve weeks until the target was reached caused lean mass to stay the same when weight loss was 1.4% of bodyweight per week (for example, a 150-pound person losing 2.1 pounds per week), but go up when weight loss was limited to half that (close to one pound per week).\n\nThis indicates that exercise is far more powerful than protein in minimizing lean mass loss, and is the only tool in the kit that can completely prevent lean mass loss and even lead to lean mass gain while fat is being lost.\n\nSynthesizing these last two studies suggests that once you hit the threshold for sufficient exercise (somewhere around six hours per week of resistance and high-intensity work) and consume at least 1.2-1.8 grams per kilogram bodyweight protein, you should retain all your lean mass when losing two pounds per week and effectively have two options to achieve an increase in lean mass:\n\nSlow the total weight loss to one pound per week.\n\nSlow the total weight loss to one pound per week.\n\nIncrease your protein to 2.4 grams per kilogram bodyweight per day.\n\nIncrease your protein to 2.4 grams per kilogram bodyweight per day.\n\nLose fat, not muscle. 👊\n\nSubtitle: NEVER start with cutting food intake!\n\nDescription: NEVER start with cutting food intake!",

    "content": "Testosterone in males supports lean body mass, mitochondrial function, all aspects of sexual function, calm and confident performance under pressure, and general well being.\n\nTestosterone declines with aging, as does lean body mass and mitochondrial function. Most likely, testosterone is anti-aging.\n\nThe widespread belief that testosterone drives “male pattern baldness” is likely a fundamental misunderstanding driven by the fact that — as I covered in Handling Creatine Side Effects — the more potent 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) shifts energy into defending the brain and penis and away from defending the hair and ovaries. In men, this means that energy scarcity will cause hair loss instead of loss of sexual and cognitive function. The ideal solution would be to resolve energy scarcity. Since testosterone supports mitochondrial function, intervening at the level of blocking its most potent form to save the hair is likely very unwise. And even though hair loss occurs during aging, such a strategy should not be confused with promoting longevity when it is sacrificing the potency of testosterone.\n\nThis article is for men, and for women who are looking for information that will help men. While many of the strategies identified here may help women bring up abnormally low testosterone, and may overlap considerably with strategies to raise estrogen and progesterone, those issues need their own discussion, and the inverse of the strategies identified here should in no way be assumed to help lower testosterone in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) or other situations involving abnormally high androgen levels.\n\nSome types of cancers in both men and women can be promoted by sex hormones. Sex hormone-sensitive cancers are a special topic that are not considered in this article.\n\nThis article assumes we want testosterone to go up in the men who will use these action strategies.\n\nSome of the most simple strategies, like losing body fat, can become complicated. For example, low-carb diets are excellent for losing weight, and high-protein diets are excellent for body composition, yet studies show that low-carb, high-protein diets cut testosterone by an average of 33%. How can we resolve this?\n\nThis article cuts into the data needed to resolve issues like this and comes up with clear action strategies to sustainably increase testosterone in men.\n\nThe Short Answer\n\nThe Short Answer\n\n1.

Try 2-10 grams of salt as long as it does not cause headache or swelling or raise blood pressure. Resources that will help: the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening, How to Track Your Diet With Cronometer, and the Cheat Sheet.\n\nIf overweight, lose weight relying on exercise (six hours per week of resistance training as the main base, with the rest being high-intensity work) to create the caloric deficit. Get down to as low as 12% body fat but reverse course if this lowers testosterone.\n\nIf you need to restrict carbohydrate, favor fat over protein; but if you need to keep protein high, make sure you optimize your sulfur metabolism. Resource to help: My Sulfur Protocol.\n\nAvoid rapamycin and metformin for longevity, but metformin may be beneficial if it is treating diabetes. Get your limiting amino acids. If you have high blood pressure or erectile dysfunction, this may mean 5 grams of arginine will help. If you are an athlete, using alkalinizing techniques to preserve glutamine or supplementing 20-45 grams of glutamine per day may help. 2 grams of trimethylglycine (TMG) per day can work by supporting methylation, but methylation is complex and requires 26 nutrients.

Other herbs that may help include daily doses of 200-250 milligrams of ashwaghanda, 500-600 milligrams of fenugreek, or 500 milligrams of forskolin.\n\nUse of an altitude tent or a simulated altitude mask for three bouts of 10 hours per week can boost testosterone for those willing to go the extra mile.\n\nYour brain decides how much testosterone you should make based on the calculation of nutritional abundance, minus energy needed to defend against external and internal emergencies, with a multiplier that adjusts the level up or down according to the life stage you are in.\n\nThe primary signal of nutritional abundance is leptin, and the secondary signal of nutritional abundance is insulin.\n\nThe primary signal of external emergencies is cortisol.\n\nThe primary signal of internal emergencies is inflammation.\n\nBody fat and food intake are the main influences on leptin and insulin signaling. We need to have enough body fat and eat enough food. However, after a certain point, adipose tissue needs to be restructured to accommodate additional fat, and this is considered an internal emergency that elicits inflammation. Further, body fat produces the enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. Therefore, managing body fat and food intake is a crucial balancing act.\n\nOverlaid on this, there are many nutrients required to make testosterone, and poor nutrient handling can lead to the accumulation of toxins that tank testosterone.\n\nTestosterone is bound in the serum by sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and it is thought that the fraction that is not bound, that is, the free testosterone, is the true measure of what is bioavailable. However, total testosterone should probably not be ignored, because it represents the reserve of what can become free when needed.\n\nUltimately, what you care about are the effects of testosterone, and these can be influenced by other factors, such as androgen receptor sensitivity. Therefore, you should always use factors such as general well being, motivation, focus, calm confidence under pressure, night-time erections, and libido to track your progress, not just testosterone levels.\n\nWith that said, we now move on to the five action strategies.\n\nTestosterone synthesis is most dependent on vitamins A and D, iron, B1, B2, B3, magnesium, zinc, sodium, and chloride.\n\nSteroidogenic factor-1 is a major molecule that cranks up the expression of many genes involved in steroid hormone synthesis, and it is activated by vitamin A. Vitamin A-deficient rats develop testicular atrophy, and this is associated with low activity of steroid-producing enzymes. In testicular cells, vitamin A can both stimulate testosterone production directly and also antagonize the stimulative effect of luteinizing hormone, indicating the possibility that both too little or too much vitamin A could be a problem depending on which effect wins out.\n\nSynthesis of steroid hormones requires three types of enzymes, two of which depend on iron.\n\nIn boys, the combination of vitamin A and iron is just as effective at inducing puberty as androgen replacement therapy.\n\nThis study selected boys with “constitutional delay of growth and puberty,” which is the most common cause of short stature and delayed puberty. It is first evident as delayed growth in the first three years of life, and later evident as a failure to go through puberty at a normal time. The results suggest that this problem is due to deficiencies of vitamins A and iron as a result of their role in testosterone synthesis.\n\nThe study used 6000 IU of vitamin A per week and 12 milligrams of iron per day. This indicates that the amount of vitamin A required for testosterone synthesis is rather small, about 857 IU per day. However, if you do not convert plant carotenoids to retinol effectively and you otherwise do not eat animal products, it would require four eggs per day to hit this retinol intake. So it is far from meaningless.\n\nVitamin D is required to incorporate iron into steroid-producing enzymes correctly. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that vitamin D supplementation increased testosterone, but also increased sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and therefore had no effect on free testosterone.  Observational data suggests total and free testosterone are maximized at 30 ng/mL 25(OH)D, and the most robust finding is that men with 25(OH)D above 20 ng/mL have higher testosterone levels than men with 25(OH)D less than that.\n\nAs with vitamin A, the story with vitamin D is that you want to avoid a deficiency, not that you want to megadose it as a magic bullet to increase testosterone.\n\nThe enzymes that synthesize testosterone also depend on thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), glucose, magnesium and zinc, and are increased by sodium and chloride (salt).\n\nDespite the importance of glucose, we will cover evidence below that replacing carbs with fat increases testosterone.\n\nAs covered in my long-form zinc podcast, zinc deficiency leads to low testosterone. On the other hand, in the context of folate supplementation for improved sperm characteristics in sub-fertile men, randomized trials show no effect of adding zinc supplements on testosterone. Thus, once again the evidence favors avoiding deficiency rather than megadosing a magic bullet.\n\nLittle else exists on these other nutrients in the randomized controlled trial literature. It nevertheless has to be the case that if a given nutrient is needed for testosterone synthesis, there must be some level of deficiency at which testosterone levels are compromised, and therefore deficiencies of all of these nutrients should be avoided.\n\nThese vitamins and minerals are not necessarily the be-all end-all of micronutrient effects.\n\nFor example, a non-randomized, before-and-after study in eight healthy males showed that testosterone increased acutely after 10 milligrams of boron and chronically after seven days. Two more rigorous randomized studies in bodybuilders using 2.5 milligrams (here and here) suggested no effect. The difference could be related to the dose, but the long-term safety of 10 milligrams of boron is unclear. The difference could also be related to the study design, since non-randomized studies are less rigorous. The essentiality of boron is controversial, and the mechanism by which it would raise testosterone is unknown. If it is of benefit, it is probably beneficial to people on carnivore diets since it occurs mainly in the cell walls of plants.\n\nThe MK-4 form of vitamin K2 has been shown to has been to shown to increase testosterone in rats.\n\nAs we will consider in the mTOR section, methylation is important to testosterone synthesis and that depends on 26 nutrients.\n\nSalt — sodium chloride — is the one nutrient that is difficult to uncover a deficiency of with testing, especially since serum levels are tightly regulated and because it isn’t a traditional cofactor for the enzymes but indirectly increases their activity, so it is hard to know what level of salt intake drives optimal enzyme activity.\n\nSalt is 40% sodium, and five grams of sodium is the threshold at which the average person starts experiencing adverse effects, such as headache or swelling. That is 12.5 grams of salt per day.\n\nHowever, many people may experience an increase in blood pressure with much lower levels of salt than this.\n\nThe current official recommendation for sodium is to limit it to 2,300 milligrams to reduce the risk of chronic disease, which means limiting total salt to 5.7 grams per day (including that occurring in natural foods).\n\nThe old official recommendation for potassium was 4.7 grams per day based on a study showing that this amount of potassium completely abolished the rise in blood pressure that otherwise occurred in response to salt in salt-sensitive hypertensives. One or two grams of salt is likely to be the minimal effective dose to do anything physiologically.\n\nRun the comprehensive nutritional screening:\n\nClick Here to Get the Screening\n\nInclude the hair trace mineral analysis add-on for boron status.\n\nAnalyze your nutrient intake with Cronometer:\n\nClick Here for Cronometer Guidance\n\nUse the Cheat Sheet to remedy any nutrient deficiencies that are found, especially those of vitamins A and D, iron, B1, B2, B3, magnesium, zinc, sodium, and chloride:\n\nClick Here to get the Cheat Sheet\n\nExperiment with gram or multi-gram doses of salt, but cut back or balance with potassium if you experience any rise in blood pressure, headache, or swelling; titrate up slowly and use well being, motivation, focus, calm confidence under pressure, night-time erections, and libido as guides prior to retesting testosterone.\n\nIn the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), lower body fat percentages were associated with higher testosterone levels in men, but not in women:\n\nEach dot represents a sample, with women being spread flat on the bottom and men huddling around the red line. The trend seems to be consistent down to the lowest body fat sample, which is 11.4%.\n\nThis figure shows the data smoothed out with the red line representing the average and the blue lines representing the 95% confidence interval:\n\nThe point where the blue lines are hugging flush to the red line represents the area where the data is very strong, and that starts at 17% body fat and higher. The data become especially sparse around 12.7% body fat and lower.\n\nIndeed, if you go back to the first figure and look at the individual dots, there are plenty of people at 12% body fat who have lower testosterone than people at 25% body fat.\n\nIdeologues of “leaner is better” who do not appreciate biochemical individuality may assume this is all a result of confounding from the many other factors that influence testosterone.\n\nHowever, once you accept biochemical individuality you have to see this as part confounding from other variables and part the fact that everyone has an optimal body fat percentage that is unique to them. This is the point at which the confidence the brain perceives from having adequate fat storage outweighs the adrenal stress the brain may feel from worrying about nutritional adequacy and the inflammatory stress the body may feel from having to restructure adipose tissue to accommodate the demands of fat storage.\n\nThinking about it this way, some people with 12% body fat have lower testosterone because they have 12% body fat because for them this leads to inadequate signaling of leptin, the main physiological communicator of adequate total energy stores.\n\nA recent meta-analysis of weight loss trials developed this figure to estimate the gain of total and free testosterone based on age, baseline body mass index (BMI), and the amount of weight lost.\n\nTo summarize the general trend, you will gain more testosterone if you start out more obese and if you lose more weight; if you are young, you gain more free testosterone; if you are older you gain more total testosterone.\n\nTo estimate how much testosterone you could gain by moving from one BMI to the other, print this out, use B and E if you are under 40 or use C and F if you are over 40, and draw a line from your current BMI to your target BMI using a ruler. Then draw a horizontal line at the point where your diagonal meets the center line, and use the absolute increase on the left or the percentage increase on the right.\n\nFor example, using A for the total testosterone increase for all ages pooled together, going from a BMI of 35 to a BMI of 20 is predicted to increase total testosterone by 70% or by 6.5 nanomoles per liter.\n\nOverall the greatest predicted rise in total testosterone is 220% when a man over 40 goes from a BMI of 60 to a BMI of 20, and the greatest rise of free testosterone is 62% when a man under 40 does the same.\n\nThis is clearly an effect of fat loss and not loss of weight (BMI), which is especially clear since the NHANEs study cited above showed that lean mass is positively correlated with testosterone:\n\nThe causation in the NHANES results for both body fat and lean mass are likely bidirectional. Testosterone obviously causes increased lean mass, which is why bodybuilders use anabolic steroids. Less widely appreciated, testosterone supplementation leads to fat loss.\n\nHowever, you cannot do a clinical trial of weight loss that reliably and predictably causes loss of body fat without loss of weight or loss of weight without loss of fat mass. The chart posted above was taken from 44 trials with 1,774 participants. Even this would ideally have a much larger dataset, but the only reason we have a dataset this large is because the less precise but more convenient metric of BMI was used instead of using fat loss.\n\nHow to Lose Fat Mass Without Losing Lean Mass\n\nThis section has been updated and moved to its own article:\n\nHow to Lose Fat Not Muscle\n\nWho Are the Underweight Men With Low Testosterone and Low Fertility?\n\nThe fact that there is no such thing as too little body fat for men in the NHANES data is hard to square with other data showing harms of being underweight.\n\nUnderweight men have lower fertility than men of normal weight. When couples are considered together both partners being underweight reduces fertility by 10%; when underweight men are paired with obese women, fertility drops by 30%. When the status of the female is held constant, underweight men have consistently stronger reductions in fertility than overweight or obese men.\n\nIn people who are not already paired, this is compounded by the fact that underweight and overweight people are less likely to be married, but this is probably driven by perceived attractiveness rather than physiology.\n\nIn NHANES, waist circumference is negatively associated with testosterone, except in underweight individuals, where it is positively associated with testosterone. Since underweight status is based on BMI, which in turn is based on weight, and since waist circumference is more reflective of body fat than body weight is, this suggests that there is some degree of insufficient body fat that compromises testosterone synthesis.\n\nCaloric restriction increases testosterone in obese men and decreases testosterone in men of healthy weight.\n\nI believe the best way to synthesize this data is as follows:\n\nThe underweight man with low testosterone and low fertility has low fat mass and low lean mass because he doesn’t eat enough food.\n\nIf we pair this with the data discussed above for how to lose fat mass without losing lean mass, this all suggests that restricting food intake is a horrible first resort for losing fat mass. Rather, caloric deficits should be established with exercise, because exercise is the most potent way to retain lean mass. After you have achieved two days of full-body resistance training, two days of sprints, and two days of high-intensity interval training or some such equivalent, you can start cutting calories. If you do cut calories you should increase your protein.\n\nI believe this is explained as follows: basal leptin signaling is driven by fat mass; postprandial increases in leptin are driven by insulin; if you have low fat mass and low food intake your leptin declines below that needed to keep testosterone levels high.\n\nThere is almost certainly a level at which body fat itself is too low to sustain testosterone synthesis, but this is not what we see in the typical underweight person. Rather, we see that in certain types of elite athletes.\n\nThis is hard to capture even in male bodybuilders. For example, those using anabolic steroids have the anabolic steroid use confounding testosterone measurements. Nattys during contest prep get their body fat down from 10.5% to 6.6% while their calorie intake goes from 3000 Cal to 2700-2800 Cal, and this tanks their testosterone by 38%. However, we cannot tease out the low body fat from the caloric restriction.\n\nThus, if you are below 11.4% you should certainly consider the possibility that raising body fat could improve testosterone, and due to biochemical individuality anyone who finds testosterone going down during fat loss should consider reversing course, but most men should simply focus on losing fat while retaining lean mass.\n\nIf you are overweight, engage in a weight loss program until your body mass index is at least as low as 25 and continue until your body fat percentage is as low as 12%.\n\nYour caloric deficit should be established primarily by increasing your exercise, not by cutting your food intake. A reasonable target is six hours of exercise per week consisting of resistance training as the primary base, with the remainder based on high-intensity work, including a lot of additional moderate and low intensity exercise for general health. If you keep your protein to at least 1.2 grams per kilogram ideal body weight (0.55 grams per pound), this is sufficient.\n\nIf you know of a dietary strategy that works for you to create easy weight loss, use it. For example, some people do better on low-carb, some low-fat, some calorie counting. Use what you know works for you.\n\nIf you keep your caloric deficit primarily through exercise as described above, keep weight loss to one pound per week.\n\nIf you are unable or unwilling to get your exercise to that level, keep your weight loss to one pound every three or four weeks.\n\nIf a low rate of weight loss is discouraging and makes the weight loss program unsustainable, speed it up, but utilize exercise to the fullest extent possible and get protein up to 2.4 grams per kilogram of ideal bodyweight (1.1 grams per pound).\n\nIf you find your testosterone dropping as body fat goes below 17% or especially 12%, consider reversing course to see if testosterone goes back up. Everyone has a different ideal body fat percentage and yours might be higher than the average person’s.\n\nThe main endocrine regulator of testosterone synthesis in males is luteinizing hormone (LH). LH acts on the testes by increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Insulin lowers cAMP, while glucose deprivation increases the production of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), which enhances the testosterone-boosting activity of cAMP. Thus, carbohydrate and insulin signaling oppose testosterone synthesis at the cellular level.\n\nOn the other hand, carbohydrate also stimulates insulin, which increases leptin. Leptin increases thyroid hormone, which mobilizes cholesterol uptake for general downstream utilization, including the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone. Insulin also acts on the thyroid alongside TSH, to produce thyroid hormone. Leptin acts on the hypothalamus indirectly to increase testosterone synthesis, and directly increases pituitary release of luteinizing hormone. Genetic leptin deficiency in men is associated with lack of puberty and low total and free testosterone. Leptin treatment has induced puberty in a 27-year-old leptin-deficient man. Thus, carbohydrate and insulin signaling favor testosterone synthesis at the physiological level.\n\nOn a single-meal level, the evidence is clear that eating suppresses testosterone, suggesting that the suppression of cAMP and GRP78 overrides the acute increase in leptin after a meal.\n\nTestosterone is highest in the fasting state, and decreases by 15% after a mixed meal. In saliva, it decreases 18% after an oral glucose tolerance test. It even declines 22% after a meal that is 86% fat and 11% carbohydrate, but this high-fat meal still doubles postprandial insulin despite the low carbohydrate intake.\n\nOn the other hand, over the long-term, carbohydrate intake seems to support testosterone synthesis.\n\nA recent meta-analysis found that low-carbohydrate diets lower testosterone; however, when separated by protein intake, only diets that provide more than 35% of calories as protein lower testosterone. Such diets cut testosterone by over one-third. Low-carbohydrate diets that had more fat and less protein were associated with 9% lower testosterone, but this was not statistically significant.\n\nThe conclusion from this is that fat is only slightly less supportive of testosterone synthesis than carbohydrate, while protein tends to suppress testosterone.\n\nThis doesn’t make any sense when explained in the context of exposure to glucose and insulin. Protein stimulates insulin more effectively than fat, and protein can form glucose far more effectively than fat, making protein naturally aligned with carbohydrate in this respect. Yet the studies just cited place protein as the odd man out in suppressing testosterone.\n\nFurther, adding protein to the basal diet does not suppress testosterone. Whey protein supplementation has no effect on testosterone in healthy young men over one day or 12 weeks, and two weeks of it leads to higher testosterone post-training than soy protein despite it being higher in sulfur amino acids. This indicates that extra sulfur amino acids from dietary protein do not suppress testosterone in the absence of carbohydrate restriction.\n\nI believe the explanation is as follows:\n\nAs I covered in The Three Nutrients You Need More Of on a High-Protein Diet, high protein diets raise the need for biotin, B6, and molybdenum. Without molybdenum, high intakes of sulfur amino acids lead to accumulation of sulfite. As I covered in The Unknown Testosterone Nutrient, sulfite decreases testosterone. The niacin used in testosterone synthesis is primarily in the form of NADPH. As I covered in How Sulfite Destroys Your Mental Health, sulfite depletes NADPH. As I covered in Will Longevity Diets Wreck Your Hormones?, carbohydrate restriction increases the breakdown of sulfur amino acids.\n\nIt may be the case, then, that the effects of macros are largely driven by sulfur metabolism when sulfur metabolism is not optimized. When it is optimized, the effects of cAMP, GRP78, and leptin duke it out, with cAMP and GRP78 usually winning over leptin as they do in the acute postprandial period, implying that low carbohydrate diets could raise testosterone given the right opportunity to do so.\n\nIf you have a reason to restrict carbohydrate, focus on fat instead of protein.\n\nIf you have a goal related to body composition or athletics that involves eating a higher-protein diet in the presence of carbohydrate restriction, try optimizing molybdenum status using the Cheat Sheet to preserve or perhaps even increase testosterone levels.\n\nClick Here to get the Cheat Sheet\n\nIf molybdenum fails to work for this purpose, engage in a more comprehensive approach to trouble-shooting with the Sulfur Protocol.\n\nClick Here to Get the Sulfur Protocol\n\nThe mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR — appropriately named after a pharmaceutical since pharmaceutical companies created biology, along with the world and everything therein — increases testosterone synthesis.\n\nThe mechanism is as follows. The first step in synthesizing testosterone is brining cholesterol into the mitochondrion so it can be converted to pregnenolone. This is accomplished by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which activates in response to luteinizing hormone. Various intermediate regulators cause StAR to be opposed by cortisol and metformin but increased by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)\n\nLongevity Drugs Hurt Testosterone\n\nmTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and hydroxethyl-rapamycin) lower testosterone when used in transplant recipients. This is supported by four observational studies that are cross-sectional or case-control in nature, and vaguely supported by one randomized controlled trial that compared a minor difference in the dose between groups and found that the high dose led to non-significantly lower testosterone than the low dose. In one case report, a man became infertile on rapamycin and this resolved by switching to tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant that acts on a different mechanism that does not involve mTOR.\n\nIn animals, monkeys are more vulnerable to fertility effects of rapamycin than rodents. For example, rapamycin causes testicular atrophy in rats at one to three times the dose given to humans, but does the same in monkeys at 0.4-1.0 times the dose given to humans.\n\nThe doses of rapamycin that extend lifespan in mice destroy their healthspan: they cause glucose intolerance, fatty liver, heart fibrosis, and testicular atrophy. Using intermittent dosing instead of chronic dosing gets rid of the glucose intolerance. However, both males and females develop fatty liver, and the males develop heart fibrosis and testicular atrophy.\n\nUsing the lengthening of lifespan in mice to place a bet on this drug extending lifespan in humans is crazy because those same studies show that it obliterates healthspan.\n\nIn any case, blocking mTOR lowers testosterone in humans according to the data available.\n\nMetformin in theory could do the same. However, metformin is usually given to diabetics, and it could lower exposure of the testes to glucose and insulin, which could improve testosterone synthesis. In 106 obese men, 850 milligrams of metformin twice a day seemed to result in slightly less total testosterone at six months that normalized after one year, and very slightly less free testosterone, but neither of these were statistically significant.\n\nThe question remains what metformin does to testosterone when given to healthy people who do not need it to control blood glucose but are looking to leverage it for longevity. My guess is it would decrease testosterone.\n\nmTOR Nutrients Boost Testosterone\n\nNutritionally, mTOR is a sensor of nutrient supply. It response to meals that generate a lot of insulin (driven especially by calories and carbohydrate) and to the amino acids arginine, leucine, asparagine, glutamine, and the methionine derivative and universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine.\n\nWe covered effects of caloric restriction and carbohydrate restriction above.\n\nStudies suggest five grams of L-arginine will boost testosterone:\n\nIn 108 diabetic males with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction with a mean age of 43, 5 grams of L-arginine for eight weeks increased testosterone by 46%, from 11.04 nmol/L to 16.19 nmol/L\n\nIn 108 diabetic males with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction with a mean age of 43, 5 grams of L-arginine for eight weeks increased testosterone by 46%, from 11.04 nmol/L to 16.19 nmol/L\n\nIn 120 males over the age of 60 with erectile dysfunction, 5 grams of L-arginine for six weeks increased testosterone by 19%, from 11.43 nmol/L to 13.7 nmol/L.\n\nIn 120 males over the age of 60 with erectile dysfunction, 5 grams of L-arginine for six weeks increased testosterone by 19%, from 11.43 nmol/L to 13.7 nmol/L.\n\nOn the other hand, in active cyclists and triathletes four weeks of arginine aspartate providing 5.7 grams of arginine and 8.7 grams of aspartate had no effect on testosterone. Similarly, a cocktail of 6 grams of arginine, 4.4 grams of ornithine, and 24 milligrams of B12 for three weeks had no effect in young male weight lifters and bodybuilders.\n\nOn the other hand, in active cyclists and triathletes four weeks of arginine aspartate providing 5.7 grams of arginine and 8.7 grams of aspartate had no effect on testosterone. Similarly, a cocktail of 6 grams of arginine, 4.4 grams of ornithine, and 24 milligrams of B12 for three weeks had no effect in young male weight lifters and bodybuilders.\n\nOne frustrating thing about these studies is they do not look at the background intake of protein, arginine, or any other nutrients. It could be that diabetics and older men with erectile dysfunction all have low arginine status driven by inflammatory arginine degradation or low protein intake, whereas the young athletes have less inflammation and consume more protein.\n\nThe first two studies showed that tadalafil (Cialis) was just as effective or, in the second study, more effective. Tadalafil blocks the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which is made in response to nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is made from arginine. The simplest explanation of this suggests that arginine is boosting testosterone by boosting nitric oxide. The second study showing it to be less effective than the first could reflect other factors dictating nitric oxide production: it depends on zinc and sulfur, it is activated by calcium, it indirectly depends on a variety of other nutrients that are involved in synthesizing and recycling its cofactor, BH4, and it is hurt by oxidative stress. None of this was measured in either study.\n\nSome but not all mechanistic studies indicate that arginine activates mTOR partly through generating nitric oxide, and that this is mediated by cGMP. Nitric oxide promotes testosterone synthesis in rat cells at low concentrations, and hurts testosterone synthesis at high concentrations.\n\nOverall this indicates that arginine will boost testosterone synthesis when its levels are insufficient for normal nitric oxide production. Good indications this could be the case would be high blood pressure and erectile dysfunction; this could be directly tested with a plasma amino acids test.\n\nTwo studies indicate glutamine boosts testosterone:\n\n3 weeks of 0.3 grams per kilogram bodyweight per day L-glutamine (45 grams per day for a 150 pound person) increased salivary testosterone by 24% in combat sport athletes.\n\n3 weeks of 0.3 grams per kilogram bodyweight per day L-glutamine (45 grams per day for a 150 pound person) increased salivary testosterone by 24% in combat sport athletes.\n\nIn boxers, half that dose of glutamine did not have a statistically significant effect on salivary testosterone unless it was combined with alkaline water. The combination had a similar effect as found in the first study. Notably, physical activity generates acidity, which leads to the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate to release ammonia to buffer the acidity.\n\nIn boxers, half that dose of glutamine did not have a statistically significant effect on salivary testosterone unless it was combined with alkaline water. The combination had a similar effect as found in the first study. Notably, physical activity generates acidity, which leads to the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate to release ammonia to buffer the acidity.\n\nThese studies may indicate that athletes blowing through huge amounts of glutamine through high levels of physical activity may benefit from high-dose glutamine in the range of 45 grams per day. They may also benefit from using alkaline water to prevent glutamine depletion, which could cut the dose of glutamine required to boost testosterone in half.\n\nLeucine does not seem to impact testosterone during days or weeks in athletes during intense training periods. This may be because they are already consuming enough leucine from dietary protein.\n\nI cannot find any studies on methionine or asparagine supplementation.\n\nHowever, betaine, also known as trimethylglycine (TMG), increases the conversion of methionine to S-adenosylmethionine, the form of methionine that activates mTOR. In professional youth soccer players, testosterone went down in the placebo group over a 14-week season and went up in a TMG-supplemented group. At the end of the season, testosterone was twice as high in the players receiving 2 grams of TMG per day, one gram two hours before training and the other one hour after training.\n\nFolate does not seem to increase testosterone, and I cannot find trials with B12.\n\nI explained in Your Cells Are Starving for Creatine why TMG is a much simpler test of the effect of methylation than folate or B12.\n\nNevertheless, methylation depends more broadly on 26 nutrients, so whatever your limiting nutrient is may raise testosterone in you personally. The Genova Methylation Panel is the best way to assess methylation.\n\nAltering protein intake from 50 to 82 grams does not impact testosterone over a four-day period, but this may be too short of a time period to see the overall effect.\n\nAs discussed above, whey protein supplementation has no effect on resting testosterone in healthy young men over one day or 12 weeks, but two weeks of it leads to higher testosterone post-training than soy protein despite it being higher in sulfur amino acids. Notably carbohydrate leads to a similar support of post-training testosterone, and carbohydrate is also important for mTOR activation.\n\nThe overall implication of this is that the weakest link in mTOR activation will boost testosterone when the total mTOR stimulation is inadequate. For athletes, this is most likely acidity-induced glutamine degradation. For men with erectile dysfunction, this is most likely arginine-induced nitric oxide production. For the average person, more protein, more carbohydrate, or more calories may be needed to activate mTOR.\n\nAvoid rapamycin and metformin if trying to boost testosterone, but keep metformin if it is successfully treating diabetes.\n\nIf you have high blood pressure or erectile dysfunction, try five grams of L-arginine.\n\nIf you are an athlete, try alkaline water, baking soda, carnosine, or beta-alanine to buffer acidity; 20-45 grams of glutamine may be needed to boost testosterone; more effective buffering of acidity should lower the dose of glutamine required.\n\nTwo grams of trimethylglyine (TMG) may increase testosterone over fourteen weeks. If an athlete, try taking one gram two hours before training and one gram one hour after training.\n\nThe plasma amino acids test in the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening will help narrow down the limiting amino acids in an individual.\n\nClick Here to Get the Screening\n\nAdd the Genova Methylation Panel to determine your personal weak spot in your methylation.\n\nA meta-analysis of tongkat ali supports a strong effect on boosting testosterone at doses between 100 and 400 milligrams per day for between three weeks and six months. Effects generally range from 14% to 55% increases, with roughly twice the effect size in hypogonadal men as in healthy men.\n\nRandomized trials of ashwaghanda support 225 mg increasing testosterone by 11%, 240 mg having no effect, 200 mg increasing testosterone 10%, 600 mg having no effect or increasing testosterone 17%.\n\nRandomized trials of fenugreek support 500 mg increasing testosterone by 23%, or increasing free and total testosterone slightly but without statistical significance, and 600 mg having no effect or increasing testosterone by 11%, or having no effect on total testosterone but increasing free testosterone by 11%.\n\nOne trial of 500 milligrams of forskolin for twelve weeks raised total testosterone by 44% but free testosterone was only 4% higher.\n\nOverall the strongest data for herbal methods lies with tongkat ali at a dose of 100 to 400 milligrams per day.\n\nTry 100-400 milligrams per day of tongkat ali.\n\nIf that doesn’t work, 200-250 milligrams of ashwaghanda, 500-600 milligrams of fenugreek, or 500 milligrams of forskolin may have some benefit.\n\nHypoxia activates the same testosterone-boosting mechanism as mTOR.\n\nIn rats, eight hours per day of hypoxia for 14 days increases testosterone, but in mice, chronic sustained hypoxia for 12 or more hours decreases testosterone progressively over time.\n\nIn boxers, 10-12 hours per day in a hypoxic chamber during evening hours and sleep for 11 days increased testosterone at the 20-hour mark but this increase had started to return toward baseline by day 5. This suggests that everyday use of hypoxia is not optimal even over 11 days and is not sustainable.\n\nIn cyclists, the same protocol was applied except that hypoxia was endured three times per week for four weeks. Testosterone increased 31% from 490 to 645 ng/mL, stayed elevated through the entire study, and went back to baseline after the protocol was stopped.\n\nBy contrast, in eight heathy young men a single resistance training session under hypoxic conditions had no effect on testosterone compared to the same session in normoxic conditions, and in healthy male college students, twice a week resistance training in hypoxic conditions for five weeks did reduce cortisol but had no effect on testosterone. This indicates that a couple hours per week of hypoxia is insufficient stimulus to raise testosterone.\n\nThe intermittent hypoxia training used in boxers and cyclists is called the Live High Train Low routine, and it can be replicated by sleeping in an altitude tent.\n\nHypothetically, it could be replicated by using a simulated altitude mask for the same number of hours per week.\n\nThe best results were obtained from the cycling study where hypoxia was only used on three days per week. Testosterone levels fell back to normal after hypoxia was stopped in the fifth week. Therefore, this should be considered a practice done three times a week to maximize testosterone for durations lasting up to four weeks, and longer use should be checked against its effect on testosterone levels and all other indicators of health and well being.\n\nPersonally, I find this the most cumbersome approach, but if you are really trying to optimize for a performance goal, enduring 30 hours a week of moderate hypoxia might be worth it.\n\nAn altitude tent or a simulated altitude mask used for 10-12 hours three times a week may be used for up to four weeks (possibly longer) to boost testosterone by 31%. To conform to the studied methods most closely, use the tent in the evening and during sleep.\n\nThere is robust evidence that exercise transiently increases testosterone for about 30 minutes, with the intensity of the exercise driving the degree of the testosterone boost.\n\nThis is, of course, important for the physiological effects of the exercise itself but totally meaningless for boosting overall testosterone unless it translates into a cumulative effect.\n\nTwice a week resistance exercise causes testosterone to rise over 14 weeks and then sink back to baseline by the end of 21 weeks.\n\nThere are overall conflicting studies on whether moderate intensity endurance exercise increases or decreases testosterone, while sustained overdoing of high-intensity exercise decreases testosterone.\n\nIn sports players, testosterone is generally lower at the end of the season. For example, I cited a study of youth soccer earlier where testosterone declined over the 14-week season and TMG not only rescued it but raised it. In male power athletes, testosterone went up 21% in the first five weeks of a ten-week season and then went down 19% in the second five weeks. The soccer player study indicates that nutritional support is just as important as rest in order to prevent exercise from tanking testosterone.\n\nOverall the message of exercise is to not go to extremes, and to emphasize adequate recovery and nutritional support.\n\nExercise should be sought out for the benefits to body composition, strength, cardiovascular fitness, balance, stability, and functional movement, and should not be manipulated for a direct effect on testosterone.\n\nHowever, if you are a couch potato, you will likely increase your testosterone by fixing that.\n\nAvoid deficiencies of all vitamins and minerals, but especially of vitamins A and D, iron, B1, B2, B3, magnesium, zinc, sodium, and chloride. Try 2-10 grams of salt as long as it does not cause headache or swelling or raise blood pressure. Resources that will help: the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening, How to Track Your Diet With Cronometer, and the Cheat Sheet.\n\nIf overweight, lose weight relying on exercise (six hours per week of resistance training as the main base, with the rest being high-intensity work) to create the caloric deficit. Get down to as low as 12% body fat but reverse course if this lowers testosterone.\n\nIf you need to restrict carbohydrate, favor fat over protein; but if you need to keep protein high, make sure you optimize your sulfur metabolism. Resource to help: My Sulfur Protocol.\n\nAvoid rapamycin and metformin for longevity, but metformin may be beneficial if it is treating diabetes. Get your limiting amino acids. If you have high blood pressure or erectile dysfunction, this may mean 5 grams of arginine will help. If you are an athlete, using alkalinizing techniques to preserve glutamine or supplementing 20-45 grams of glutamine per day may help. 2 grams of trimethylglycine (TMG) per day can work by supporting methylation, but methylation is complex and requires 26 nutrients. Resources to help: Comprehensive Nutritional Screening, Interpreting the Genova Methylation Panel, My MTHFR Protocol.\n\n100-400 milligrams per day of tongkat ali has the best evidence of an herb. Other herbs that may help include 200-250 milligrams of ashwaghanda, 500-600 milligrams of fenugreek, or 500 milligrams of forskolin.\n\nUse of an altitude tent or a simulated altitude mask for three bouts of 10 hours per week can boost testosterone for those willing to go the extra mile.\n\nLet me know in the comments!\n\nDescription: Testosterone in males supports lean body mass, mitochondrial function, all aspects of sexual function, calm and confident performance under pressure, and general well being.",

    "title": "How Sulfite Destroys Your Mental Health",
    "content": "One in every eight people worldwide are estimated to live with a mental illness, while the prevalence is higher in certain areas. For example, this figure is one in five in the United States.\n\nThe fact that this is framed as “living with” in the statistics betrays that we understand almost nothing about how to deal with mental illness because we can’t shake it from a person’s identity by resolving it.\n\nThis means that there is great hope in considering new ideas about mental illness, since there is such enormous room for upside in getting to the bottom of what causes them and what can be done about it.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nDysfunctional sulfur metabolism has very strong mechanistic support for a major contribution to a large number of mental health problems. Empirical support for this is scattered. Where it exists, it is supportive. Since the empirical research is so behind, looking at your personal sulfur metabolism is a goldmine to put your action plan way ahead of the game and open up doors of hope for far better outcomes.\n\nAnyone with concern over their mental health should apply the screening and any relevant components of my Sulfur Protocol:\n\nClick Here to Get the Sulfur Protocol\n\nDr. Chris Palmer’s theory of Brain Energy is the best unifying theory of mental illness, and I would consider it highly aligned with my argument that Energy Metabolism Governs Everything.\n\nSulfur metabolism is a way of zooming in on one major part of this. Sulfur electrons are burned for energy with sulfate being released as the most oxidized product, similar to how carbs, fat, and protein are burned for energy and carbon dioxide is released as the most oxidized product.\n\nIncompletely oxidized sulfur is used to make the neurotransmitter S-sulfocysteine, which can later reenter the sulfur oxidation process to be burned for energy and release sulfate.\n\nThis is much like how partially oxidized glucose is joined to ammonia released from branched-chain amino acids in the brain to make the neurotransmitter glutamate, which can be converted to the opposing neurotransmitter GABA, and this can later enter the citric acid cycle to be oxidized to carbon dioxide.\n\nOn the other hand, when the sulfur oxidation process is disrupted by genetic impairments or nutrient deficiencies rather than deliberately slowed to synthesize a purposeful neurotransmitter, sulfite can accumulate and act as a mitochondrial toxin. Impairment in mitochondrial energy metabolism will compromise the synthesis of myelin and all kinds of other brain functions, and will acutely disrupt the incredibly energy-intensive handling of all neurotransmitters.\n\nWhile dysregulated sulfur metabolism can both cause and be caused by impaired energy metabolism, there is also a neurotransmitter-centric element to this discussion: sulfite can disrupt the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, which causes gross dysregulation of a variety of neurotransmitters; S-sulfocysteine is an excitatory neurotransmitter that could be seen as glutamate’s sidekick, and this biases the effects of sulfur dysregulation toward excitatory states like anxiety, mania, pain, and hypersensation.\n\nLet’s start with this.\n\nSulfite administration experimentally induces anxiety in rats.\n\nThere are no and will never be any randomized controlled trials testing whether sulfite administration causes anxiety in humans.\n\nHere are the major mechanisms by which sulfite could damage mental health.\n\nS-Sulfocysteine Is an Excitatory Neurotransmitter\n\nSulfite binds to cystine, which consists of two cysteine molecules in a disulfide bond, breaking it into a free cysteine and binding to the other cysteine, forming S-sulfocysteine. S-sulfocysteine activates NMDA receptors, leading to neural excitation.\n\nAs I covered in Maybe THIS Is Why You’re Hangry, S-sulfocysteine is found in everyone’s urine, and it varies 50-fold, suggesting it is a completely unappreciated normal neurotransmitter.\n\nBased on what we know about NMDA function in various mental illnesses, S-sulfocystiene would be predicted to protect against schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder; have a poorly understood and possibly cyclical relationship to bipolar disorder, have a complicated relationship to ADHD; and to increase the risk of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, OCD, addiction, and PTSD.\n\nOveractivation of NMDA receptors could also contribute to chronic pain, which is not a mental illness but increases the risk of mental illness. It likely would have a similar effect by increasing the risk of sleep disorders.\n\nThe well established effects of disorders of sulfite clearance in promoting seizures, tremors, tics, jerks, Parkinsonian movement disorders, gait disorders, and a wide variety of neurological problems probably also increase the risk of mental illness due to the difficulties of life they cause and the anxiety associated with chronic health problems. However, this is not well researched and will be covered further below.\n\nSulfite Depletes NADPH\n\nSulfite has been shown in numerous studies to deplete NADPH by activating NADPH oxidase, which converts molecular oxygen to superoxide while converting NADPH to NADP+. Studies in 1967 and 1975 showed that this is an alternative mechanism of oxidizing sulfite. More recent studies have shown that this oxidizes sulfite to a sulfite radical that leads to many dangerous compounds, that this occurs to much greater degrees when sulfite oxidase activity is deficient, and that this occurs in human cells as it does in other models.\n\nNADPH is needed for both the synthesis and recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine.\n\nGenetic defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase cause phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU decreases the synthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and melanin because it reduces the synthesis of tyrosine. However, the secondary effects of the imbalance in amino acid transport lead to deficient brain levels of methionine, and thus methylation, and of tryptophan, and thus serotonin and melatonin. The drop in brain serotonin is due partly to phenylalanine outcompeting transport of tryptophan to the brain, and partly to phenylalanine’s inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase.\n\nPKU is associated with a 4-fold higher risk of eating disorders, a 3.9-fold higher risk of OCD, a 3.7-fold higher risk of behavioral disorders, a 2-fold higher risk of personality disorders, an 80% higher risk of schizophrenia or other psychosis, a 70% higher risk of attention deficit disorder, anxiety, or phobia, a 60% higher risk of depression, and a 40% higher risk of bipolar.\n\nThus, sulfite depletion of NADPH could mimic PKU and would be expected to similarly contribute to these mental illness risks by distorting neurotransmitter metabolism.\n\nSulfite Depletes B Vitamins\n\nSulfite deactivates folate, thiamin, and vitamin B6.\n\nFrank thiamin deficiency causes Korsakoff’s psychosis, which involves amnesia and the creation of fake memories, called confabulation.\n\nVitamin B6 is involved in the production and interconversion of all amino acid-derived neurotransmitters, and thus is likely to cause similar distortions as PKU that are even more expansive. Frank B6 deficiency causes irritability, depression, confusion, or anxiety, and insomnia.\n\nFolate contributes to mental flexibility, and is protective against anxiety, depression, and especially against rumination and OCD. I covered this in much more detail in Methylate Your Way to Mental Health.\n\nSulfite Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction\n\nSulfite disrupts mitochondrial function by opening up the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which allows many substances to enter or exit the mitochondria that shouldn’t. It also inhibits glutamate and malate dehydrogenases, which disrupts the citric acid cycle and worsens energy status. This is over and above the impairment in respiratory chain activity that occurs in response to hydrogen sulfide accumulation.\n\nThe citric acid cycle is the main source of citrate, which is the primary building block of myelin through its conversion to cytosolic acetyl CoA.\n\nEnergy is required for all functions of the brain and all functions of the rest of the body, but it is especially critical to the acute control of neurotransmission and neurotransmitter function. Without the constant production of energy, the ion gradients that mediate neurotransmission, release neurotransmitters, and clear neurotransmitters from synapses, all collapse.\n\nDisruption of mitochondrial energy metabolism is catastrophic to all aspects of mental health.\n\nThe very common rs1081975 polymorphism in the sulfite oxidase (SUOX) gene has been associated with anorexia.\n\nThe very common rs594445 polymorphism in the molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (MOCOS) gene is associated with a lower risk of methamphetamine addiction and the mania-dominant bipolar 1 disorder. This enzyme adds sulfur to to the activated molybdenum cofactor, allowing it to participate in xanthine metabolism instead of sulfite metabolism. This may reflect less effective driving of molybdenum into xanthine metabolism, allowing more to be available for sulfite clearance, thereby mediating a protective effect on the risk of addiction and mania.\n\nThere are no other data on common polymorphisms that are relatively specific to sulfite accumulation and their association with mental health that I can find.\n\nThe genetic disorder that is most specific to sulfite accumulation is sulfite oxidase deficiency.\n\nA second set of disorders in activating molybdenum to its cofactor form is thought to be relatively but not completely specific to sulfite accumulation, since the activated molybdenum cofactor is needed for sulfite oxidase.\n\nNeonatal-onset disorders of these two types cause intractable seizures, low muscle tone, exaggerated startle reflex, poor feeding, and mild developmental distortions in the face and head. These then progress to spasticity (stiff, rigid, or tight muscles with exaggerated reflexes), profound psychomotor retardation (slowing down of thought and movement), and sometimes dislocation of the lenses in the eyes. In molybdenum cofactor deficiency, xanthine accumulates in addition to sulfite, and this causes kidney stones.\n\n“Late-onset” cases are generally defined as onset in the period from five months of age to two years. Followups rarely make their way into the teenage years and usually are limited to early or mid-childhood. One exception is a girl who presented at age 23, who likely was only diagnosed because her older sister had identical genetics and presented at the age of one.\n\nThis presents a huge problem for looking at mental health. The median age of onset for mental disorders ranges from 8 in the case of phobias and separation anxiety to 31 in the case of mood disorders and 35 in the case of acute and transient psychotic disorders. About a third of all mental disorders onset by age 14, about half by age 18, and about three quarters by age 25.\n\nContrast this with PKU, which was the first inborn error of metabolism added to newborn screening and has been systematically tracked since the 1960s, and is now well tracked from birth throughout the entire world. Due to systematic, proactive screening and prospective followup, we have good data on its relation to mental illness. We have nothing of the sort for sulfite oxidase and molybdenum cofactor deficiency.\n\nThere are eight case reports of late-onset sulfite oxidase deficiency, with very few comments made that can be related to mental health:\n\nIn one, did not report any mental health issues, although at the age of 17 months, episodes involving fevers would cause acute episodes of not recognizing his parents. He was only followed up until he was six and a half years old.\n\nIn one, did not report any mental health issues, although at the age of 17 months, episodes involving fevers would cause acute episodes of not recognizing his parents. He was only followed up until he was six and a half years old.\n\nIn another, a girl was followed up to the age of seven, and the only note about her mental state was that she was mentally retarded but with good comprehension.\n\nIn another, a girl was followed up to the age of seven, and the only note about her mental state was that she was mentally retarded but with good comprehension.\n\nIn another, a girl was followed up to the age of 30 months, and had a developmental quotient under 50, indicating mild intellectual disability (mental retardation).\n\nIn another, a girl was followed up to the age of 30 months, and had a developmental quotient under 50, indicating mild intellectual disability (mental retardation).\n\nIn another, a boy was followed between the ages of 11 and 12 months and shown to have poor alertness.\n\nIn another, a boy was followed between the ages of 11 and 12 months and shown to have poor alertness.\n\nIn the most recent, a 5-year-old girl had “mild delay in social-emotional responses.”\n\nIn the most recent, a 5-year-old girl had “mild delay in social-emotional responses.”\n\nThere are fewer than two dozen reports of late-onset molybdenum cofactor deficiency spread across fifteen reports. Few of them have insights into mental health.\n\nTwo reports taken together demonstrate how mental health is easily ignored in the presence of severe neurological problems, and how diverse the neurological presentations can be across individuals with very similar genetics. The two reports concern two sisters with identical molybdenum cofactor deficiency genetics, born three years apart in a family of five siblings.\n\nThe first report primarily concerns the older of the two sisters. She presented at one year of age with “intermittent jerks” due to “probable seizures,” regression of language skills, motor control problems making feeding difficult (such as choking on solids), irritability and rigid muscle tone upon attempts to comfort involving touch, and involuntary movements. The younger sister was affected biochemically, and suffered from lens dislocation, but her only neurological issue was poor attention span and distractibility, suggestive of an attention deficit disorder.\n\nIn the second report, the younger sister developed a cramped neck and bilateral arm jerks at the age of 23. This progressed to apathy and difficulty swallowing, speaking, and walking. Within five months, she became nearly mute with no facial expression, a distorted voice, a tilted head, rigid muscle tone, parkinsonian movement, mild scoliosis, and tightened knee joints.\n\nIn the second report, no comment was made about the attention deficit that appeared to be emerging at the age of six.\n\nThe two sisters had identical molybdenum cofactor genetics, yet marked neurological problems onsetted at the age of one in the older sister and at the age of 23 in the younger sister. When a snapshot is taken at an early age, it shows remarkable diversity of presentation with similar genetics.\n\nThe way the authors draw attention to the younger sister’s mental health when she had no overt neurological dysfunction yet ignore her mental health once her neurological catastrophe began shows how mental health is easily ignored when symptoms that are more severe and more disorder-specific are present.\n\nWhen you are able to move and speak normally, parents and doctors notice that you get distracted too easily. When these basic functionalities fall apart, they take no notice of how easily you get distracted.\n\nOther molybdenum cofactor deficiency reports mention autism and an IQ of 50, indicating mild intellectual disability (mental retardation) as consequences, though neither of these are mental illnesses.\n\nIn a cohort of patients with autism, seizures, or schizophrenia, rare deletions in the gephyrin gene (GPHN) were found in six individuals, which made them six times more common than in controls (6 out of 8,775 instead of 3 out of /=27,019). In a separate schizophrenia-only cohort where only one individual was found from among 3,391, the incidence was 2.7-fold greater than in controls.\n\nGephyrin is a multi-functional protein that plays a role both in the anchoring of glycine and GABA receptors, and in the activation of molybdenum to its cofactor form. In molybdenum cofactor synthesis, it both performs two steps of the activation and also anchors the several other enzymes of the pathway to the cell membrane as a large complex, where the complex is coupled to the inward transport of molybdenum. Gephyrin is thus a global coordinator of neuroinhibition in the sense that its activation of molybdenum cofactor synthesis will indirectly reduce glutamate receptor activation by S-sulfocysteine while it also directly facilitates inhibitory neurotransmission by glycine and GABA.\n\nTwo cases were reported in that paper of individuals with schizophrenia, both onsetting in the early 20s, but neither case had evidence of seizures or movement disorders and no biochemical analysis was done to show anything related to sulfite accumulation. However, this brings to mind the younger sister in the previous reports who only had attention deficit when her sister had classical signs of sulfite oxidase deficiency, and who only 17 years later developed a severe non-classical neurological catastrophe. That is, the expectation of a “pathognomonic” set of signs is a distraction from the great diversity of neurological outcomes that can be expected from a particular error of biochemistry.\n\nA hypothesis paper from 2020 argued that dysregulation of sulfur catabolism drives treatment resistant schizophrenia. They cite research that schizophrenia is associated with low cysteine, glutathione, hydrogen sulfide, molybdenum, and uric acid. Since sulfur is needed in the activation of molybdenum to its cofactor form, they propose that a low rate of trans-sulfuration compromises molybdenum cofactor synthesis, and this increases sulfite accumulation, which degrades NMDA receptors. The paper they cite on NMDA receptor degradation actually suggests the NMDA receptor expression goes down as compensation for S-sulfocysteine activation.\n\nLow levels of molybdenum seem related but distinct from the main hypothesis, and the findings do not seem consistent. The study they cite found schizophrenia associated with low manganese and molybdenum and high iron and nickel. On the other hand, one study found no relation between schizophrenia and molybdenum levels, while schizophrenia was associated with high manganese and low levels of calcium, magnesium, selenium, and sodium. Another study found schizophrenia associated with high manganese and low copper and selenium, but no relation to molybdenum. A 2020 systematic review concluded that alterations in trace minerals are likely often related to the onset or aggravation of schizophrenia, but the research on specific minerals is too inconsistent to make any conclusions.\n\nMost likely alterations in trace minerals have profound influence on an individual’s risk of onset or aggravation, but the risk is highly idiosyncratic depending on the individual’s diet and nutritional status in interaction with their unique genetic makeup.\n\nIf trans-sulfuration is reduced in schizophrenia, it may be that they don’t have enough S-sulfocysteine, consistent with the widely supported hypothesis that NMDA function is decreased in schizophrenia.\n\nThere are many paths to sulfite accumulation, which is why my Sulfur Protocol is multi-layered with an “assemble your own unique protocol” approach that matches your protocol to your unique circumstances and risks.\n\nIt is interesting that the high manganese shows up as a risk factor in two studies, while low manganese shows up as a risk factor in the one study that identified high iron as a problem. This is very reminiscent of my writings in Manganese Toxicity Is a CoQ10 Deficiency, CoQ10 Deficiency is Sulfur Toxicity, and Iron Overload: Forget What You Thought You Knew. In these articles I outlined how elevated manganese compromises CoQ10 synthesis, which compromises sulfur clearance and leads to accumulation of hydrogen sulfide and sulfite, and how iron overload genes cause manganese overload, but cause it to accumulate in the brain at the expense of the blood. Thus, excess manganese in the brain might be a consistent risk factor for schizophrenia, but this may manifest as high levels in the blood when excess dietary or environmental exposure is the primary cause, but manifest as low levels in the blood when the genetics shifting manganese from the blood into the brain is the primary cause.\n\nNevertheless the role of sulfur in schizophrenia is clearly complicated and a lot needs to be untangled.\n\nMolybdenum levels have no consistent relationship to depression, and there is little else on how its blood levels relate to mental health.\n\nOverall, then, the relationship between sulfur catabolism and mental health is extremely under-researched. However, the mechanistic support for how sulfite and S-sulfocystiene accumulation could destroy mental health is so strong that it makes tremendous sense to be proactive and optimize your sulfur metabolism if you have any concerns about your mental health.\n\nMy Sulfur Protocol covers how to assess your sulfur metabolism using your experience of health issues and your lab work, and how to assemble your personal sulfur protocol using dietary and supplement strategies.

We will see that we never make lactic acid, ever. We make lactate. Making lactate is fundamentally alkalinizing.\n\nWe will take a look at the presentation of glycolysis in the Berg and biochemistry textbooks to see that, on the one hand, they give us everything we need to know to understand that the human body never makes lactic acid, but, on the other hand, they really do not equip us well to understand where acidity does comes from during exercise. This is because they do not consider acid-base balance important enough to completely present the proton balances of the chemical reactions.\n\nFinally, we will cover what does cause muscular fatigue, take a look at the research on lactate supplements, and come to some conclusions about the best way to manage acidity during exercise to maximize performance.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice.

    "content": "Oxalate is a mitochondrial toxin that inhibits pyruvate carboxylase, which is necessary for gluconeogenesis and the citric acid cycle, and pyruvate kinase, which is needed for glycolysis. High-normal levels of oxalate inhibit citric acid cycle activity by 48%.\n\nThis means oxalate could be sapping your energy and causing your blood sugar problems.\n\nOxalate is also a powerful inhibitor of D-lactate dehydrogenase. D-lactate is a normal intermediate in human energy metabolism but if it increases in circulation it is neurotoxic and an impairment in its clearance could raise methylglyoxal levels, which would contribute to diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nOxalate levels in autistics are tripled, suggesting oxalate may contribute to the neurological dysfunction of autism.\n\nAs covered below, oxalate crystals have been found in human brains, offering an explanation for neurological effects that go beyond metabolic disturbances.\n\nOxalate also inhibits the delivery of iron to cells. It has been suggested that oxalate rises high enough to cause anemia in autism.\n\nOxalate also causes kidney stones. Oxalate kidney stones can probably be largely prevented by maintaining urine pH at 6.5 or slightly higher, providing oxalate levels stay within the normal range.\n\nSally Norton collected anecdotal reports of oxalate sensitivity in her book Toxic Superfoods. They include trouble swallowing, acid reflux, and other types of gastrointestinal distress; fatigue, weakness, brain fog, trouble with bodyweight, slow healing; rashes, migraines, hot flashes, cold intolerance, arrhythmias, respiratory problems, light sensitivity, clumsiness, spasms, stiffness, joint problems, or bleeding gums; watery, itchy, or dry eyes; ringing or buzzing in the ears; genital and pelvic discomfort including pressure, soreness, itching, redness, blistering, or stinging; incontinence, and cloudy, sediment-filled, or powdery urine.\n\nYou may come across high oxalate levels on a Genova ION + 40 if you are using the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening.\n\nI recently covered how seed oils might be behind your oxalate problem, and how biotin, folate, and B12 might help in oxalate detoxification, in these articles:\n\nAre Seed Oils Behind Your Oxalate Problem?\n\nAre Seed Oils Behind Your Oxalate Problem?\n\nCan Biotin Help Detoxify Oxalate?\n\nCan Biotin Help Detoxify Oxalate?\n\nCan B12 and Folate Help Detoxify Oxalate?\n\nCan B12 and Folate Help Detoxify Oxalate?\n\nIn this article we talk about whether carbs could be causing your oxalate problem and whether sugar and sugar alcohols could making an independent contribution.\n\nGlucose can be converted to oxalate. Fructose and sugar alcohols have peculiarities in their metabolism that may strongly influence the degree to which they are converted into oxalate. Yet, carb restriction could under some circumstances enhance the synthesis of oxalate. So, some people may find their oxalate goes up from eating carbs, while others may find it goes up when they restrict carbs.\n\nIn this article we look at how to know if carbs, sugar, or sugar alcohols are behind your oxalate problem and what to do about it.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice.

    "title": "H2S Clearance: The Gut Health Factor That Matters More Than Your Microbiome",
    "content": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is produced by human enzymes throughout every organ of the body. It is the second most important “gasotransmitter” after nitric oxide, meaning that it is a gas that acts as an important signaling molecule to help cells decide what to do with their resources and when.\n\nAs I covered in Maybe THIS Is Why You’re Hangry, S-sulfocysteine is made from hydrogen sulfide and is most likely a normal excitatory neurotransmitter that assists glutamate in the way taurine assists GABA and glycine.\n\nThe microbiome also makes hydrogen sulfide. At least 15 different types of microbes, ranging from H. pylori to E. coli to Desulfovibrio and Bilophila wadsworthia, and even certain strains of Lactobacillus can make hydrogen sulfide.\n\nHydrogen sulfide in the gut directly regulates gut function, just like hydrogen sulfide in the brain directly regulates brain function. Various studies suggest hydrogen sulfide slows or speeds intestinal transit, and the net effect probably depends on concentration and context. In irritable bowel syndrome, higher H2S levels are associated with diarrhea rather than constipation. Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is associated with accelerated transit time. This is consistent with animal studies suggesting an H2S-producing microbiome drives diarrhea. Overall, then, we should expect that excessive H2S in the gut is most likely to cause faster transit time and diarrhea than slower transit time and constipation. Faster transit time leads to nutrient malabsorption as well, since food moves faster through the gut than the rate at which nutrients can be optimally absorbed.\n\nFor clarity, not everyone with IBS-D has fast transit time, and transit time is not the only thing impacting the risk of diarrhea. Water retention in the gut rather than in the body proper is another major factor, so it is possible to have diarrhea with normal or slow transit time.\n\nAcute hydrogen sulfide poisoning usually produces nausea and vomiting rather than diarrhea. Thus, hydrogen sulfide probably has to be produced in the gut to cause diarrhea. However, the intestinal cells themselves make hydrogen sulfide, so that doesn’t mean it has to come from the microbiome.\n\nIn much of the body, hydrogen sulfide is pro-growth. In Hydrogen Sulfide Is the New Estrogen, I covered research showing that hydrogen sulfide contributes to breast development, and it is likely a major mediator of estrogen-induced growth in general, including growth of estrogen-responsive cancers. Indeed, hydrogen sulfide is in general a mediator of angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels) in positive contexts like wound healing and muscle hypertrophy, and in negative contexts like cancer growth.\n\nHydrogen sulfide signaling is intimately intertwined with the hypoxia response and likely indispensable to it. A central function of the hypoxia response is to accumulate more iron from food and to mobilize iron throughout the body into hemoglobin synthesis, but it has broadly 100-200 targets, and it includes the regulation of the breathing rate and the formation of new blood vessels.\n\nNow think about this: your gut cells can make their own hydrogen sulfide, and they are exposed to the hydrogen sulfide that your microbiome makes, and they want just the right “Goldilox” level of it so they have the proper rate of motility and blood supply.\n\nDoes it make any sense at all that which blood vessels you grow in distant tissues like your skin or your muscles, and whether your brain excitement gets turned up or down, should be purposefully regulated to be at the whims of random pulses of activity made by little microbes in your gut?\n\nGenerally speaking, your gut is meant to protect you against the environment. The entire gut, from mouth to anus, is “outside” the body. Things must pass through the intestinal cells to enter the “inside” of the body. Thus, the gut produces a massive excess of enzymes that neutralize bioactive chemicals. For example, diamine oxidase is produced by the gut in such excess that dietary histamine should never enter the bloodstream. This is why the histamine in fermented vegetables doesn’t usually cause hives or panic attacks. The intestines also possess the same detoxification enzymes that the liver possesses, and their systematic rejection of foreign chemicals into the feces is the first line of defense against toxins released from our food during digestion.\n\nIt would seem from this that the gut should also have a great excess capacity to clear any hydrogen sulfide that exceeds the level needed for healthy intestinal motility and proper intestinal vascularization.\n\nIndeed, a tissue-based map of the human proteome characterized the expression of human genes in many different tissues. The genes for the two major enzymes involved in clearing hydrogen sulfide — SQOR (or SQRDL as it is labeled in this paper) and ETHE1 — are expressed to a 5.6-fold greater degree in intestinal tissue than in non-intestinal tissue. This supports a massive excess of H2S clearance capacity in the intestines.\n\nSimilarly, the expression of the three genes responsible for endogenous H2S production, CBS, CSE, and MPST (called TST in this paper) was 2.4-fold greater in intestinal tissue than in non-intestinal tissue. Thus, endogenous production of H2S by human enzymes is also enriched in the gut, suggesting that our gut cells are not going to let us get away with relying on the microbiome to synthesize the H2S needed for proper gut function.\n\nThe relative expression of genes is not the only thing that determines flux through the pathways, so we should not read all that much into this, but the fact that H2S-producing genes are 2.4-fold enriched in the intestinal tissue and H2S-clearing genes are 5.6-fold enriched in the intestinal tissue is vaguely suggestive that our clearance capacity is meant to handle half of our H2S coming from our own production and half of it coming from the microbiome.\n\nThe question then arises: what is more important for gut health, maintaining robust clearance of hydrogen sulfide, or controlling its production by the microbiome?\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThe ETHE1 gene codes for the iron-dependent enzyme persulfide diooxygenase (PDO), which is needed to convert hydrogen sulfide to sulfite.\n\nOne of the most classical signs of a genetic ETHE1 deficiency is chronic diarrhea. This is a remarkably consistent finding.\n\nThe others are intellectual disability; low muscle tone that evolves over time into high muscle tone and muscle tension; orthostatic acrocyanosis, which is a blue, white or gray coloring of the skin in response to standing, usually in the hands and feet; petechiae, which are pinpoint spots of red, brown, or purple appearing on the skin, or purpura, which are red and purple patches on the skin and mucous membranes; seizures; loss of mobility; and sometimes loss of speech, swallowing, or social interaction.\n\nVirtually all of the metabolic disturbance is secondary to hydrogen sulfide accumulation.\n\nFewer than 100 clinical cases have been reported worldwide, and most have focused on levels of severity that are considered irreversibly fatal in infancy. However, more recently “mild” cases where diagnosis occurred in the teenage years are being reported, and they too almost always have chronic diarrhea.\n\nThe critical point for our purposes is that this is a monogenic disorder where there is a single causal change to one enzyme involved in endogenous H2S clearance, and no intervention to change the microbiome.\n\nNone of this is to say that the microbiome is not altered, but if it is, it is secondary to poor endogenous H2S clearance.\n\nThis shows you that the normal production of H2S by the intestinal cells and the microbiome combined is sufficient to lead to chronic diarrhea in the absence of H2S clearance.\n\nThe great excess capacity of intestinal H2S clearance is the reason we do not all have chronic diarrhea by default.\n\nA study by Mark Pimental’s group found that IBS patients with diarrhea (IBS-D), when compared to those with constipation (IBS-C), had 59% greater H2S in their breath.\n\nThe stool abundance of two types of H2S-producing microbes, Fusobacterium and one unknown Desulfovibrio species, had a very weak correlation with breath H2S. The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.33, which gives an r-squared of 10.9%. This means that after farming for all the correlations they could find, only 10.9% of the variation could be explained by two cherry-picked bacterial categories.\n\nThe genus Fusobacterium was 68-fold more abundant in IBS-D than IBS-C, while Desulfovibrio was 2.7-fold greater. Many H2S producers were not different between the groups and not all of them were measured.\n\nIt is likely that if they had created a “total H2S-producing composite” taxa, it would have had much lower than 10.9% explanatory power and might not have been different between the groups. There were many other differences in the microbiome that were not considered related to sulfur metabolism.\n\nSince the microbial analysis was incomplete and no attempt was made to aggregate the H2S producers, the best composite index of H2S production in this study is the 59% increase in H2S exhalation.\n\nH2S is a volatile gas. Anywhere that it is produced, it will come out the breath, so long as its production exceeds the local rate of clearance. There is no reason to think H2S in the breath necessarily reflects H2S made in the gut rather than the brain, muscle, liver, or any other tissue.\n\nIf H2S is measured in farts, and the farts have more H2S than the breath, this would be pretty good circumstantial evidence that the H2S is made in the gut.\n\nHowever, that would not tell you it was made by the microbiome, because H2S is also made by intestinal tissue, and intestinal tissue is part of the gut.\n\nThe appropriate assumption is that greater H2S in the breath reflects a greater excess of H2S production over local clearance, and that’s it.\n\nSome but not all comes from the gut, and some but not all that comes from the gut is made by the microbiome.\n\nImpaired H2S clearance should alter the microbiome. For example, in ETHE1 deficiency, the conversion of H2S to sulfite is impaired, but this leads to increased reliance on an alternative route of disposal that leads to accumulation of thiosulfate. Thiosulfate will leave the cell, and, in the intestinal lumen, it can feed Desulfovibrio and other H2S-producing species. Fusobacterium ferments cysteine, and it is conceivable that a backup in H2S clearance would impair cysteine uptake into cells, leaving more to feed this bacterium. No one has looked at the microbiome changes in ETHE1 deficiency, but it seems almost certain there must be big differences.\n\nIn the case of IBS-D, the causation of the condition is up for debate and inquiry. We do not know what happened first: did impaired H2S clearance drive changes to the microbiome, or did something else change the microbiome that increased H2S production?\n\nThis chicken-and-egg problem does not exist for ETHE1 deficiency, because a monogenic genetic disorder is a natural experiment where the change to the genome is fundamentally causal.\n\nSo we can say that we know for a fact blocking endogenous H2S clearance can wreck the gut, but it is still up for debate and inquiry whether increasing the H2S producers of the microbiome can do the same.\n\nThe question then becomes this: can we find anything capable of directly modifying the microbiome in humans to favor more H2S producers and consequently a faster intestinal motility or a greater risk of loose stools or diarrhea?\n\nOur bar to meet is the 59% increase in H2S exhalation associated with IBS-D.\n\nSee the Sulfur Protocol for actionable dietary strategies:\n\nClick Here to Get the Sulfur Protocol\n\nSee The Science Behind the Sulfur Protocol for a review of the research.\n\nUnlike classical neurotransmitters and many hormones, H2S does not carry out its signaling by binding to a receptor on the cell surface. If it did, the H2S coming out in a fecal sample would probably be a good indicator of the H2S available to carry out such signaling, because a proportional amount of H2S would be coming into contact with the cells lining the gut.\n\nHowever, H2S signaling is critically dependent on our endogenous sulfur-metabolizing enzymes inside our own cells.\n\nThe details are still being worked out. However, we know a few things:\n\nGenetic CoQ10 synthesis defects do not cause chronic diarrhea. There is one report of such a defect causing Crohn’s, and a second report of such a defect causing intestinal obstruction, and that is it. These reports also lack descriptions of purpura and petechiae. Thus, while these defects do cause neurological and kidney damage from hydrogen sulfide accumulation, they do not cause aberrant vascularization.\n\nGenetic CoQ10 synthesis defects do not cause chronic diarrhea. There is one report of such a defect causing Crohn’s, and a second report of such a defect causing intestinal obstruction, and that is it. These reports also lack descriptions of purpura and petechiae. Thus, while these defects do cause neurological and kidney damage from hydrogen sulfide accumulation, they do not cause aberrant vascularization.\n\nThe first reports of genetic defects in the CoQ10-dependent SQOR enzyme were published in 2020 and covered three children that had profound neurological disturbances but did not have any gastrointestinal problem, purpura, or petechiae.\n\nThe first reports of genetic defects in the CoQ10-dependent SQOR enzyme were published in 2020 and covered three children that had profound neurological disturbances but did not have any gastrointestinal problem, purpura, or petechiae.\n\nResearch in cell models published this year showed that hypoxia increases H2S, and that H2S promotes neovascularization, but that blocking SQOR abolishes this effect while blocking ETHE1 does not.\n\nResearch in cell models published this year showed that hypoxia increases H2S, and that H2S promotes neovascularization, but that blocking SQOR abolishes this effect while blocking ETHE1 does not.\n\nSeparate studies in cells and mice have shown that CoQ10 plays a direct role in chemoreceptors sensing oxygen, that a buildup of ubquinol relative to ubiquinone is necessary to increase the breathing rate in response to hypoxia, and that full respiratory chain function has to be intact.\n\nSeparate studies in cells and mice have shown that CoQ10 plays a direct role in chemoreceptors sensing oxygen, that a buildup of ubquinol relative to ubiquinone is necessary to increase the breathing rate in response to hypoxia, and that full respiratory chain function has to be intact.\n\nSynthesizing all this evidence leads to the conclusion that the growth of blood vessels and the stimulation of intestinal motility depend on H2S-mediated hypoxia signaling, and that this requires the flow of electrons from H2S to CoQ10 mediated by SQOR and does not require the downstream production of sulfite by ETHE1. When ETHE1 is blocked, all of this signaling increases, causing diarrhea and purpura or petechiae. When SQOR is blocked, the hypoxia signaling cascade is blocked, but the toxic effects of H2S on energy metabolism are enhanced. Thus, in SQOR and CoQ10 deficiencies we see profound neurological dysfunction but without the diarrhea and purpura or petechiae.\n\nSynthesizing all this evidence leads to the conclusion that the growth of blood vessels and the stimulation of intestinal motility depend on H2S-mediated hypoxia signaling, and that this requires the flow of electrons from H2S to CoQ10 mediated by SQOR and does not require the downstream production of sulfite by ETHE1.

When SQOR is blocked, the hypoxia signaling cascade is blocked, but the toxic effects of H2S on energy metabolism are enhanced. Thus, in SQOR and CoQ10 deficiencies we see profound neurological dysfunction but without the diarrhea and purpura or petechiae.\n\nSuddenly it makes complete sense why we could see a 2-3-fold increase in fecal sulfide production without seeing an increase in quantified intestinal transit, loose stools, or diarrhea: because ETHE1 and downstream enzymes are very rich in intestinal cells, and those enzymes are in control of the degree to which H2S mediates increased intestinal motility.\n\nI was unable to find a study looking at breath sulfide and fecal sulfide in the same people, or a study of fecal sulfide in IBS-D.\n\nThis prevents direct comparison of the 2-3-fold increase in fecal H2S content or microbial H2S-producing enzymes with the 59% increase in breath H2S found in IBS-D.\n\nIn contrast to the studies discussed above, an internet search for stories of diarrhea on the carnivore diet suggests it has veritable meme status.\n\nElliot Overton says this is from fat malabsorption, which can be helped with taurine or taurine-containing bile acids, and bitter herbs; bile acid malabsorption, which can be helped with probiotics, butyrate, calcium, psyllium husk, and vitamins A and D; or oxalate dumping, which can be helped with a little chocolate or nuts.\n\nAnthony Chaffee says it’s from coffee, sugar alcohols, or excessive fat consumption.\n\nCarnivore King says this only lasts a month.\n\nMikhaila Peterson says it happens to two out of three people for two to seven days.\n\nOthers report that chronic diarrhea resolves on carnivore.\n\nOne of the problems with using cold-turkey plunges into full carnivore for this question is that a sudden disappearance of fiber from the diet can lead to a complete rearrangement in the physiologically processes needed to maintain proper bulk and hydration of stool.\n\nThe 2014 Nature paper included plenty of cheese, and calcium activates an intestinal receptor that prevents diarrhea.\n\nIn the AJCN 2000 study, even the 600 gram per day meat diet had 220 grams of carbs, and fat was held relatively constant across the diets. It also included cheese at lunch.\n\nThus, the carnivore diarrhea phenomenon probably diverges from these studies as a result of simultaneously purging fiber and calcium from the diet at the same time, and the fact that it tends to self-resolve argues against a shift to an H2S-producing microbiome as the cause. Indeed, that almost certainly happens and persists over time, but the above studies show that it does not reliably lead to changes in intestinal motility or stool quality.\n\nI would not rule out that many people choose carnivore because of existing health problems, so could have underlying problems with sulfur clearance that make them “H2S responders.”\n\nGenetic deficiency of ETHE1 leads to an accumulation of H2S and an excess of its normal hypoxia-related signaling, and this leads to abnormal blood vessel growth and chronic diarrhea.\n\nConditions that block the normal H2S hypoxia-related signaling but allow H2S accumulation to poison energy metabolism, such as CoQ10 deficiency and genetic deficiency of SQOR, cause severe neurological problems but not abnormal blood vessel growth or chronic diarrhea.\n\nIBS-D demonstrating a 59% increase in H2S in the breath implies that H2S, from wherever it came, was not being effectively converted into sulfate by endogenous human enzymes.\n\nThe fact that dietary manipulations can lead to 2-3-fold greater H2S production by the fecal microbiota but do not lead to increased intestinal motility or reports of loose stools or diarrhea suggests that tremendous variance in H2S production can be tolerated so long as function of endogenous human H2S clearance enzymes remains healthy.\n\nThis is consistent with the fact that the human endogenous H2S clearance enzymes are 5.6-fold enriched in intestinal tissue.\n\nThe latest cellular research on H2S signaling implies that human endogenous H2S clearance enzymes are required for it to mediate its signaling and that dysregulated H2S signaling requires an imbalance in the endogenous clearance pathways.\n\nAll of this suggests that when it comes to H2S and your gut health, YOU are far more important than your microbiome.\n\nClick here to get my Sulfur Protocol:\n\nGet the Sulfur Protocol\n\nKeep checking back as my guide to solving sulfur problems will be out soon.\n\nIn the mean time, check out these articles:\n\nHydrogen Sulfide Is the New Estrogen\n\nHydrogen Sulfide Is the New Estrogen\n\nMaybe THIS Is Why You're Hangry\n\nMaybe THIS Is Why You're Hangry\n\nIs THIS Behind Your Muscle Tension?\n\nIs THIS Behind Your Muscle Tension?\n\nWill Longevity Diets Wreck Your Hormones?\n\nWill Longevity Diets Wreck Your Hormones?\n\nThe Unknown Testosterone Nutrient\n\nThe Unknown Testosterone Nutrient\n\nDoes Molybdenum Lengthen Lifespan?\n\nDoes Molybdenum Lengthen Lifespan?\n\nManganese Toxicity Is a CoQ10 Deficiency\n\nManganese Toxicity Is a CoQ10 Deficiency\n\nCoQ10 Deficiency Is Sulfur Toxicity\n\nCoQ10 Deficiency Is Sulfur Toxicity\n\nSubtitle: This key to gut health is all about your own enzymes, not what you're feeding the microbes.\n\nDescription: This key to gut health is all about your own enzymes, not what you're feeding the microbes.",

    "title": "Will Multivitamins Help You Live Longer?",
    "content": "A new observational study suggests multivitamins might slightly decrease your lifespan.\n\nBefore taking a look, let’s put this into its appropriate context.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nBut first, the short answer.\n\nThe best way to get all your micronutrients in is to have an average daily intake of one or two ounces of liver; one or two oysters; a tablespoon or two of unfortified nutritional yeast; several servings of something rich in vitamin C such as bell peppers or strawberries; two to three servings of a calcium-rich food like dairy, bones (but not bone broth), or three to five servings of dark greens (mainly napa cabbage, Chinese mustard greens, bok choy, kale, or broccoli); and a large volume of potassium-rich foods, such as the lean portions of meat, eggs, and milk; legumes, such as lentils, peas, and beans; or tubers such as potatoes; and fruits and vegetables. If you don’t follow these rules of thumb, track your diet in Cronometer (see How to Track Your Diet in Cronometer) to make sure you are hitting all the micronutrient targets. If you cannot meet your micronutrient targets with foods, use a high-quality multivitamin such as Adapt Naturals and Seeking Health Optimal Multivitamin Chewable. If you really want to optimize, run the Comprehensive Nutritional Screening and use the screening and Cronometer to keep tweaking till everything is fully on target.\n\nIf you have a loved one who is not motivated to do any of this, have them take a run-of-the-mill drugstore multivitamin. The data support it having almost no effect on lifespan, but being good for healthspan.\n\nMultivitamins are far from useless.\n\nThey reduce high blood pressure [1] and they provide a number of brain-boosting benefits, ranging from improvements in short-term memory [2] to reductions in stress, anxiety, fatigue, and confusion.[3] Older adults who take multivitamins spend 2.5 fewer weeks a year being sick than those who don’t,[4] and there’s some evidence that multivitamins can even reduce the risk of cataracts,[5] a common cause of cloudy vision.\n\nMultivitamins are especially important in pregnancy, when women are medically advised to take a special formulation known as a prenatal vitamin. Use of multivitamins during pregnancy reduces the risk of miscarriage[6] and birth defects,[7] and it may even reduce the risk of childhood cancers.[8] Multivitamins also seem to prevent preeclampsia,[9] a condition that causes nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure, and headache, and when left untreated can lead to seizures and even the death of the mother.\n\nAt this point, the benefits of multivitamins come to a screeching halt.\n\nMultis do nothing to reduce the risk of heart disease or cancer,[10] the leading causes of death,[11] and as a result they don’t make us live any longer.[12] Although most studies show that multivitamins are safe,[13] they appear to worsen the risk of age-related macular degeneration,[14] the leading cause of blindness in older adults.\n\nThe latest study on lifespan [15] is the largest prospective cohort study to date.\n\nLet’s put it into context by looking at the prior studies on multivitamins and lifespan.\n\nIn 2022, a meta-analysis [16] of three randomized controlled trials with 51,945 subjects found a 6% lower risk of death in those randomized to use of a multivitamin that did not reach statistical significance (OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.87-1.01]). Nearly all the deaths in the included trials occurred in the COSMOS trial, where about 750 out of 21,442 people died over 3.6 years, and those taking a multivitamin seemed to die 7% more slowly but this did not reach statistical significance (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.81-1.08] [n = 21 442])\n\nA 2013 meta-analysis [12] had included a broader number of smaller randomized trials, and had come to similar conclusions: no statistical significance. However, limiting the analysis to 13 primary prevention trials covering 60,967 people brought the all-cause mortality benefit just to the border of statistical significance (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.00). The primary prevention trials were those that tested the use of multivitamins in healthy people instead of those with existing cardiovascular disease or cancer.\n\nThe new study is a prospective cohort study, which does not randomize people to different interventions, but instead asks people what they are already doing and follows them over time. To my knowledge, there are no existing meta-analyses of prior prospective cohort studies assessing the association between multivitamin use and all-cause mortality.\n\nA pubmed search suggests that this new study is one of only seven prospective cohort studies that have reported all-cause mortality, and four of the remaining six were specific to individuals diagnosed with diabetes or cancer. Of the two that remain:\n\nThe German EPIC-Heidelberg Study [17] covered 23,943 and 1,101 deaths over 11 years. The use of any vitamin or mineral supplement, 83% of which was multivitamins, was associated with a statistically significant 14% lower risk of death when adjusted for sex and age alone, but adjusting for education level, physical activity, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, smoking category, intake of meat and meat products, total energy intake, and baseline regular use of NSAIDs reduced the magnitude to a 9% benefit and caused the loss of statistical significance (95% confidence interval 0.8-1.4). Notably, those who did not use supplements at baseline and started using supplements during the study actually had a 58% increased risk of death, which is likely explained by “sick user bias,” where people changed their habits because they ran into health problems.\n\nThe German EPIC-Heidelberg Study [17] covered 23,943 and 1,101 deaths over 11 years.

Notably, those who did not use supplements at baseline and started using supplements during the study actually had a 58% increased risk of death, which is likely explained by “sick user bias,” where people changed their habits because they ran into health problems.\n\nIn a Swedish study [18] of 38,994 men covering 3403 over 7.7 years, multivitamins accounted for a much lower 41% of supplement use. Whether adjusting for age alone or a full model of potential confounders, there was no statistically significant association between use of any supplements and all-cause mortality. Risk ratios seemed slightly favorable (0.96-0.97) for occasional use and completely flat (1.0) for regular use.\n\nIn a Swedish study [18] of 38,994 men covering 3403 over 7.7 years, multivitamins accounted for a much lower 41% of supplement use.

Risk ratios seemed slightly favorable (0.96-0.97) for occasional use and completely flat (1.0) for regular use.\n\nThe Swedish paper lists a reference to a third study that did not turn up in the pubmed search for all-cause mortality:\n\nIn this American study [19] of 47,967 men and women and 14,753 deaths over 7 years, adjusting for age alone led to no association in men or women, while a full adjustment model led to a significant 5% increased risk of death in men but not women, and this was exclusively driven by a ~10% increased risk of death in those who had only been using multivitamins for fewer than five years. In those using them longer than five years, the association was completely flat (0.99-1.00). The duration effect is hard to interpret: either multivitamins killed all the easy victims quickly and left the resilient ones alive (survivorship bias), or it’s another case of sick user bias: people who started fewer than five years before baseline were people who changed their habits because they ran into health problems.\n\nIn this American study [19] of 47,967 men and women and 14,753 deaths over 7 years, adjusting for age alone led to no association in men or women, while a full adjustment model led to a significant 5% increased risk of death in men but not women, and this was exclusively driven by a ~10% increased risk of death in those who had only been using multivitamins for fewer than five years.

The duration effect is hard to interpret: either multivitamins killed all the easy victims quickly and left the resilient ones alive (survivorship bias), or it’s another case of sick user bias: people who started fewer than five years before baseline were people who changed their habits because they ran into health problems.\n\nUsing a broader pubmed search that uses “mortality” instead of “all-cause mortality” or “total mortality” does turn up this last study, but perusing the titles suggests that no other studies on all-cause mortality were missed that were done in general populations rather than disease-specific populations.\n\nThe German finding of a 14% benefit to supplement use at baseline and a 58% increase in the risk of death in those that started later is strongly suggestive of sick user bias (sick people start using supplements). This makes it more likely that the American finding of increased risk of death only with short duration is explained in the same way, and not by survivorship bias (multivitamins kill the easy targets first).\n\nThe Swedish study is the least specific to multivitamins, and the American study is the most specific. The German study is reasonably (83%) specific to multivitamins. In both the German and American studies, associations looked worse in fully adjusted models.\n\nAdjustments are not valid if multivitamins mediate their impact on mortality through the factors being adjusted.\n\nIt is completely plausible that multivitamins could make people more physically active, improve their waist-to-hip ratio, help them quit smoking, change how much they eat, and impact their use of NSAIDs.\n\nFor example, you could fix a nutrient deficiency that is sapping your energy. This makes you feel more energetic. You exercise more. You lose body fat. You stop relying on crutches for your previously miserable life and you quit smoking. This all motivates you to eat better foods and to stop overeating. You live longer.\n\nA statistician then comes and says yes but we have to subtract the life you gained from feeling more energetic, exercising more, losing body fat, stopping smoking, and eating better, and after we subtract that, you did not live longer.\n\nThose adjustments just ruin the information rather than clarifying it.\n\nAs such we should never trust the fully adjusted models over the less fully adjusted ones.\n\nInstead, we should look for the congruence with the randomized controlled trials. These are suggestive of a small longevity benefit to multivitamins that does not always reach statistical significance, and is easiest to see when looking at populations that are healthy at baseline.\n\nThere is better congruence between the randomized controlled trials and the prospective cohort findings that are only adjusted for age or for age and sex. The fully adjusted prospective cohort findings lose their congruence with the randomized trials.\n\nThe latest study on lifespan [15] covered 390,124 generally healthy American adults with more than 20 years of follow-up and 164 ,762 deaths.\n\nDeaths accelerated in the second half of followup, so the two halves were analyzed separately, as followup periods 1 and 2 (FP1 and FP2).\n\nHere are the results:\n\nDaily use is almost completely flat when adjusted for age and sex alone.\n\nNon-daily use looks bad in the first half and good in the second half.\n\nThe fully adjusted models included race and ethnicity, education, BMI, marital status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, coffee intake, family history of cancer, conformation to healthy eating patterns, and use of individual supplements.\n\nSome of these are immutable characteristics, some are unlikely to be directly impacted by multivitamins (marital status, family history of cancer), and others as covered above could be impacted by multivitamin use (BMI, use of cigarettes, alcohol, and coffee, physical activity level, use of other supplements, dietary patterns).\n\nIn the fully adjusted models, daily use has a consistent 4% increase in risk across the time periods that is statistically significant in the first half and just loses significance in the second.\n\nWhether you view this as a non-effect or a small negative effect all hinges on whether you trust all the adjustments.\n\nI would maintain that the model adjusting only for age and sex is more consistent with the rest of the data, which suggests there is a very small longevity benefit to multivitamins that is often hard to show statistical significance for. That ultimately means there is very little impact of multivitamins at all on lifespan.\n\nIf we assume that multivitamins represent the full force and effect of the entire collection of vitamins and minerals, these findings don’t look so great for the power of nutrients. Perhaps they simply mean that vitamins and minerals are great for our brains, our feeling of well being, our energy, and our immune system, but they’re useless for helping us live longer or survive any of the major causes of death, and they’re a gamble when it comes to our eyes. Maybe we should just be happy that nutrition helps prevent a few colds and helps us feel and think better, and leave it at that.\n\nA much more compelling explanation is that, when it comes to getting good vitamin and mineral nutrition, multivitamins help a little bit but they can only go so far.\n\nThere are three big problems with multivitamins: many nutrients just don’t fit into their tiny tablets and capsules; the forms of nutrients within them are often inferior to those found in natural foods; and they are a one-size-fits-all solution, when the full power of nutrition can only be seen when we tailor our diets to our individual needs.\n\nLet’s look at one example of each problem and how it could help explain why multivitamins don’t impact the risk of heart disease, a major leading cause of death.\n\nWhy do multivitamins reduce high blood pressure[1] yet do nothing to reduce the risk of heart disease [10] when high blood pressure itself is a major cause of heart disease?[20]\n\nOne of the nutrients most important to controlling blood pressure is potassium. The most popular multivitamins[21] either don’t have any potassium at all[22-25] or have tiny doses like 50-80 milligrams.[26,27] Yet many people need 4,700 milligrams per day to control their blood pressure.[28] This is about seven times more potassium than all the other nutrients in a multivitamin combined. Even if they wanted to give you all the potassium you need, they couldn’t. It just doesn’t fit!\n\nMultivitamins provide other nutrients that lower blood pressure, but the effect is just too small to bite off a big chunk of heart disease risk. Getting enough potassium, by contrast, could have a much bigger impact on blood pressure that could bite off that chunk, but no one can get enough potassium just by taking a multivitamin. To get enough potassium, we need food. (If not food, it’s scoops of funny-tasting powders or mouthfuls of capsules.)\n\nOther nutrients that are hard to stuff into a multivitamin include calcium, phosphorus, and sodium, a nutrient that gets a bad rap for its ability to raise blood pressure, but is still at the end of the day a nutrient and many people need more of it.\n\nBesides potassium, another nutrient important to heart disease prevention is vitamin K. Vitamin K comes in two forms. K1 is found mainly in unfermented plant foods, such as fresh kale or broccoli. K2 is found in fermented plant foods, such as sauerkraut, or natto, a strong-smelling gooey soybean paste popular in some parts of Japan. K2 is also found in animal foods, like cheese, egg yolks, and meat. K1 is primarily good at supporting blood clotting,[29] while K2 protects against heart disease by preventing calcium from getting stuck in the blood vessels that feed the heart.[30-33]\n\nSome of the most popular multivitamins don’t contain any vitamin K at all,[24] while most have K1 but not K2.[22,23,25-27] Multivitamins would be more likely to protect against cardiovascular disease if they had K2, the more heart-friendly form.\n\nUnlike potassium, it is entirely possible to formulate a multivitamin with a sufficient dose of K2. In fact, there are plenty of examples on the market.[24-36] However, these higher-end supplements tend to be two to three times more expensive than the more popular brands with lower-quality ingredients.\n\nOther nutrients that tend to be found in inferior forms within multivitamins include vitamin B3, B5, B6, B9, B12, choline, vitamin E, copper, and iron.\n\nTo an extent, it’s possible to make up for this problem by investing more of your money into a higher-quality multivitamin. But there are still nutrients like potassium, sodium, calcium, and phosphorus that will never fit in a multivitamin, and, as we will see below, multivitamins can’t be tailored to your unique needs as an individual.\n\nBesides potassium and vitamin K, another nutrient that protects against heart disease is selenium. Selenium helps protect cholesterol from damage, which helps prevent it from blocking arteries.\n\nThere’s just one problem: many of us get too little selenium, but just as many of us get too much.\n\nOne of selenium’s major roles is to protect against “oxidative stress,” which can best be thought of as the wear and tear that occurs to our tissues as we age. Selenium only protects against oxidative stress up to a certain point. Once we hit this sweet spot, extra selenium starts to undermine its own protective role. It actually starts making oxidative stress worse.\n\nOxidative stress is a major cause of heart disease[37], making heart disease an area where the two faces of selenium might reveal themselves. Indeed, that’s exactly what studies of selenium supplements have found. These supplements cut the risk of heart disease in half when they are given to people who don’t get enough selenium from food,[38] but for people who do get enough, they either do nothing or make heart disease worse.[38, 39]\n\nThis could add to our explanation of why multivitamins don’t help with heart disease: their selenium may be helping the people who need it and harming the people who don’t, and these conflicting effects may cancel each other out in the bigger picture.\n\nOxidative stress is also a major contributor to cancer[40] and age-related macular degeneration,[41] the other two areas where multivitamins seem either ineffective or harmful. Could the two faces of selenium help explain these results as well?\n\nFor cancer, studies on selenium supplements are relatively straightforward. They reduce the risk of cancer up to a certain sweet spot; after that, the effect wears off and the risk may even start to increase.[42]\n\nThe studies on age-related macular degeneration are harder to interpret. Selenium is an important component of a supplement known as PreserVision, which decreased the risk of this disease in one study,[43] yet it is also an important component of Centrum Silver, a multivitamin that increased the risk of this disease in a different study.[14] We don’t know why these supplements had opposite effects, but it’s possible that the people who took PreserVision in the first study needed its selenium, while the people who took Centrum Silver in the second study didn’t.\n\nOverall, selenium offers a powerful example of how the one-size-fits-all approach of multivitamins could undermine their ability to protect against heart disease, cancer, and age-related macular degeneration. Since heart disease and cancer are the two leading causes of death, this also helps explain why multivitamins don’t do anything to help us live longer.\n\nAlthough major supplement companies haven’t attempted to solve this problem by making multis with and without selenium, some companies do attempt to account for variable needs by making some multis for men, some for women; some for older adults, some for children; some with iron, and some without.\n\nEven if multivitamin manufacturers eventually develop options to allow people to better control their selenium intake, selenium is only the tip of the iceberg. There are far too many factors that contribute to variation in our needs for nutrients to make a different multivitamin for each one. Just a few few examples: a high-protein diet can triple your need for biotin, birth control can increase your need for B6 by ten- to twenty-fold, going vegetarian can increase your need for zinc and iron, and eating a high-carb diet can nearly double your need for thiamin.\n\nIt would be a huge mistake to say that multivitamins are useless. Overall, even the most run-of-the-mill multivitamins you would find in your local drug store, the kind tested in most scientific studies, do help with blood pressure, cognitive performance, and mental health; keep us from getting sick as often; and help promote healthy pregnancies.\n\nNevertheless, their inability to combat the leading causes of death, and their risky effects on eye health, should cause us to demand something better. We need an approach that can fit all the nutrients we need in the right amounts, that provides the right form of each nutrient, and is individualized to meet each of our unique needs.\n\nStill, not all of us have access to this information or motivation to perfect our diet. Do you have a loved one that you know will do something simple, but who will never even think about thinking about weighing and recording their food or letting a slice of chopped liver touch their lips? One of the most simple things you can do for them is tell them to take a multivitamin.\n\nThe chances that this is going to give them better cognitive function, keep them from getting sick as often, and give a little boost to their energy and well being is quite high.\n\nWhether there is a 4% chance this shortens their life by a tiny bit after statistically adjusting for 17 confounders if they take it for fewer than five years but not if they take it for more than five years and that it will hurt them for the first 15 years and help them for the next 15 years if they don’t take it every day and but will help them by 14% if they take it before they become ill and hurt them by 58% if they take it after they become ill is an open question, but such is the nature of observational studies.\n\nThe most likely effect on lifespan will be the one shown in randomized controlled trials: a barely detectable benefit.\n\nIf you are up to the challenge of getting optimized, you want to take a food-first approach. The best way to get all your micronutrients in is to have an average daily intake of one or two ounces of liver; one or two oysters; a tablespoon or two of unfortified nutritional yeast; several servings of something rich in vitamin C such as bell peppers or strawberries; two to three servings of a calcium-rich food like dairy, bones (but not bone broth), or three to five servings of dark greens (mainly napa cabbage, Chinese mustard greens, bok choy, kale, or broccoli); and a large volume of potassium-rich foods, such as the lean portions of meat, eggs, and milk; legumes, such as lentils, peas, and beans; or tubers such as potatoes; and fruits and vegetables.\n\nMy favorite way to include liver along with kidney and heart is US Wellness 75% Ground Beef With Heart, Kidney, and Liver, pan-cooked as crumbles with one pound in 20 grams of olive oil, 14 grams of taco seasoning, and 4 grams of salt. Any fresh organs from grass-fed animals are excellent. As a “good” rather than “excellent” option, Ancestral liver capsules can substitute. My favorite nutritional yeast is Sari. If fresh oysters won’t do it for you, try Oystermax.\n\nEveryone should track their diet in Cronometer (see How to Track Your Diet in Cronometer) and run a Comprehensive Nutritional Screening at least once to check everything is in order. These can also become powerful tools to help individualize the details of your diet to your unique needs.\n\nIf you don’t follow the above rules of thumb, you need to track your diet in Cronometer to check whether you are missing important nutrients.\n\nIf you made it this far and getting optimized seems overwhelming, take a high-quality multivitamin. Some good examples include Adapt Naturals and Seeking Health Optimal Multivitamin Chewable.\n\nLi, K. et al.

    "title": "D-Lactate: Groundbreaking Research No One Is Talking About",
    "content": "D-lactate is commonly stated to be exclusively a microbial metabolite.\n\nThis is found in assumptions within the medical literature for decades even when it was long-known to be false.\n\nYou can watch the video, listen to the podcast, or keep reading.\n\nThis article is too long for email, so it’s best if you read it on the web site using the share button:\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nThe microbial origin of D-lactate in humans was popularized in a low-quality 2018 paper in which subjects with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth had brain fog improve after taking a course of antibiotics and cutting out probiotics. Thirty percent of them (9 out of 30) had mildly elevated or high-normal urine D-lactate but there was no followup to show the D-lactate went down with the treatment, and thus no clear evidence it was of microbial origin. There was also no separation of the twin treatments of using antibiotics and cutting out probiotics and no untreated control group. Stories in Newsweek and Psychology Today spread the news that probiotics could cause brain fog by causing D-lactic acidosis, a conclusion that was premature in every conceivable respect.\n\nWhile D-lactate is indeed made by bacteria, D-lactate is also inarguably and irrefutably produced by human enzymes.\n\nD-lactate is produced endogenously from methylglyoxal, which can be made from glucose, threonine, or acetone, and is disposed of using the human enzyme D-lactate dehydrogenase, which depends on riboflavin and manganese, is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and almost certainly delivers the electrons to CoQ10, thereby feeding them directly into the respiratory chain. The D-lactate is thereby converted to L-pyruvate, which can then be burned for energy or converted to glucose.\n\nUnlike L-lactate, which is excellent food for the brain, D-lactate is neurotoxic if it reaches levels in plasma that compete with those of L-lactate. High plasma levels of D-lactate lead to confusion, disorientation, slurred speech, difficulty coordinating movements, walking awkwardly, headache, hunger, irritability, aggression, hallucinations, and paranoia.\n\nIn this article, moreover, I will argue the following:\n\nMicrobial contribution to D-lactate in humans under normal circumstances is negligible.\n\nMicrobial contribution to D-lactate in humans under normal circumstances is negligible.\n\nI coin the term “the D-lactate shuttle” to describe a role for D-lactate that should eventually make its way into biochemistry textbooks alongside the malate-aspartate shuttle and the glycerol phosphate shuttle.\n\nI coin the term “the D-lactate shuttle” to describe a role for D-lactate that should eventually make its way into biochemistry textbooks alongside the malate-aspartate shuttle and the glycerol phosphate shuttle.\n\nThe D-lactate shuttle operates alongside these other shuttles to balance the priorities of conserving cytosolic NAD+, reducing cytosolic acidity, bypassing complex I, or generating ATP. It is uniquely useful as a shuttle when there is an absolute deficit of niacin or NAD(H).\n\nThe D-lactate shuttle operates alongside these other shuttles to balance the priorities of conserving cytosolic NAD+, reducing cytosolic acidity, bypassing complex I, or generating ATP.

This contrasts wildly with the common claim that flux through D-lactate is “minuscule.” Most likely D-lactate is produced in considerable quantities in liver and kidney but is rarely secreted into plasma because doing so would risk neurotoxicity.\n\nWhile D-lactate concentrations in human plasma are infinitesimal, when the downstream metabolism of D-lactate and L-lactate are blocked by genetic disorders, the concentrations of the two forms are similar in plasma.

In the 1920s, Neuberg devoted his work to showing that this system was part of mainstream glycolysis.\n\n“The formation of methylglyoxal,” Neuberg wrote, “is the essence of glycolysis.”\n\nThe German biochemist Gustav Georg Embden opposed this view, because in his hands glycolysis generated L-lactate exclusively, while methylglyoxal generated a mix of L- and D-lactate. By 1932, he had amassed a partial picture of glycolysis that “omits the methylglyoxal that was once accepted by Neuberg as the intermediary product in yeast fermentation as well as in glycolytic lactate formation.”\n\nThe German physiologist Otto Warburg worked out one of the steps of glycolysis, and the German biochemist Otto Meyerhoff confirmed much of Embden’s work after his death in 1933 and solidified what is today known as the Embden-Meyerhoff pathway of glycolysis.\n\nIn the 1930s through the 1950s, the details of the substrates and products of the glyoxalase system were worked out. During the 1970s-1990s, the glyoxalase enzymes were purified and characterized in detail.\n\nAlbert Szent-Györgyi won the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine “for his discoveries in connection with the biological combustion process with special reference to vitamin C and the catalysis of fumaric acid.”\n\nSzent-Györgyi was the first to isolate vitamin C, discovered the actin-myosin basis of muscle contraction, and discovered the role of fumarate in the Krebs cycle. He was also interested in ascribing a physiological role to methylglyoxal.\n\nIn 1963, Szent-Györgyi proposed that methylglyoxal was an inhibitor of growth, and that the glyoxalase system promoted growth by clearing away the methylglyoxal.\n\nThis fell out of favor due to the innumerable discoveries of other growth regulators, but I believe it is true, since methylglyoxal sequesters glutathione, and glutathione is needed for growth.\n\nThornalley wrote to Szent-Györgyi asking for guidance in picking up the torch of elucidating the physiological importance of methylglyoxal. Szent-Györgyi wrote back as follows:\n\nI thank you for your kind lines from May 17th, and the reprints that reached me only now. It was very long ago that I was interested in keto-aldehydes and worked on them. Since then I forgot most of what I knew. So to my regret I am unable to advise you. Yours truly, Albert Szent-Györgyi, MD, PhD, NL\n\nI thank you for your kind lines from May 17th, and the reprints that reached me only now. It was very long ago that I was interested in keto-aldehydes and worked on them. Since then I forgot most of what I knew. So to my regret I am unable to advise you. Yours truly, Albert Szent-Györgyi, MD, PhD, NL\n\nThornalley framed this letter and put it on his office wall. He devoted his career to characterizing methylglyoxal as a toxic byproduct of glycolysis that causes diabetes through forming advanced glycation endproducts, with the physiological role of the glyoxalase system as a means of detoxifying methylglyoxal.\n\nI believe this is true, yet as with oxidants (covered in my course on The Antioxidant System), I believe there are both physiological and pathological roles of methylglyoxal.\n\nWhile my own original research on methylglyoxal focused on how dietary factors that impact glutathione levels can alter its accumulation, my doctoral dissertation laid out a synthesis of prior evidence to argue that methylglyoxal plays an important role in regulating redox balance during glycolysis, and serves a role in playing the balance between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.\n\nOn a non-ketogenic diet, methyglyoxal comes primarily from glycolysis. Glucose is phosphorylated, becoming a hexose phosphate, meaning a phosphate of a 6-carbon sugar. It is split into two triose phosphates, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). Their clearance through the rest of the glycolytic pathway is facilitated by NAD+ by the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is stimulated by insulin. Oxidative stress damages DNA, leading to the degradation of NAD+ for use during DNA repair. Though not covered in the figure, energy overload, carbs in excess of what can be burned, or impairments in complex I would raise the NADH/NAD+ ratio and also compromise GAPDH activity.\n\nIf NAD+ is inadequate for the GAPDH reaction, the triose phosphates spontaneously dephosphorylate to form methylglyoxal (MGO).\n\nUnder ketogenic conditions, methylglyoxal is primarily derived from acetone in a two-step process mediated by CYP2E1. This pathway is strengthened by acetone and suppressed by insulin.\n\nThe derivation from threonine is poorly understood and therefore not included in the figure. However, in vitro evidence suggests threonine generates methylglyoxal instead of glycine during its catabolism if coenzyme A (CoA) is limiting, and CoA would be expected to become more limiting under conditions of fatty acid oxidation.\n\nThus, under glycolytic conditions we can expect methylglyoxal to come from glycolysis, while under conditions dominated by fatty acid oxidation we can expect methylglyoxal to mainly come from acetone and threonine.\n\nMethylglyoxal spontaneously reacts with glutathione to form a hemithioacetal adduct that is then acted on by glyoxalase-1 (GLO-1) to form S-D-lactoylglutathione and glyoxalase-2 (GLO-2) to form D-lactate. Glutathione and GLO-1 activity are both increased by insulin and hurt by oxidative stress. Both GLO-1 and GLO-2 are dependent on zinc.\n\nD-lactate is the exclusive product of this pathway, and it is converted to L-pyruvate by D-lactate dehydrogenase.\n\nMethylglyoxal rises in diabetes due to the loss of insulin signaling and the increase in oxidative stress, which acts to increase methylglyoxal formation and decrease its clearance. Methylglyoxal is the principle cause of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in the human body. In diabetics, methylglyoxal and its corresponding AGEs are much higher than in healthy individuals. Animal experiments show that a single treatment with methylglyoxal can cause acute glucose intolerance while a month-long continuous treatment can induce advanced diabetes with pancreatic beta-cell failure.\n\nBut these AGEs don’t occur randomly. They are much more likely to occur on specific enzymes that carry out specific forms of regulation. In fact there are over 100,000 proteins, but proteomic analysis suggests methylglyoxal modifies about 500 of them. Glycolytic enzymes are especially targets. From among these, the single glycolytic enzyme known as fructose 1,6 bisphosphate aldolase (“aldolase”) stands out as the most often modified. Far more importantly, in 1978 research was published suggesting that the dihydroxyacetone phosphate that emerges from the aldolase enzyme starts generating methylglyoxal during its emergence. This extremely close proximity of glycolytically generated methylglyoxal to the active site of aldolase allows it to be uniquely potent in inhibiting this one enzyme.\n\nAldolase generates the triose phosphates that serve as precursors to methylglyoxal, so its inhibition of this enzyme acts as negative feedback against its own production.\n\nIt should also be seen as negative feedback against a rising NADH/NAD+ ratio. Aldolase generates the triose phosphates. NAD+ is needed to clear them away via GAPDH. In doing so, it converts to NADH. If the NADH/NAD+ ratio rises and GAPDH activity falls, continued aldolase activity will put more stress on the ratio by funneling substrate supply into GAPDH and encouraging it to go forward, generating more NADH, despite the scarcity of NAD+. Methylglyoxal’s inhibition of aldolase under this circumstance helps restrain continued worsening of the elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio.\n\nAs covered later, methylglyoxal also helps reduce cytosolic acidity and rewire electrons around complex I of the respiratory chain when complex I is overwhelmed.\n\nMy position on this differs from that of Berg, Tymoczko, Gatto, and Stryer, who in the 10th edition of Biochemistry (2023) refer to this as a “physiologically useless reaction.”\n\nMeanwhile, methylglyoxal can be converted to pyruvate via D-lactate and be burned for energy in the mitochondrion.\n\nWhen fatty acid oxidation predominates, acetone and possibly threonine become the primary sources of methylglyoxal. Fatty acids deliver 2-carbon units to the citric acid cycle without ever delivering 3-carbon units. The two carbons (green) are released as carbon dioxide, precluding the net synthesis of new glucose. The glycerol backbone of triglycerides (not shown) can contribute to some gluconeogenesis. Acetone can also lead to gluconeogenesis through D-lactate.\n\nGluconeogenesis requires aldolase. When methylglyoxal is generated from acetone or threonine, it is not close enough in proximity to inhibit aldolase, so gluconeogenesis proceeds.\n\nThus, glycolytic methylglyoxal acts as negative feedback on the step that increases cytosolic NAD+ demand and acts as a shunt to get around that step. This is a physiologically important way of reducing stress on the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio.\n\nMethylglyoxal from acetone and threonine serves as a gluconeogenic substrate.\n\nIts contribution to diabetes likely represents runaway loss of control in these pathways with vicious cycles of excessive methylglyoxal formation, excessive impairment of specific enzymes, and higher rates of non-specific damage to a broad number of proteins.\n\nEmbden had very early on noted that methylglyoxal could generate D-lactate, but the principle papers identifying D-lactate as the exclusive product of the glyoxalase system were published in 1954 and 1973.\n\nAccording to reviews, the clinical relevance of D-lactate was first noted in grain-fed cattle in 1965 and in a human with short-bowel syndrome in 1979.\n\nHowever, two years prior to the first case of short-bowel syndrome, one case in 1977 was published looking for a genetic inborn error of metabolism as a cause of D-lactic acidosis. A four-year-old was evaluated for his severe mental retardation. He had high urinary excretion of D-lactate, and his plasma D-lactate (0.6 millimoles per liter) was almost as high as his L-lactate (1.7 millimoles per liter). He had very little lactate in his stool. His uric acid was always elevated, which they attributed to competition between D-lactate and urate for renal excretion. Two courses of antibiotics did nothing to reduce the D-lactate. In fact, the second course raised his D-lactate. Noticing structural similarities between D-lactate and threonine, they tried several threonine-loading experiments. The first one raised his D-lactate but the others failed. They published his case as an inborn error of metabolism causing D-lactic acidosis through an unknown mechanism. 42 years later, this puzzle would be solved.\n\nBetween 1979 and 2018, there had been 98 cases of D-lactic acidosis documented in humans, nearly all as a result of short bowel-syndrome, and this repeating finding reinforced the concept that D-lactate is a microbial metabolite.\n\nThe search for a D-lactate dehydrogenase was long befuddled and confused by the belief that it would resemble L-lactate dehydrogenase. Many papers referred to D-lactate dehydrogenase activity being observed, but either did not identify the enzyme, or attributed the activity to a non-specific mitochondrial enzyme.\n\nCompletely overlapping the identification of D-lactate as the exclusive enzymatic endproduct of the glyoxalase system, medical literature regularly made claims that humans do not make D-lactate.\n\nFor example, a 1989 paper stated that while dialysis fluid contains a mix of D- and L-lactate, “mammals produce only the L isomer from pyruvate by the enzyme L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH) as D-LDH is found only in bacteria.”\n\nThis statement is confused on multiple levels. D-lactate is produced by glyoxalase-II, unrelated to lactate dehydrogenase, and the human D-lactate dehydrogenase does not make any form of lactate at all, but rather irreversibly converts D-lactate to L-pyruvate. The first point was known at the time; the second was not.\n\nIn 2002, a putative mitochondrial D-lactate dehydrogenase with two isoforms representing alternative splices of one gene was reported. The same year, an Italian group led by Lidia de Bari showed that D-lactate is effectively transported into mitochondria to be oxidized and possibly used primarily for gluconeogenesis. de Bari showed in 2013 that D-lactate dehydrogenase is a riboflavin-dependent enzyme that is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, facing the the matrix, which is the inside of the mitochondria, and that it facilitates the use of D-lactate to generate ATP.\n\nIn 2019, a Dutch group and then later an Israeli group independently reported genetic cases of D-lactate dehydrogenase deficiency.\n\nThe Dutch paper was a reanalysis of the 1977 case of apparent genetic D-lactic acidosis. At age 40, he still had very high urinary D-lactate, and 0.7 millimoles per liter D-lactate in plasma. He also excreted D isomers of 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid and 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid, which are metabolites of branched-chain amino acids that are usually excreted in L-form when these pathways are impaired.\n\nAntibiotics did nothing to lower D-lactate, showing again that it was not of microbial origin.\n\nA second patient had West syndrome, consisting of infantile spasms and developmental regression, and had a similar excretion profile.\n\nThey found rare homozygous mutations in the putative D-lactate dehydrogenase gene identified in 2002. They deleted the corresponding gene in zebrafish and it made their D-lactate skyrocket. They installed the human wild-type gene into the zebrafish and it got rid of the D-lactate. However, installing the pathogenic variants found in their patients could not get rid of the D-lactate. They thus showed that the gene coded for an enzyme that metabolizes D-lactate and the mutations impair the enzyme’s ability to do that.\n\nThis report solidified the identity of this gene as the LDHD gene, coding for the human D-lactate dehydrogenase.\n\nNotably their inconsistent threonine loading experiments in the 1977 paper could be explained by threonine converting to glycine or methylglyoxal depending on whether CoA is limiting.\n\nAnd it is now clear that the first human clinical case of D-lactic acidosis was not short bowel syndrome but rather was genetic LDHD deficiency.\n\nThe Israeli paper then reported a family with gout that they attributed to mutations in the LDHD gene. D-lactate levels were considerably higher than in the Dutch paper, ranging from 1.52 to 4.7 millimoles per liter. They injected D-lactate into mice and showed it increased uric acid by 54%. They speculated that excess D-lactate is excreted into urine coupled to the reabsorption of uric acid back into the circulation.\n\nThis fits well with the 1977 finding that the first LDHD patient always had elevated uric acid.\n\nA Chinese group in 2023 published a Nature Communications paper reporting the crystal structure of mammalian D-lactate dehydrogenase. They wanted to report the structure of the human enzyme, but it was not soluble in the system they used to manufacture it in E. coli. So they manufactured the mouse enzyme instead.\n\nIt contains riboflavin in the form of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which is bound tightly but not covalently. It is dependent on manganese for activity, with no ability of magnesium to substitute.\n\nIt is totally unrelated to L-lactate dehydrogenase, which depends on NAD+ and does not depend on FAD.\n\nIt works on D-2-hydroxyisovalerate and D-2-hydroxyisocaproate, also found elevated in the Dutch paper. It has higher affinity for them than for D-lactate. However, these substances were found in orders of magnitude lower concentration in the patients of the Dutch paper, showing that this enzyme primarily works on D-lactate due to its higher concentration.\n\nAll of the pathogenic mutations they tested made the enzyme more easily destroyed by heat, suggesting staying cool and avoiding sauna, fever, and excessive exercise would probably help mitigate the disorder. Half of the mutations hurt the binding of riboflavin to the enzyme, suggesting the disorders might be fully rescuable with high-dose riboflavin in those patients.\n\nThis year, in 2024, an Italian group managed to manufacture the soluble human enzyme in E. coli, allowing the study the Chinese group had originally set out and failed to do. They found that, in vitro, it donated electrons to CoQ10. In contrast to the plant version of the enzyme, it cannot donate electrons to cytochrome C. As had been shown previously for bacterial D-lactate dehydrogenases and as was suggested for the human enzyme in the 2013 de Bari paper, they found that it is strongly inhibited by oxalate. In fact, it is the most sensitive enzyme to oxalate inhibition on record.\n\nThus, dietary strategies to improve CoQ10 status or lower oxalate levels might also be helpful in cases of genetic deficiencies.\n\nAccording to the Nature Communications paper, D-lactate production from methylglyoxal is “minuscule.”\n\nThe associated citation implies that this pathway is minor because typical concentrations of D-lactate in human serum are 11 to 70 nanomoles per liter, whereas those of L-lactate are 1 to 2 millimoles per liter. I would argue the optimal range for resting L-lactate is 0.5-0.9 and the postprandial range can extend to 1.2, but we can use 1-2 for this purpose. Since a millimole is one million times a nanomole, the top of that L-lactate range is 28,571 times the top of that D-lactate range.\n\nThere is a huge problem with this reasoning.\n\nFirst, you can never make a conclusion about the quantitative flux through a pathway based on concentrations alone. Concentrations represent a snapshot in an instant of time, whereas flux through the pathway is dynamic and can occur at different speeds. This is like looking at an aerial photograph of a major highway at one instant during the day and using the photo and the photo alone to quantify how many total cars got from point A to point B over the course of the day.\n\nSecond, it assumes their occurrence in serum is an equally important reflection of their occurrence in the body overall, but this may not be true if D-lactate is primarily produced and utilized in gluconeogenic tissues such as liver and kidney without ever being released into the general circulation.\n\nIn the Dutch case report of LDHD deficiency, plasma D-lactate was 0.7 millimoles per liter. In the Israeli case report of LDHD deficiency, plasma D-lactate ranged from 1.57 to 4.7 millimoles per liter. 4.7 millimoles per liter is over 67,142 times the previously cited top of the normal range, and 3-5 times the upper limit of normal for L-lactate. Clearly, then, in humans, the minuscule blood concentrations are driven by effective downstream metabolism of D-lactate, not of minuscule production.\n\nTo compare this to L-lactate, we cannot simply look at genetic deficiencies of L-lactate dehydrogenase, because this enzyme is involved in producing L-lactate as well as clearing it. Further, this enzyme comes in multiple isoforms with different propensities to form or oxidize L-lactate, and complete hereditary absence of the isoform that preferentially oxidizes L-lactate does not elevate L-lactate. The rate of clearance is governed primarily by pyruvate dehydrogenase.\n\nIn a 1996 paper by Saudubray and colleagues, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency was associated with L-lactate in the 2.4-4.6 millimole per liter range, with pyruvate mildly elevated to 0.21-0.45 instead of the 0.08-0.21 range. This yields a range of pyruvate + lactate of 2.61-5.05 millimoles per liter. Another case reported of a 7-year-old boy showed values within this range. The maximal L-lactate in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is nearly identical to the maximal D-lactate in LDHD deficiency, and including the pyruvate to represent the totality of what is blocked by the mutation in the enzyme does not meaningfully change the comparison.\n\nThus, when the clearance of pyruvate, L-lactate, and D-lactate are blocked, the resulting concentrations of L-lactate and D-lactate in plasma are nearly identical.\n\nIn We Really Can Make Glucose From Fatty Acids After All! O Textbook, How Thy Biochemistry Hast Deceived Me!, I cited a 1979 paper that administered radiolabeled acetone to fasting subjects and found that its conversion to glucose could account for up to 11% of gluconeogenesis, which is comparable to an individual amino acid.\n\nThis is equal to production of 10 grams of D-lactate per day from acetone alone during fasting.\n\nI have not seen gluconeogenesis rates from threonine quantified in humans, but in rats, 2.2-3.9% of glucose can come from threonine, which, extrapolated to humans, suggests that an additional 2-3.5 grams of glucose could come from threonine. Threonine has several pathways to glucose, but we can simplify this by saying the maximal flux through D-lactate during extended fasting could be as high as 13.5 grams per day.\n\nThis is very much at odds with Thornalley’s estimation using human red blood cells that 0.089% of glucose generates D-lactate. On 150 grams per day of net carbs, this would be 133 milligrams of D-lactate, and on 300 grams net carbs this would be 266 milligrams of D-lactate.\n\nThis discrepancy can be resolved if D-lactate is made primarily in the liver and kidney and not by red blood cells.\n\nThis is supported by the measured rates of uptake of these compounds from blood to liver. In rats over the course of 1.5 minutes, D-lactate is taken up 80% faster than L-lactate, but it is also sent back into the blood at a higher rate, such that the retention of L-lactate by the liver is 85% higher. In a similar but 2-hour long experiment in dogs, L-lactate was net retained in the liver at a 3.3-fold greater rate than D-lactate.\n\nIn bovine liver, maximal oxidation rates for L-lactate are 2.4-fold higher than for D-lactate.\n\nThis supports a model where the higher oxidation rate for L-lactate in liver drives a greater uptake of L-lactate from blood.\n\nConsider these facts:\n\nThe net clearance of L-lactate from the blood into the liver 1.85-3.3-fold faster than the net clearance of D-lactate.\n\nThe net clearance of L-lactate from the blood into the liver 1.85-3.3-fold faster than the net clearance of D-lactate.\n\nSerum concentrations of L-lactate are 28,571 times greater than D-lactate when their metabolism proceeds normally, but nearly identical when their metabolism is blocked.\n\nSerum concentrations of L-lactate are 28,571 times greater than D-lactate when their metabolism proceeds normally, but nearly identical when their metabolism is blocked.\n\nIf the liver were primarily taking D-lactate up from plasma, it would be completely impossible for it to generate a 28,571-fold differential favoring the L form in blood when it removes the L form faster than the D form.\n\nIf the liver were primarily taking D-lactate up from plasma, it would be completely impossible for it to generate a 28,571-fold differential favoring the L form in blood when it removes the L form faster than the D form.\n\nThis indicates that whereas the tissues that oxidize L-lactate are often different from the tissues that create it (for example, muscle and red blood cells release it, the liver oxidizes it), the tissues that oxidize D-lactate are the same as the tissues that create it (for example, liver and kidney make it, but it never leaves those tissues into the blood).\n\nThis indicates that whereas the tissues that oxidize L-lactate are often different from the tissues that create it (for example, muscle and red blood cells release it, the liver oxidizes it), the tissues that oxidize D-lactate are the same as the tissues that create it (for example, liver and kidney make it, but it never leaves those tissues into the blood).\n\nD-lactate is likely wired to avoid the general circulation so it doesn’t cause neurotoxicity. By contrast, if it is generated in large amounts in tissues such as the liver and kidney without leaving them, this poses no risk of neurotoxicity and, as we shall elaborate on below, can be very useful.\n\nD-lactate production is not by any stretch of the imagination “minuscule” according to available data.\n\nIn short bowel syndrome, surgical removal of large portions of the small intestine causes carbohydrate to mainly be fermented in the colon, with massive bacterial production of D-lactate that can raise concentrations in serum to as high as 20 millimoles per liter.\n\nClearly under those circumstances the gut bacteria can become the overwhelming source of D-lactate production.\n\nBut is the gut microbiome the source of D-lactate under normal circumstances?\n\nOne way to test this would be to look at D-lactate concentrations in germ-free rats or mice, but I cannot find such data.\n\nAnother would be to see if D-lactate is higher in the portal vein than in the general circulation. Since the gut empties into the portal vein before reaching the liver, the excess in the portal vein could hypothetically be due to microbial fermentation. One study in pigs suggests these values are nearly identical. A later paper from the same group presents the data more precisely and again the values are nearly identical.\n\nThe main conclusion from this is that there is no signal of excess D-lactate in the portal blood, and therefore no signal of a significant contribution of the microbiome.\n\nHowever, to be more generous to the microbiome hypothesis, the data are equally consistent with the gut tissue itself releasing no D-lactate at all, unlike the other tissues that release it into general circulation. Since about half of the liver’s blood supply comes from the gastrointestinal tract, we could posit a maximum contribution from the microbiome to be 50% of D-lactate flux that arrives to the liver through the blood.\n\nHowever, when we consider the previous argument that the liver has to be the primary source of its own D-lactate, then even 50% of the flux through the blood is negligible.\n\nThus, the gut bacteria cannot possibly be a major source of D-lactate under conditions other than short bowel syndrome or an equivalent and similar abnormality in the gut.\n\nTo show D-lactate coming from the microbiome, we want to see how much D-lactate falls in germ-free rats and mice and how much it falls in humans treated with antibiotics. In conditions where D-lactate is coming from the gut, it should also be higher in the concentration of the portal vein blood than in the general circulation.\n\nDiabetes is one of the most common afflictions in the modern world, and it both causes and is caused by increased methylglyoxal production and decreased clearance. In rats, diabetes approximately doubles D-lactate in plasma and liver, and this is almost certainly driven by increased flux through methylglyoxal.\n\nAccordingly individuals with diabetes have higher levels of methylglyoxal in their blood.\n\nAnd higher concentrations of methylglyoxal-derived AGEs.\n\nThus, in pathogenic conditions involving increased D-lactate, the microbiome should not be the first suspect by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nThe demonstrated relevance of methylglyoxal to one of the most common pathological conditions afflicting modern society should be the first thing we look at if we find elevated levels of D-lactate.\n\nAs covered in the beginning, I posited a physiological role of methylgyloxal in my 2012 dissertation that involves inhibiting glycolysis in a negative feedback loop under conditions of NAD+ limitation that otherwise favor glycolysis, and acting as a gluconeogenic substrate under gluconeogenic conditions.\n\nWe can now add some further nuances to this.\n\nAs background, mitochondria have two membranes. The area between the two membranes is the intermembrane space. The area inside the inner membrane is the matrix. Organic acids, ATP/ADP, NADH/NAD+, and ions can flow freely through voltage-gated anion channels in the outer membrane into the intermembrane space. The inner membrane has highly selective transporters that control the entry and exit of very specific substances into and out of the matrix.\n\nIn 2002, the de Bari group provided evidence that there are three inner membrane transporters that move D-lactate into the matrix, none of which transport L-lactate:\n\nThe putative D-lactate/H+ symporter moves D-lactate and hydrogen ions (acidity) into the matrix in the same direction.\n\nThe putative D-lactate/H+ symporter moves D-lactate and hydrogen ions (acidity) into the matrix in the same direction.\n\nThe putative D-lactate/oxoacid antiporter moves D-lactate into the matrix coupled to the export of either pyruvate or oxaloacetate.\n\nThe putative D-lactate/oxoacid antiporter moves D-lactate into the matrix coupled to the export of either pyruvate or oxaloacetate.\n\nThe putative D-lactate/malate antiporter moves D-lactate into the matrix coupled to the export of malate.\n\nThe putative D-lactate/malate antiporter moves D-lactate into the matrix coupled to the export of malate.\n\nIn that paper and in their 2013 paper, they showed the following:\n\nD-lactate dehydrogenase is able to donate electrons to a synthetic electron acceptor added experimentally only when mitochondria are turned inside out, not when they are kept intact, which indicates that the enzyme is associated with the inner face of the inner mitochondrial membrane, facing the matrix.\n\nD-lactate dehydrogenase is able to donate electrons to a synthetic electron acceptor added experimentally only when mitochondria are turned inside out, not when they are kept intact, which indicates that the enzyme is associated with the inner face of the inner mitochondrial membrane, facing the matrix.\n\nIt metabolizes D-lactate in a way that leads to ATP production and is not inhibited by the complex I toxin rotenone but is inhibited by antimycin, an inhibitor of complex III.\n\nIt metabolizes D-lactate in a way that leads to ATP production and is not inhibited by the complex I toxin rotenone but is inhibited by antimycin, an inhibitor of complex III.\n\nThey did not explicitly address the question of what accepts the electrons from this reaction.\n\nThe 2023 Nature Communications paper authors stated explicitly that they would withhold any speculation on what the in vivo electron acceptor of this enzyme is.\n\nThe 2024 paper showed that, in vitro, it donates its electrons to CoQ10 but not to cytochrome C.\n\nIf we synthesize these three papers, this enzyme is almost certainly situated on the matrix side of the inner membrane with D-lactate binding on the matrix side, L-pyruvate leaving on the matrix side, and electrons flowing into the CoQ10 pool inside the membrane.\n\nThis figure from a CoQ10 review shows us what we should use as models to think about this.\n\nThe squiggly tadpole-looking thing is CoQ10. The enzymes shown in red are the matrix-facing membrane enzymes that deliver electrons to the CoQ10 pool. All three of these are FAD-containing enzymes that have their substrate-binding and product-releasing sites face the matrix and deliver electrons to the CoQ10 inside the membrane. They include enzymes involved in sulfur catabolism (SQR), proline metabolism (PRODH), and ETFDH, which accepts electrons from fatty acid oxidation, oxidation of branched-chain amino acids, lysine, and tryptophan, and from the scavenging of methyl groups from methylated metabolites of glycine.\n\nThese enzymes are similar to those shown in green, except the green ones have their substrate-binding and product-releasing sites facing the intermembrane space, which is toward the cytosol. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is involved in pyrimidine synthesis and uses riboflavin as flavin mononucleotide (FMN) instead of FAD, while mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase depends on FAD like all the “red” enzymes.\n\nThus, all of the known riboflavin-dependent dehydrogenase enzymes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane either serve as a red or green enzyme in the figure, and donate their electrons to the CoQ10 pool.\n\nWhile more experimental evidence is needed, until anything refutes my supposition, I think it is very clear that D-lactate dehydrogenase belongs in this figure as a “red” enzyme, with D-lactate being converted to L-pyruvate on the matrix side, and the electrons being dropped off at the CoQ10 pool.\n\nFrom any of these sources, CoQ10 then delivers its electrons to complex III of the respiratory chain.\n\nThe advantage of this pathway under glycolytic conditions would be that if the need for glycolysis exceeds the availability of cytosolic NAD+, glycolytic electrons can bypass the NAD+-requiring GAPDH reaction and can further bypass complex I and be donated instead to the CoQ10 pool, thereby removing stress on the NADH/NAD+ ratio caused by the backup at complex I.\n\nI hereby dub this the D-lactate shuttle.\n\nTo my knowledge, I am the first to coin this term here in this article.\n\nBiochemistry textbooks cite two such shuttles that bring electrons from the cytosolic NADH generated in glycolysis into the mitochondria. NADH cannot enter the mitochondria itself, so it is loaded onto malate in the malate-aspartate shuttle or onto glycerol 3-phosphate in the glycerol phosphate shuttle.\n\nTechnically D-lactate is not shuttling electrons from glycolytically generated NADH. Rather, it is shuttling the electrons that would have generated NADH in glycolysis but did not because they bypassed that step.\n\nThe malate-aspartate shuttle generates mitochondrial NADH that is oxidized at complex I.\n\nThe glycerol phosphate shuttle generates mitochondrial FADH2 that is donated directly to the CoQ10 pool.\n\nThe “D-lactate shuttle” generates mitochondrial FADH2 that is donated directly to the CoQ10 pool, just like the glycerol phosphate shuttle.\n\nIt carries electrons from glycolysis into the mitochondrial matrix on an organic acid, just like the malate-aspartate shuttle.\n\nThe glycerol phosphate shuttle shares in common with the D-lactate shuttle the funneling of electrons directly to the CoQ10 pool, but it does not transport the electrons by carrying an organic acid into the matrix.\n\nThus, the overlap in any two of the shuttles is similar to the overlap in any other two of the shuttles, so I consider all three comparable.\n\nThus, I believe it belongs in Biochemistry textbooks alongside these other two shuttles because it achieves very similar objectives in a very similar, yet distinct, manner.\n\nIf we remove methylglyoxal from the picture, this diagram summarizes how L-lactate production and the malate-aspartate and glycerol phosphate shuttles balance priorities of NAD+ demand, acidity, and respiratory chain capacity.\n\nThe first half of glycolysis is acidic because the ATP-mediated phosphorylations generate ADP + H+. The GAPDH reaction requires NAD+ and generates further acidity in the form of 2 NADH + H+.\n\nAcidity impairs the two phosphorylation reactions, which would stop glycolysis, prevent the retention of glucose in the cell, and raise blood glucose. A high ratio of NADH to NAD+ impairs the NAD+-dependent GAPDH reaction. Thus, it is critical to rapidly neutralize the acidity and to remove the NADH.\n\nThe four phosphorylations in the second half of glycolysis neutralize all of the acidity produced in the first half, such that by the time we arrive at pyruvate glycolysis is net neutral.\n\nAs extensively documented by George Brooks and others, nearly all pyruvate is converted to L-lactate under ordinary circumstances, and there is some evidence that lactate dehydrogenase is often physically connected to GAPDH to facilitate the immediate conversion of NADH back to NAD+ so that the NAD+ needed for the GAPDH reaction continues in rapid supply.\n\nL-lactate travels to the intermembrane space where the mitochondrial form of L-lactate dehydrogenase is physically connected to complex IV, and uses the energy released by complex IV to fuel the conversion of L-lactate back to pyruvate.\n\nThe intermembrane space is essentially continuous with the cytosol due to the lack of specificity of the transporters in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Thus, for all practical purposes the conversion of pyruvate to L-lactate in cytosol and the reversal of this reaction in the intermembrane space is net neutral toward cytosolic acidity, NADH, and NAD+. However, it facilitated the spatial distancing of NADH and acidity from the glycolytic enzymes, which is critical to keep them functioning at a high rate.\n\nBoth the malate-aspartate and the glycerol phosphate shuttle absorb one proton per molecule, bringing back the net alkalinity toward the cytosol that had occurred been forged by the production of lactate.\n\nThe distance of L-lactate oxidation from the glycolytic enzymes and its proximity to these shuttles means that L-lactate formation facilitated the net restoration of cytosolic NAD+ and the achievement of net alkaline glycolysis.\n\nIf complex I activity is able to keep up with the NADH produced from glycolysis, the NADH will use the malate-aspartate shuttle. This allows the production of mitochondrial NADH that is oxidized by complex I.\n\nIf complex I cannot keep up, the NADH will use the glycerol phosphate shuttle. This allows the production of mitochondrial FADH2 that is oxidized by the CoQ10 pool.\n\nSkipping over complex I causes a 40% decline in ATP production. Therefore, it is not optimal. However, if complex I is overloaded, it generates reactive oxygen species that will cause broad negative feedback on all aspects of energy metabolism in order to prevent excessive damage to mitochondrial lipids and proteins. Therefore, skipping over complex I is necessary under certain conditions.\n\nNow let’s fit methylglyoxal and D-lactate into this picture.\n\nMethylglyoxal inhibits aldolase, which spares NAD+ by preventing the triose phosphates from driving GAPDH forward through substrate supply.\n\nForming mitochondrial L-pyruvate through methylglyoxal and D-lactate is accomplished with zero input from any form of niacin. No NADH, no NAD+, nothing.\n\nD-lactate carries with it one proton per molecule into the mitochondrial matrix, which helps mitigate cytosolic acidity. However, the short-circuiting of the last half of glycolysis makes glycolysis net acidic. Thus, the putative D-lactate/H+ symporter mitigates the acidity but does not fully neutralize it.\n\nThe main advantage of the D-lactate shuttle compared to the glycerol phosphate shuttle is that it is much stronger in conserving cytosolic NAD+. It prevents its utilization by inhibiting aldolase, and it generates mitochondrial pyruvate without ever using NAD+.\n\nThe main disadvantage is that it is less potent in mopping up the acidity from the first half of glycolysis.\n\nBoth the glycerol phosphate shuttle and the D-lactate shuttle have the disadvantage that bypassing complex I leads to 40% less ATP.\n\nIn reality, these are all happening at the same time. Thus, the cell will turn the volume up or down on these three shuttles depending on its needs to conserve cytosolic NAD+, reduce cytosolic acidity, bypass complex I, or generate ATP.\n\nUnder gluconeogenic conditions, glycolysis is not moving forward. Methylglyoxal is derived from acetone and threonine instead of glycolysis, and it provides D-lactate for use in gluconeogenesis. The D-lactate enters the mitcohondrion in exchange for pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and malate entering the cytosol, all of which can be used for gluconeogenesis.\n\nUnbeknownst to me at the time, months before I finished my dissertation in 2012 a novel human glyoxalase unrelated to GLO-1 and GLO-2 was discovered and dubbed “glyoxalase III.”\n\nThe gene for the DJ-1 protein was discovered as an oncogene in mice in the 1990s and mutations in it were associated with early-onset Parkinson’s in the 2000s. It is now dubbed the PARK7 gene because of this.\n\nAlongside those discoveries, in the 1990s, a gene in E. coli was dubbed GLO-3 for its ability to convert methylglyoxal to lactate without the use of glutathione or any other cofactor.\n\nRealizing that the mammalian DJ-1 gene was related to the E. coli GLO-3, Korean researchers demonstrated cofactor-free glyoxalase activity for human DJ-1 protein in 2012.\n\nIn 2014, they showed that it converts methylglyoxal to L-lactate rather than D-lactate.\n\nThis is true for the human enzyme, but not the plant version. The authors noted that DJ-1 is highly expressed in brain, where LDHD expression is very low. Notably, plants don’t have brains, making the neurotoxicity irrelevant.\n\nIndeed a tissue-based map of the human proteome published the next year found that LDHD is most highly expressed in liver and kidney, with considerable expression in pancreas, moderate expression in heart and skeletal muscle, and low expression in brain and many other tissues. PARK7 has high expression in most tissues, including brain. The gene for GLO-2, which generates D-lactate, has a somewhat similar pattern as LDHD. However, expression in brain is considerably lower than in liver and kidney but not minimal. Further, the gene for glyoxalase-1 (GLO1) is expressed fairly consistently across tissues, with higher expression in brain than kidney and liver.\n\nEmbden must have been correct that methylglyoxal generates a mix of L- and D-lactate.\n\nMethylglyoxal makes a fast and spontaneous adduct with glutathione. The glutathionylated portion will generate D-lactate if the activity of GLO-1 and GLO-2 is high enough. The free portion is available to GLO-3 to make L-lactate. The cell can control the activities of these enzymes to bias the direction toward L-lactate, D-lactate, or — by maintaining a high ratio of GLO-1 to GLO-2 — keeping methylglyoxal sequestered as S-D-lactoylglutathione.\n\nIn the brain I believe we will have to dissect this at the cellular level to make sense of it.\n\nConsider a few points:\n\nAstrocytes feed neurons L-lactate as their primary fuel.\n\nAstrocytes feed neurons L-lactate as their primary fuel.\n\nD-lactate dehydrogenase skips over complex I to feed electrons into the CoQ10 pool. This generates 40% less ATP than feeding electrons into complex I.\n\nD-lactate dehydrogenase skips over complex I to feed electrons into the CoQ10 pool. This generates 40% less ATP than feeding electrons into complex I.\n\nBlocking complex I with rotenone causes Parkinson-like dysfunction in animal models.\n\nBlocking complex I with rotenone causes Parkinson-like dysfunction in animal models.\n\nMutations in PARK7, which block the conversion of methylglyoxal to L-lactate, cause early-onset Parkinson’s in humans.\n\nMutations in PARK7, which block the conversion of methylglyoxal to L-lactate, cause early-onset Parkinson’s in humans.\n\nD-lactic acidosis but not L-lactic acidosis causes neurotoxicity.\n\nD-lactic acidosis but not L-lactic acidosis causes neurotoxicity.\n\nAll this looks to me like D-lactate interferes with L-lactate in the brain by driving electrons into a 40% less efficient means of ATP production.\n\nYou want the versatility to use the D-lactate shuttle when complex I is overwhelmed and NAD+ is in short supply, but you don’t want complex I overwhelmed in the first place, you don’t want NAD+ in short supply, and you don’t want to force neurons to bypass complex I.\n\nThis article is primarily meant as biochemistry education and as a means of setting the record straight on D-lactate, so it is not meant for its practical utility.\n\nHowever, some practical points can be made:\n\nQuest has a plasma D-lactate test.\n\nQuest has a plasma D-lactate test.\n\nHome lactate meters are not isomer-specific. They are hard to compare to venous draws because they are a mix of venous, arterial, and capillary blood, along with interstitial fluid and fluid leaking out from damaged cells. Washing and swabbing the finger, generating large drops of blood, and wiping away the first one to three drops can reduce inaccuracies due to lactate on the surface of the skin or leaking from damaged tissue. If done properly, a large difference between a venous measurement of L-lactate and a finger prick with a home kit done at the same time could indicate the presence of significant D-lactate.\n\nHome lactate meters are not isomer-specific.

Strategies to lower oxalate could include supplementing B6, avoiding vitamin C or collagen, reducing PUFA, consuming 300-400 milligrams of calcium per meal, reducing dietary oxalate, and perhaps optimizing status for biotin, folate, and B12.\n\nSince D-lactate dehydrogenase is the most sensitive enzyme to inhibition by oxalate on record, the possibility that oxalate contributes to autism should be suspected of involving impaired D-lactate clearance.

It is uniquely useful as a shuttle when there is an absolute deficit of niacin or NAD(H).\n\nD-lactate is an important contributor to gluconeogenesis that could account for up to 11% of it and rival an individual amino acid.\n\nWhile D-lactate concentrations in human plasma are infinitesimal, when the downstream metabolism of D-lactate and L-lactate are blocked by genetic disorders, the concentrations of the two forms are similar in plasma. This contrasts wildly with the common claim that flux through D-lactate is “minuscule.” Most likely D-lactate is produced in considerable quantities in liver and kidney but is rarely secreted into plasma because doing so would risk neurotoxicity.\n\nD-lactate should be taken seriously for its potential role in Parkinson’s and in neurological problems generally, for its role in diabetes, and for its extremely underappreciated roles in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the respiratory chain.\n\nOxalate powerfully impairs D-lactate clearance, so D-lactate should be investigated as a potential link between oxalate and autism, and oxalate-lowering strategies should be seen as a way to improve D-lactate clearance and reduce its potential role in diabetes and neurological disorders.\n\nSee the sections on riboflavin, zinc manganese, and glutathione in Testing Nutritional Status: The Ultimate Cheat Sheet, as well as Does CoQ10 Deserve a Spot on Your Longevity Plan? and the How to Detox Manganese guide for managing the relevant nutrients.\n\nLook forward to more Masterclass with Masterjohn Energy Metabolism lessons on the D-lactate shuttle in the context of the related shuttles and the roles of L-lactate coming soon.\n\nDescription: D-lactate is commonly stated to be exclusively a microbial metabolite.",

    "content": "As I covered in Does CoQ10 Deserve a Spot in Your Longevity Plan?, no one should need a supplement of CoQ10 unless they have a genetic impairment or nutrient deficiency hurting its synthesis.\n\nMany people might think that a good way to know if you need more is if your blood levels are low, and that if they’re not, you don’t need more.\n\nThis is not true. I use the Genova ION + 40 as one of the most important nutritional testing panels, and it includes serum CoQ10. I also use the Vibrant America Micronutrient Panel, which includes both serum and white blood cell CoQ10. In my experience, high CoQ10 on Genova often but not always is accompanied by low or low-normal white blood cell CoQ10 on Vibrant, with the Vibrant serum being high or high normal like the Genova measurement.\n\nThese are likely cases of poor CoQ10 transport into cells, for the reasons discussed in Does CoQ10 Deserve a Spot in Your Longevity Plan?, but you would be deeply misled if you had only run the Genova panel.\n\n(Note, I use these panels in the context of the broader Comprehensive Nutritional Screening).\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nWe can put aside transport problems and just consider synthesis problems. You would think if you weren’t synthesizing CoQ10 sufficiently the blood levels would be low, yet this is falsified by the normal blood levels that occur in many CoQ10 synthesis disorders where biopsies are needed to find the low CoQ10 levels.\n\nFor example, CoQ8A patients usually show low CoQ10 in muscle but not skin fibroblasts, and serum levels have not been reported. Serum levels probably haven’t been reported because previous experience with other CoQ10 synthesis disorders showed they were useless.\n\nIn patients with another CoQ10 synthesis defect, PDDS1, serum levels are usually normal despite deficits in skin fibroblasts.\n\nIn the case of both mutations, exercise intolerance and neurological problems such as ataxia (difficulty coordinating movements) and tremors respond to CoQ10 supplementation, something that was not predicted by serum levels but was predicted by biopsies of the correct tissue. But even in biopsied tissue, the fibroblasts work in PDDS1 mutations but not in CoQ8A mutations, so “just biopsy the tissue” doesn’t work either.\n\nThis is probably because different mutations have greater impacts in some tissues than others. It may also be that some tissues get preference over what can be synthesized, so different severities of different mutations might determine whether, say, skin fibroblasts display low levels. And it’s probably also influenced by the bias of which very small numbers of patients were found with which mutations.\n\nWe know very little about how CoQ10 is transported, and almost nothing about how the burden of synthesis is shared by different tissues. For example, recent reviews suggest that it is probably the case that the liver synthesizes more than its own share and plays a role in distributing it other tissues, but this is based mostly on the liver doing this regularly with many other things and not on rigorous data about the liver doing this with CoQ10.\n\nThe point is that you can need CoQ10 to such a degree it is giving you neurological problems and exercise intolerance and your blood levels could be normal or even high.\n\nIn a related matter, I have recently discovered that pathogenic mutations in ANO10 can cause CoQ10 deficiency. This has not been mentioned in any of the reviews I have read about CoQ10 synthesis and transport, but I recently found a 2014 paper showing this is the case.\n\nThe exact role of ANO10 is not well understood. It is thought to be a chloride channel but we are pretty clueless about its physiological function. In two patients, mutations in this gene have been tied to CoQ10 deficiency.\n\nOne patient developed epilepsy at age 7 that was well-controlled through adulthood and then from the ages of 45-50 developed gait disturbance, slurred speech, and ataxia, leading her to be wheelchair-bound. Muscle biopsy showed low CoQ10. Supplementation with 1000 milligrams per day of CoQ10 abolished the epilepsy and within 3-4 months improved the fatigue, mobility, cognition, and the ability to walk.\n\nThe second patient was normal until age 30, then developed a very slowly progressing difficulty walking and slurred speech. By the age of 50 she was using a walker because she had suffered so many injuries from falling. She also suffered from retinal detachment and intention tremor. CoQ10 levels were normal in skin biopsy, borderline low in muscle, and low in plasma. 120-180 milligrams of CoQ10 per day mitigated these problems.\n\nNotice that the second patient showed the opposite pattern as the previous mutations mentioned, with plasma having the greatest signal and muscle the least.\n\nThat doesn’t mean everyone should just willy nilly supplement with CoQ10. As I covered in Does CoQ10 Deserve a Spot in Your Longevity Plan?, in subjects with Parkinson’s, high-dose CoQ10 appeared to cause such problems as orthostatic hypotension, acid reflux, and heart palpitations, there’s an unclearly described case series seeming to suggest it increased the risk of death in ALS patients, and in mice it worsens the age-related loss of hearing and spatial learning and memory.\n\nMy recommendations for CoQ10 supplementation are covered in Does CoQ10 Deserve a Spot in Your Longevity Plan?\n\nMy point here is simple: never dismiss the possibility you might need CoQ10 based on normal or high serum levels.\n\nSubtitle: Whenever they are normal or high, and here's why.\n\nDescription: Whenever they are normal or high, and here's why.",

    "content": "Creatine is like your second mitochondria. Or, the mitochondria’s chief of staff. Or its co-pilot.\n\nYour mitochondria make ATP so you can see clearly, hear accurately, digest your food, power your brain, show off your your shiny skin, lift heavy things, and perform your best at the challenges you face. They do that all with the help of creatine.\n\nCreatine is responsible for spreading the impact of mitochondrial ATP production into the general area of the cell known as the cytosol, and into every organelle outside the mitochondria.\n\nWhile it is more important in cells with high ATP requirements, variable ATP requirements, and long distances between mitochondria and the source of ATP utilization, it is still incredibly important in every cell.\n\nThere is no point in optimizing your mitochondria if you don’t also optimize your creatine.\n\nMany people may believe that the high muscle creatine stores that athletes achieve with creatine supplements are “unnatural” and something not achievable until creatine supplements were available.\n\nHere, I argue that nothing could be further from the truth. Every muscle fiber wants to be exactly as rich in creatine as achieved with creatine supplementation.\n\nAll of your cells want to be rich in creatine. Your brain is dying to be this rich in creatine. Your muscles are starving to be this rich in creatine.\n\nIt is completely natural to be this rich in creatine, yet most of us in the modern era who don’t supplement just aren’t that optimized.\n\nThe creatine we require to be optimized is likely etched deep into our beings by our ancestral consumption of one to two pounds of meat per day. When red and rare, one pound can give the dose that saturates tissue stores. When white and well done, two pounds may be required.\n\nBut can we synthesize enough creatine ourselves when all the precursors in place?\n\nHere we examine that question.\n\nBut first, a brief review of creatine’s lesser known benefits.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nCreatine is by far the most well-studied, well-supported nutritional supplement for athletic performance.\n\nIt’s about a lot more than that, though. 90-95% is found in skeletal muscle, but here is what the rest of it is doing:\n\nIn sperm, creatine provides the power used to flip the tail and swim up the vaginal canal.

In the intestines, creatine provides the power needed to absorb nutrients. Our intestines have large finger-like projections known as villi that provide the enormous surface area needed for nutrient absorption, and the cells at the tips of the villi need to be replaced every few days. Creatine provides the large amount of energy needed to replace these cells on such a quick schedule. All of this suggests that creatine is very important to digestion and gastrointestinal health.\n\nIn our stomach, creatine provides the power to pump the stomach acid needed to digest our food.

This huge energy demand is largely provided by creatine.\n\nI have covered and referenced this material before:\n\nConsuming Creatine in Foods and Supplements\n\nConsuming Creatine in Foods and Supplements\n\nCreatine: Far More Than a Performance Enhancer\n\nCreatine: Far More Than a Performance Enhancer\n\nThree to five grams per day over four weeks or longer is sufficient to saturate muscle stores and is well studied and widely used in the context of athletic performance.\n\nThis dose has also been shown to improve symptoms of major depression in women.\n\nRecently, a single dose of 20 grams was shown to improve cognitive function during sleep deprivation.\n\nOther research has shown 20 grams of creatine for seven days to improve cognitive function in older adults or in young individuals subjected to hypoxia. 20 grams of creatine per day for six months in traumatic brain injury patients reduced amnesia and improved a large number of metrics of recovery.\n\nCreatine is the most well studied supplement in existence, and the most popularly used among athletes, and has nearly nothing documented in the literature as predictable adverse effects.\n\nHowever, anecdotally, people have reported elevated creatinine, insomnia, cramps, bloating, constipation, water retention, hair loss, irritation, anger, anxiety, lightheadedness during lifting, aggravation of restless leg syndrome, irritation of asthma, bloody noses, headaches, heart palpitations, and changes in heart rate.\n\nThese are likely a result of imbalances with electrolytes and amino acids that have simple solutions, and are covered in Handling Creatine Side Effects.\n\nMany people seem to believe that the increase in muscular creatine stores achieved with supplementation is unnatural.\n\nThis is contradicted by the earliest studies on the matter.\n\nIn an early 1974 study, Harris and colleagues measured muscle creatine stores of 81 athletically untrained subjects between the ages of 18-30, sex not mentioned, and found an average of 124.4 millimoles per kilogram of dry matter. The range was not clearly described, but the standard deviation was 11.2. In a typical bell curve distribution, this implies 95% of people have muscular creatine content between 102 and 146.8.\n\nIn a groundbreaking 1992 study, the same group studied increases in muscular creatine after different dosing regimens of creatine supplementation at rest and with exercise.\n\nThe most salient point from this study was that when the individual changes in each subject were plotted against baseline muscle creatine content, the effect of every regimen was simply to bring everyone, as the authors described in the abstract “closer to the upper limit of the normal range.”\n\nThe vertical bars are big, indicating big increases, when the person had baseline creatine content below 120. If their baseline creatine content was in the 140s, they hardly moved at all. Everyone converged on the 140-160 range.\n\nAll of Harris’s dosing regimens were permutations of 20 grams a day in multiple doses for different durations, or in some cases alternating days.\n\nIn a subsequent classic 1996 study by another group, “Creatine Loading in Men,” Hultman and colleagues showed that creatine stores top out in the 140-160 range whether one does a 20-gram loading phase or takes the slow and steady approach of 3 grams per day.\n\nThe error bars are standard errors, not standard deviations, so they visually underestimate the range, and the ranges were not reported. However, focusing on the means, the most salient point is that every regimen peaks at a little over 140.\n\nThe top graph shows 20 grams of creatine for six days followed by withdrawal of creatine. The bottom graph shows the same loading dose followed by a two gram per day maintenance dose.\n\nA third group took 3 grams a day for the entire period and experienced the same rise in creatine stores, shown in the last column of this table:\n\nNote that, throughout the studies, there is a slow path and a rapid path to get to a muscular creatine content in the 140-160 range, and that’s it.\n\nThe capping out is thought to be from the downregulation of creatine transporters in muscle after they reach the saturation point.\n\nYet that makes it clear that they want to reach that point. They could have downregulated the transporters when they had reached average creatine status, but they didn’t.\n\nIt seems evident from this that muscles want to be in the 140-160 range, and that some people get close without dietary creatine and others require a supplement.\n\nMuscle doesn’t try to be in the 100s or the 120s. It doesn’t try to be in the 200s. As long as the supply is sufficient, muscle converges on a creatine content in the 140-160 range. The variation is larger at baseline, and it shrinks as muscle converges on the creatine stores it wants.\n\nThe average person synthesizes 0.97 grams of creatine per day and eats 1-2 grams per day. Supplementing 21 grams per day drops the rate of synthesis by 30% to 0.68 grams per day. The fact that 2-3 grams of supplemental creatine per day over the long-term can saturate muscle stores suggests that the total requirement between food, synthesis, and supplements to saturate muscle stores is 4-6 grams.\n\nThe actual creatine demand will be a function of lean body mass, but does not vary by sex after accounting for women having less lean body mass than men.\n\nWhile brain creatine does not always change to the same proportion as muscle creatine upon supplementation, they change in the same direction, so the conditions that lead to muscle saturation of creatine stores are likely leading to the optimization of whole-body creatine status and provide an index of how much we need for whole-body creatine optimization.\n\nSo, if we need this much why don’t we synthesize this much?\n\nCreatine is synthesized in two steps. First, arginine is bound to glycine to produce guanidinoacetate. Second, guanidinoacetate is methylated to produce creatine.\n\nThe first reaction is catalyzed by arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT).\n\nThe second is catalyzed by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT).\n\nReviews commonly describe creatine synthesis as an interorgan process where the kidneys produce the bulk of the guanidinoacetate, the liver converts guanidinoacetate to creatine, and 90-95% of the creatine is taken up by muscles.\n\nHowever, this is likely an oversimplification. For example, a 2021 paper pointed out that this “traditional dogma of creatine metabolism” was contradicted by several papers produced over 40 years suggesting skeletal muscle can synthesize a considerable portion of its own creatine.\n\nAGAT is expressed in not only the kidney, but also the pancreas, liver, heart, brain, and testes.\n\nA 2007 paper found that in rats the kidney synthesizes almost all the guanidinoacetate, but in humans the kidney only makes 11-12% of it.\n\nNevertheless, the liver is the most important site of methylation so is likely the disproportionate producer of the body’s creatine.\n\nThe AGAT enzyme is thought to be “regulated tightly,” with thyroid hormone and growth hormone increasing it, and creatine inhibiting it in a negative feedback loop.\n\nIf the negative feedback from creatine is strong, then one could argue that the average creatine status in the population is the way it is because we make just the amount of creatine we need.\n\nThat would indicate that saturating muscle stores with creatine supplements is more than we need, yet it would make it seem bizarre that muscles keep their creatine transporters up at full volume until they reach that higher point.\n\nThe reality is that these enzymes are not tightly regulated. We see this in the above-cited paper where 21 grams of creatine per day decreases the rate of synthesis by only 30%. That’s the loss of a third of a gram of synthesized creatine for every 21 grams being sucked up into tissue from supplements. That’s loose regulation.\n\nGranted, it might only be so loose because most of us are so far away from optimal creatine status. But it is clear that the reason our creatine status is lower than we would get from supplementation is not because our body is trying to keep it that way.\n\nSo, then, what is stopping us from making more creatine?\n\n45% of methylation is used for creatine synthesis, 45% is used for phosphatidylcholine synthesis, and the remaining 10% is used on dozens of processes, some prominent ones being the regulation of gene expression, the intracellular degradation of histamine, and the regulation of dopamine and other neurotransmitters.\n\nIt is rather clear from this alone that, in the average person, methyl supply has to limit creatine synthesis. If we 2.2x’d our creatine synthesis while holding methyl supply constant, we would not have any methyl groups left for anything else.\n\nAnd we would still only reach 2 grams of creatine synthesized when we need a total of 4-6 grams.\n\nHowever, methylation being limiting is contradicted by a human trial where 2 grams of betaine (trimethylglycine or TMG) taken for ten days had no effect on creatine stores.\n\nThe rate of methylation is estimated to be 16.7–23.4 millimoles per day in young people weighing 70 kilograms, and 15.5–21.7 millimoles per day in older adults weighing 70 kilograms. If we take the upper end, this will provide a conservative estimate of whether the TMG should have been expected to increase creatine synthesis if methyl groups were limiting.\n\n2 grams of betaine is 17 millimoles. Each molecule has three methyl groups, so this is 51 millimoles of methyl groups, 2.2 times the upper estimate of the average daily methyl flux, and 4.8 times the flux devoted to creatine synthesis.\n\nThe extra methyl groups were plenty.\n\nThus, it has to be the case that average methyl supply imposes a strict limitation on creatine synthesis, yet it is clear from the betaine trial that something else is even more limiting.\n\nIn my 2017 podcast, Living With MTHFR, I followed Reed’s 2015 paper, Mathematical Analysis of the Regulation of Competing Methyltransferases to argue that creatine synthesis is very sensitive to methyl supply, while other functions such as DNA methylation are not.\n\nThis was supported by modeling the different enzymes having different binding affinities for methyl groups, such that processes we want to be independent of methyl supply like DNA methylation bind very tightly, and processes that we want to sacrifice when methyl supply is low like creatine synthesis bind more loosely. This modeling suggested that in the fasting state most methylation reactions run normally, but creatine synthesis declines. In the fed state, the influx of methionine allows creatine synthesis to catch up, and any extra methyl groups are mopped up by glycine.\n\nThe rationale for this is simple. We don’t want genes to necessarily be regulated by the fasting-feeding cycle when they need to be regulated by many other things, we don’t want to be sneezing between meals from undermethylation of histamine, and we don’t want to become pathological ruminators in the fasting state from undermethylation of dopamine.\n\nBy contrast, creatine synthesis can take the hit for a few hours. The average person has 120 grams of creatine in their body, with 1-2% of it degrading to creatinine and leaving in the urine each day. If we assume that we have enough creatine, all that has to happen to stay alive and reasonably healthy is to have the credits and debits in the creatine account balance out at the end of the month. We just need to make sure that over the long-haul we still have on average 120 grams of creatine in our body on any given day.\n\nWhile this makes a lot of sense, there are multiple studies that contradict this prioritization:\n\nIn 1971, Keshavarz and Fuller showed in male broiler chicks in their first two weeks of life that extra arginine increased muscle creatine stores, but extra glycine and methionine did not. However, extra arginine decreased growth and increased loss of creatine in the urine. These negative effects were alleviated by supplying extra methyl donors in several ways: methionine, choline, betaine, or the combination of B12 and folic acid. This suggested that the supply of arginine was the main driver of creatine synthesis, but that if methyl group supply was insufficient to handle the arginine load, methyl depletion would occur, causing much of the creatine to be wasted by going into the urine and, more importantly, hurting the growth of the chicks. In this study, young chicks sacrificed their growth to increase their creatine stores.\n\nIn 1971, Keshavarz and Fuller showed in male broiler chicks in their first two weeks of life that extra arginine increased muscle creatine stores, but extra glycine and methionine did not.

In this study, young chicks sacrificed their growth to increase their creatine stores.\n\nIn 1986, experiments with human breast cancer cells showed that when methionine supply was low, the cells sacrificed their ability to methylate histones in the regulation of gene expression just so they could keep synthesizing creatine. When they were deprived of arginine and glycine, histone methylation was restored. While this could represent an abnormality of breast cancer cells, synthesizing creatine took priority over regulating gene expression.\n\nIn 1986, experiments with human breast cancer cells showed that when methionine supply was low, the cells sacrificed their ability to methylate histones in the regulation of gene expression just so they could keep synthesizing creatine.

While this could represent an abnormality of breast cancer cells, synthesizing creatine took priority over regulating gene expression.\n\nIn 2015 it was shown in 14-16-week-old Yucutan miniature pigs that guanidinoacetate supplementation increased muscle creatine stores but decreased the synthesis of choline, the methylation of proteins, and the liver’s concentration of S-adenosyl-methionine.

This indicates that creatine synthesis took priority over everything else.\n\nHowever, in 2016 a study found that in miniature pigs that were 4-9 days old, phosphatidylcholine synthesis took priority over creatine synthesis. This suggests phosphatidylcholine synthesis may take priority over creatine synthesis in certain contexts. My guess is that this only applies when cholinergic nervous system development is prominent, which is very limited in most animals but in humans extends into the fourth year of life.\n\nHowever, in 2016 a study found that in miniature pigs that were 4-9 days old, phosphatidylcholine synthesis took priority over creatine synthesis. This suggests phosphatidylcholine synthesis may take priority over creatine synthesis in certain contexts. My guess is that this only applies when cholinergic nervous system development is prominent, which is very limited in most animals but in humans extends into the fourth year of life.\n\nThe first three studies above all suggest that arginine supply is the main driver of creatine synthesis. However, if cells under certain conditions prioritize the conservation of methyl groups, then extra methyl groups would be required to match creatine synthesis to the arginine supply.\n\nThis seems to be the case in newborn miniature pigs, and again my suspicion is that this is because the demand for phosphatidylcholine is high in the neonatal period because cholinergic neurons may still be developing.\n\nA 2021 study in miniature pigs 9-11 days old showed that doubling the supply of arginine and methionine above normal requirements increased kidney creatine 2.5-fold and liver creatine more than 5-fold, while seeming to slightly increase brain creatine and have no impact on muscle creatine. Supplementing creatine or guanidinoacetate plus methionine had a similar impact, while guanidinoacetate without methionine had no effect. In this case, arginine or guanidinoacetate drove creatine synthesis only when extra methyl groups were available.\n\nA 2007 study in rats found that in rats fed the standard AIN-93G diet, thought to be optimized for the nutritional requirements of the rat, infusion of glycine did nothing to increase guanidinoacetate synthesis, while infusion of arginine increased it 150% and infusion of citriulline, which generates arginine in the kidney, nearly doubled it.\n\nNotably, the above studies show that regulation of the enzymes follows the increase of creatine status to the saturated state we associate with supplementation.\n\nIn humans, 21 grams of creatine per day for five days, which is known to saturate creatine stores, causes a 30% decrease in creatine synthesis, which is not remotely sufficient to stop creatine stores from saturating.\n\nIn humans, 21 grams of creatine per day for five days, which is known to saturate creatine stores, causes a 30% decrease in creatine synthesis, which is not remotely sufficient to stop creatine stores from saturating.\n\nIn miniature pigs, doubling arginine and methionine over “adequate” intakes doubled guanidinoacetate production while cutting AGAT activity in half. AGAT activity went down because the supply of the substrates was sufficient to double its product despite the lower activity of the enzyme.\n\nIn miniature pigs, doubling arginine and methionine over “adequate” intakes doubled guanidinoacetate production while cutting AGAT activity in half. AGAT activity went down because the supply of the substrates was sufficient to double its product despite the lower activity of the enzyme.\n\nIn rats, 4 grams per kilogram bodyweight creatine per day for two weeks decreased AGAT activity by 86%, but this is like a human taking 280 grams of creatine a day adjusting for bodyweight alone or taking 1,680 grams a day after adjusting for surface area. So this was orders of magnitude more than needed for saturation and after two weeks AGAT was still operating with residual activity.\n\nIn rats, 4 grams per kilogram bodyweight creatine per day for two weeks decreased AGAT activity by 86%, but this is like a human taking 280 grams of creatine a day adjusting for bodyweight alone or taking 1,680 grams a day after adjusting for surface area. So this was orders of magnitude more than needed for saturation and after two weeks AGAT was still operating with residual activity.\n\nClearly what limits creatine synthesis most is the supply of arginine.\n\nAnd if we supply enough arginine, the methyl groups must become limiting because the normal flux of methyl groups is not sufficient for optimal creatine synthesis even if it were used for nothing else.\n\nUnder certain conditions, glycine could probably become limiting, but glycine was never limiting in the studies reviewed above.\n\nIf 5 grams is the amount of creatine we need to synthesize to hit our optimal concentration with synthesis alone, due to their different weights, this would require 6.6 grams of arginine.\n\nThe average adult in the US consumes about five grams of arginine per day. About 1.3 grams is used for creatine synthesis, leaving 3.7 to be used for other purposes. An additional 5.3 grams of arginine would be needed to meet the need for creatine through synthesis alone, bringing the average intake up to 10.3 grams.\n\nMethyl supply would then become limiting. Two grams of TMG supplies 4.8 times the methyl groups devoted to synthesizing one gram of creatine per day, so adding this on top of usual methyl donor intake would bring the total methyl supply sufficient to synthesize the 5 total grams of creatine.\n\nCalculating the supply of methyl groups needed from the folate/B12 pathway becomes very complicated, because the methyl group comes primarily from glucose, which is used to synthesize serine, which then donates a carbon to folate during the synthesis of glycine. Alternatively, in the presence of TMG, one of the three methyl groups passes through the betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) enzyme, while the other two are funneled through folate and B12 as an alternative to the use of glucose.\n\nSupplementing with methylfolate to get the methyl group that comes preformed in the supplement is a joke. Methylfolate is much bigger than TMG, and therefore weighs more, and it only has one methyl group instead of three. It would take 20 grams to get sufficient methyl supply for creatine synthesis, and that is not safe.\n\nNevertheless, you need sufficient folate and B12 to use the methyl groups of TMG. See my Custom Nutrient Targets for those two vitamins.\n\nTo get the methyl groups from methionine would require 5.2 grams of methionine above and beyond the 2.1 grams of methionine typically consumed in the US.\n\nSome amount of TMG could be replaced by choline as well, but the base choline requirement is already 450-900 milligrams per day.\n\nMy Choline Database gives food sources of choline and TMG. Getting 2 grams of the sum of choline and betaine over the basic requirement would require eating a lot of quinoa, eggs, liver, and/or wheat germ.\n\nIt is possible but very difficult to hit these targets on a vegan diet. You could get 2.5 grams of choline plus TMG from 500 grams of quinoa, and that would give you 5.5 grams of arginine. Add 500 grams of tofu, and you hit 10.2 grams of arginine. You’re already at 2358 Calories, so you probably don’t have that much room for very high nutrient-density, low-calorie vegetables to round out micronutrient intakes, and you’d need some supplements, especially B12.\n\nOn a vegetarian diet with eggs and dairy, you could take advantage of higher methionine levels, but you’d need to eat even more total protein to get enough arginine.\n\nMeat and fish are by far and away the easiest ways to support creatine status with whole foods. As covered in my database, Consuming Creatine in Foods and Supplements, the rule of thumb is that “red and rare” requires one pound per day, while “white and well done” requires two pounds per day.\n\nThat gets you the preformed creatine that supports optimal status and it provides higher levels of arginine and methionine. Eggs, liver, legumes, dark greens, and collagenous tissues on the side provide plenty of choline, folate, and glycine to assist in the synthesis of additional creatine. Since the creatine is consumed pre-formed in the meat, the other nutrients are simply available in excess to provide an extra window of safety.\n\nWhile there are vegan ways to hack increasing creatine synthesis, these have not been shown in human trials to work, and they require planning your entire diet around trying to support creatine synthesis. It is far easier to just take a supplement.\n\nOur cells are starving for creatine and are not satiated until they reach the creatine status reached by most people only through supplementation.\n\nThey do not keep themselves at “normal” creatine status through regulation. Creatine synthesis is limited first by the supply of arginine, and once arginine is supplied it is limited by methyl group supply. In some people with low glycine status, it may also be limited by glycine.\n\nThere is nothing “natural” about having average unsupplemented creatine status. Your body hates it.\n\nAchieving optimal creatine status without supplements requires one pound of “rare and red” meat or fish per day, which can include salmon, or two pounds of “white and well done” meat or fish per day.\n\nVegans, people who require low-arginine diets to manage herpes outbreaks, people who have impairments in the urea cycle or specific pathways of amino acid metabolism, people who feel better on lower-meat diets, or people who for whatever reason do not want to eat 1-2 pounds of meat per day should supplement with 3-5 grams per day of Creapure creatine monohydrate.\n\nDespite the necessity for everyone of maximizing their creatine stores, some people report elevated creatinine, insomnia, cramps, bloating, constipation, water retention, hair loss, irritation, anger, anxiety, lightheadedness during lifting, aggravation of restless leg syndrome, irritation of asthma, bloody noses, headaches, heart palpitations, and changes in heart rate.\n\nThese are addressed in this article:\n\nClick Here to Read “Handling Creatine Side Effects”\n\nLet me know in the comments!\n\nSubtitle: If you're not eating this type of diet you need a supplement.\n\nDescription: If you're not eating this type of diet you need a supplement.",

    "title": "Is Hydrogen Sulfide the New Estrogen?",
    "content": "We know sulfite, which derives from hydrogen sulfide, tanks testosterone in males. Could hydrogen sulfide also feminize men through estrogenic effects?\n\nCould it explain “estrogen dominance” in women when estrogen levels in the blood, saliva, or urine simply don’t support that interpretation?\n\nIf so, this is revolutionary to our understanding.\n\nLet’s look at some hints it may be true.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nEstrogen increases hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production.\n\nHydrogen sulfide is a gas with many signaling roles like nitric oxide, and among those many roles they are both vasodilators. They are both absolutely essential to our physiology.\n\nAt much higher doses, hydrogen sulfide is a lethal toxin that inhibits complex IV of the respiratory chain and releases iron from ferritin, causing secondary toxicity from free iron.\n\nIt increases dramatically in pregnancy because it is an important regulator of placental function. Among its effects, it relaxes the placental vasculature, which removes restrictions on fetal growth and improves the health of the baby later in life.\n\nTwo reviews cover data suggesting it is responsible for the nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, as well as in extreme cases hallucinations and other elements of psychosis due to its conversion to sulfite, which destroys thiamin, B6, folate, and possibly other B vitamins.\n\nGestational malnutrition, hyperemesis gravidarum, and Wernicke's encephalopathy: What is missing?\n\nA novel treatment for \"morning sickness\": Nausea of pregnancy could be induced by excess sulfite which molybdenum can help alleviate.\n\nIt follows from this that any such issues that correlate with the estrogen peaks of the menstrual cycle are also likely due to hydrogen sulfide. For example, vasodilation can cause headaches and B vitamin depletion can disrupt mood.\n\nWhy does estrogen increase hydrogen sulfide?\n\nFor years I chalked this up to it playing an important role in placental function.\n\nSure, pregnancy is the naturally occurring period of exposure to consistently high estrogen levels. But why on earth would all of its associated vasodilation and potential toxicity risk be bound up with the normal ebb and flow of the menstrual cycle?\n\nIt occurred to me that hydrogen sulfide may be estrogen’s little assistant, doing much of its bidding.\n\nSo I looked for evidence that hydrogen sulfide can by itself cause breasts to develop.\n\nLo and behold, injection of hydrogen sulfide into prepubescent female mice causes them to develop breasts!\n\nPublished in 2020, this paper has only been cited three times according to Google Scholar. Not that it’s an amazing paper that should have been published in Nature. No, it’s just an ok paper. But the implications of this are simply stunning, so it is crazy that it has gotten so little attention.\n\nLow concentrations of hydrogen sulfide caused breast development, while high concentrations inhibited breast development.\n\nLow concentrations increased estrogen levels, and high concentrations decreased estrogen levels.\n\nHowever, that does not mean the breast development was caused exclusively by the estrogen spike. When mammary cells were incubated with hydrogen sulfide in vitro, it increased their viability and promoted signaling cascades associated with growth. No estrogen involved.\n\nNow, many questions arise.\n\nIs this a non-specific growth-promoting effect?\n\nDoes hydrogen sulfide make everyone older and thus make prepubescent mice pubescent?\n\nOr does hydrogen sulfide just align itself with estrogen, stimulating estrogen in a positive feedback loop and helping do the things that estrogen likes to have done?\n\nHydrogen sulfide promotes proliferation in oral cancer cells, but then again, so does estrogen. Hydrogen sulfide promotes cell viability in the brain, which does not seem like a pro-aging effect, but it is an estrogenic effect. Hydrogen sulfide stimulates GLP-1, making it nature’s Ozempic, and estrogen synergizes with GLP-1 to enhance its suppression of food and water intake.\n\nHydrogen sulfide’s growth-promoting effects might, then, be related to the role of estrogen in causing endometrial hyperplasia, which is opposed by progesterone and is likely a major driver of menstrual cramps.\n\nEstrogen and hydrogen sulfide both play essential roles in both men and women.\n\nBut could hydrogen sulfide independently mimic estrogen in some ways, leading to undesirable feminization in men or the many problems associated with excess or imbalanced estrogen in women?\n\nIt is too early to say, but this certainly deserves research!\n\nClick here to get my Sulfur Protocol:\n\nGet the Sulfur Protocol\n\nIf you missed it, check out my other writings about sulfur:\n\nMaybe THIS Is Why You’re Hangry\n\nMaybe THIS Is Why You’re Hangry\n\nIs THIS Behind Your Muscle Tension?\n\nIs THIS Behind Your Muscle Tension?\n\nWill Longevity Diets Wreck Your Hormones?\n\nWill Longevity Diets Wreck Your Hormones?\n\nHow Many Calories Does Sulfur Have?\nCoQ10 Deficiency Is Sulfur Toxicity\n\nHow Many Calories Does Sulfur Have?\nCoQ10 Deficiency Is Sulfur Toxicity\n\nThe Unknown Testosterone Nutrient\n\nThe Unknown Testosterone Nutrient\n\nVitamins and Minerals 101: Molybdenum\n\nVitamins and Minerals 101: Molybdenum\n\nMissing From the Databases: Molybdenum\n\nMissing From the Databases: Molybdenum\n\nA Simple DIY Home Test for Molybdenum Deficiency\n\nA Simple DIY Home Test for Molybdenum Deficiency\n\nSubtitle: A little-known study from 2020 suggests it may be.\n\nDescription: A little-known study from 2020 suggests it may be.",

    "title": "Alternate Day Iron Dosing: Does It Work?",
    "content": "After releasing my Iron Deficiency Protocol, several people asked me about alternate-day dosing.\n\nHere’s the hypothesis: when you take iron, it spikes the hormone hepcidin; hepcidin shuts down iron absorption; therefore, if you wait till hepcidin goes back down, the next dose will have higher bioavailability. Higher bioavailability over time leads to better cumulative iron absorption.\n\nMy critique: as covered in Understanding Iron, the reason hepcidin responds to iron status is to ensure optimal iron status with as little influence of your diet as possible; if iron status goes up over a few weeks, all this does is generate even more hepcidin; therefore, all things related to properly functioning hepcidin should mean revert over time, meaning they just go back to the way they were.\n\nThis is educational in nature and not medical or dietetic advice. See terms for additional and more complete disclaimers.\n\nSince we know that iron status going up makes the absorption of iron from food and supplements go down, to show something novel and practical these studies have to show that you can get the total amount of iron absorbed per unit time higher by introducing a complication into the dosing schedule.\n\nIn other words, it is obvious that if you allow for a longer time, you can get more iron absorbed, and it is obvious that if you consume less iron, you will absorb more from food and supplements. What is not so obvious is whether taking iron every other day instead of taking it every day can give you greater total iron absorption over the course of a particular unit of time, such as a month, or six months.\n\nThe first of these studies was Stoffel, 2017. The dosing schedule was 60 milligrams of iron from ferrous sulfate either every day for 14 days, or every other day for 28 days.\n\nThe fractional iron absorption increased from 16.3% to 21.8% on the alternate day dosing, a relative increase of 33.7%. The total iron absorption increased from 131 milligrams to 175.3 milligrams, a relative increase of 33.8%.\n\nHowever, the alternate dosing group was given twice the amount of time to absorb the iron!\n\nThat means the absorption of iron per unit time FELL from 65.5 milligrams per week to 43.8 milligrams per week, a relative LOSS of 33%.\n\nThe study presents the data in a way that makes the regimen look 34% better when it is actually 33% worse.\n\nOflas, 2020 then compared 160 milligrams per day to 80 milligrams per day to 80 milligrams every other day for one month. Hemoglobin rose similarly in all three groups, ferritin rose the most in the first group, and side effects were highest in the first group and lowest in the third group. They didn’t measure iron absorption. All this shows is that 40 milligrams per day is plenty and 160 milligrams per day is too much.\n\nMehta, 2020 then compared 60 milligrams every day to 60 milligrams every other day for 21 days. Nausea and metallic taste drove higher total side effects in the every day group, while hemoglobin increased more in the alternate day group. This implies that 30 milligrams per day works better than 60 milligrams per day. This contrasts with Oflas, 2020, where the hemoglobin rise was similar across groups, although Oflas made 40 milligrams per day look sufficient, which is close to 30 milligrams per day. This study did not look at total iron absorbed. Hemoglobin was the only variable they reported at 21 days, which makes them look like they were cherry-picking their data.\n\nA meta-analysis published this year ranked this study as the one out of five randomized trials that had a high risk of bias, due to unclear description of the randomization process, deviation from the original protocol, and selective reporting of results.\n\nKaundal, 2020 compared 60 milligrams twice a day for three weeks to 120 milligrams taken every other day for six weeks. They received the same total amount of iron, but as with Stoffel, 2017, the alternate-day group was given twice as much time to absorb the iron. Despite this, the hemoglobin response was better in the twice a day group, and side effects were greater too. This study did not measure iron absorption.\n\nStoffel, 2020 looked at alternate versus daily dosing of an iron-fortified porridge and alternate versus every-third-day dosing of an iron supplement in Kenyan babies, with 12 milligrams of iron in each dose, focusing on changes occurring within four days of the regimen. There was no difference in fractional iron absorption after the second porridge meal between the consecutive and alternate-day regimens, nor after the second dose of the two supplement regimens. This obviously suggests that daily dosing would provide more absorbed iron than alternate or every-third-day dosing.\n\nKaynar, 2022 compared 160 milligrams every day to 160 milligrams every other day over the course of 60 days. At the end of the study, the values for hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and everything else were practically identical. They did not report iron absorption or side effects. This suggests 80 milligrams of iron per day is plenty and that 160 milligrams per day is a waste, which is consistent with Oflas, 2020’s suggestion that 40 milligrams per day is plenty.\n\nPasupathy, 2023 compared 120 milligrams every other day to 60 milligrams per day for two months. They placebo-controlled the treatment by having everyone take two tablets per day and spacing the placebo and iron tablets differently in the two groups. This is the first of these studies to equate both the total dose of iron taken and the total time over which it was taken.\n\nThe rise in hemoglobin was not statistically different between groups, though it appears slightly better in the daily group and the gap widens over time, suggesting the daily group might prove superior if given months instead of weeks:\n\nAt week 4, there was five times as much nausea in the alternate day group than in the daily group, but by week 8 this evened out and there were no other differences between groups in adverse effects.\n\nStoffel, 2023 then really pushed the boundaries of an absolutely bizarre study design. One group got 100 milligrams of iron every day for 90 days and then a placebo for 90 days. The other group got 100 milligrams of iron one day alternated with a placebo the next day, repeating for 180 days. At the 93-day mark, hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were all higher in the daily group. At the 186-day mark, hemoglobin levels were identical between the two groups. Hematocrit was identical. Transferrin saturation and ferritin were better in the alternate-day group. Side effects were higher in the daily group than in the alternate-day group throughout the study.\n\nNow, at this point Stoffel finally joined the ranks of Pasupathy in equating for both cumulative iron intake and time. However, that span of time involved 3 months straight of taking a placebo for one group. This, then, completely left the realm of any practical utility. Who on earth would adopt a regimen of alternating quarterly between supplementing and not supplementing iron daily?\n\nA systematic review published this May, covering everything except Stoffel, 2023, concluded that alternate-dosing has no impact on hemoglobin or iron markers but reduces the risk of side effects.\n\nBut every single one of these studies used ferrous sulfate, famous for its gastrointestinal side effects!\n\nThere are other ways to avoid these side effects. Focus on food, or on a different type of iron supplement.\n\nFurther, none of these studies support doses higher than 40 milligrams per day doing anything better than 30-40 milligrams per day, and those that do compare dosing almost universally show that 30-40 milligrams per day greatly reduces side effects compared to higher doses.\n\nThe only two studies that controlled for the total amount of iron given per unit time were Pasupathy, 2023 and Stoffel, 2023:\n\nStoffel, 2023 simply showed that taking iron every day can normalize hemoglobin 3 months faster than taking it every other day, and that if you go three months without taking any iron after three months of taking 100 milligrams per day your iron markers will drop.\n\nStoffel, 2023 simply showed that taking iron every day can normalize hemoglobin 3 months faster than taking it every other day, and that if you go three months without taking any iron after three months of taking 100 milligrams per day your iron markers will drop.\n\nPasupathy, 2023 is the only study to control for total iron per unit time and to do so in a realistic regimen: take half as much every day perpetually, or take twice as much every other day perpetually. It suggested that overall there is no difference in anything when using an average dose of 60 milligrams per day, but it hinted that over a period much longer than 8 weeks, the daily dose might prove superior in raising hemoglobin.\n\nPasupathy, 2023 is the only study to control for total iron per unit time and to do so in a realistic regimen: take half as much every day perpetually, or take twice as much every other day perpetually.

However, when they limited the analysis to women under 40, the ones with hair loss had 76% lower ferritin and 13% lower hemoglobin.\n\nIn 106 women with telogen effluvium (diffuse hair loss 2-3 months after premature shifting of the hair from the growth phase to the resting phase in response to some trigger), there was no difference in iron status with controls. However, when they limited the analysis to women under 40, the ones with hair loss had 76% lower ferritin and 13% lower hemoglobin.\n\nA small (n=12) double-blind, placebo-controlled study in women with telogen effluvium found 72 mg iron and 1.5 g lysine per day led to 31% reduction in hair shedding vs 9% increase in placebo. The same protocol in 22 women reduced the percentage of hair in the telogen (resting) phase.\n\nA small (n=12) double-blind, placebo-controlled study in women with telogen effluvium found 72 mg iron and 1.5 g lysine per day led to 31% reduction in hair shedding vs 9% increase in placebo. The same protocol in 22 women reduced the percentage of hair in the telogen (resting) phase.\n\nIn a 1963 study, in 18 female patients with diffuse hair loss, no skin disease, and iron deficiency, 37-40 mg elemental iron 1 to 2 tablets 3 times daily caused hair loss to cease.\n\nIn a 1963 study, in 18 female patients with diffuse hair loss, no skin disease, and iron deficiency, 37-40 mg elemental iron 1 to 2 tablets 3 times daily caused hair loss to cease.\n\nAnother study, not reviewed in the previous reference, found that 97 men with male pattern baldness had 47% lower ferritin than 97 healthy controls (similar results in women), though other markers were not different and none had diagnosable iron deficiency.\n\nAnother study, not reviewed in the previous reference, found that 97 men with male pattern baldness had 47% lower ferritin than 97 healthy controls (similar results in women), though other markers were not different and none had diagnosable iron deficiency.\n\nTaking the two randomized controlled trials, while small and both in women, the distinction between a 31% reduction in hair shedding and a complete abolition of hair shedding likely results from the fact that the latter study was in women who were clinically iron deficient.\n\nThus, if you know you qualify as deficient it’s a much surer bet that fixing the deficiency will get rid of the hair loss.\n\nBut if suboptimal iron status is a major but incomplete part of the suboptimal energy metabolism in your hair follicle, getting your iron levels up is likely to provide very large but incomplete benefits.\n\nNow, we know that no one really knows what ferritin is doing in serum or how to interpret it, but as I pointed out in Understanding Iron, serum ferritin will often, but not always, capture a state of iron deficiency.\n\nBut with a couple of small randomized trials and some animal experiments covered below, optimizing iron status seems like a very promising way to help with hair loss.\n\nSome potential mechanisms mentioned in human studies include these:\n\nIron is a cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase, which is rate-limiting for DNA synthesis and thus needed for cellular proliferation, and hair follicle cells have high differentiation rate so will depend on this enzyme.\n\nIron is a cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase, which is rate-limiting for DNA synthesis and thus needed for cellular proliferation, and hair follicle cells have high differentiation rate so will depend on this enzyme.\n\nStearyl CoA desaturase is an iron-dependent enzyme needed for oleic acid production, and loss of this enzyme causes hair loss in mice.\n\nStearyl CoA desaturase is an iron-dependent enzyme needed for oleic acid production, and loss of this enzyme causes hair loss in mice.\n\nOne study found that in human keritinocytes, iron deficiency impaired keratin expression while cysteine abolished this effect. Keratin is an important component of hair. It appears that cysteine upregulated ferritin, which helped retain iron in the cell that would have otherwise been depleted by the chelator they were using to induce iron deficiency. However, as I covered in Understanding Iron, hydrogen sulfide releases iron from ferritin. Cysteine is the main source of hydrogen sulfide. So it is also possible cysteine would support the dynamic release of iron from ferritin, making it available for use in iron-dependent enzymes.\n\nThis study found that topical application of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA, a precursor to heme, which contains iron), was slightly better at stimulating hair growth in mice than iron alone, but that topical application of both together was much better and was as effective as minoxidil, which is used for androgenic alopecia.\n\nMinoxidil is thought to work by increasing blood supply to the follicle. This mouse study suggests the effect of iron is mediated by heme synthesis.\n\nThere was no change in cellular proliferation in this study, suggesting that the effect of iron is not only heme-dependent but is independent of ribonucleotide reductase-dependent DNA synthesis.\n\nWhen taken in the context of the comparison to minoxidil, the most surface-level obvious explanation is that minoxidil works by increasing the volume of blood delivered, while iron plus 5-ALA works by increasing the amount of hemoglobin in the blood, both of which would increase oxygen delivery to the follicle.\n\nNotably, however, heme has many functions outside of hemoglobin, including the antioxidant enzyme catalase, and parts of the electron transport chain needed to make ATP.\n\nFurther, the systemic delivery of oxygen would be improved by increased heme synthesis in red blood cell precursors of the bone marrow, so topical application is probably increasing heme synthesis in the follicle itself, and that is probably working through improved mitochondrial energy metabolism.\n\nAfter all, if delivering oxygen to the hair follicle works, then you can bet the farm that improving energy metabolism in the hair follicle by any other means will work, because the whole point of delivering oxygen to the hair follicle is to use in in the mitochondrial respiratory chain to make ATP.\n\nIron is also a cofactor for thyroid peroxidase, and is every single bit as essential to thyroid hormone production as iodine is. Hypothyroidism is famous for causing hair loss.\n\nOf course, the whole point of thyroid hormone is to increase the metabolic rate in response to the brain’s perception that ATP extraction from food is efficient and that there is enough food, and thus food molecules should be burned in a big metabolic fire to make and use lots of ATP.\n\nSo, all roads that lead to increased energy metabolism in the hair follicle support hair growth.\n\nA beautiful head of hair is biological peacocking, the original form of peacocking, bragging to everyone around you that you have extra ATP the way some people buy Lambos and boats to show off their extra cash. There is a small but compelling dataset suggesting iron is commonly the limiting nutritional factor for ATP production in the hair follicle and that optimizing iron status is often the lowest-hanging fruit to improve energy metabolism and reduce hair loss. Optimizing iron status should be done with the Cheat Sheet along with the new “Key Insights” bulleted out in the Understanding Iron article.\n\nSubtitle: This is the best-supported nutritional deficiency that can drive hair loss.\n\nDescription: This is the best-supported nutritional deficiency that can drive hair loss.",
