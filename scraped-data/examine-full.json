It does this mainly by increasing energy availability during high-intensity activity. Creatine may also provide cognitive and mental health benefits in some contexts.\n\nRecent updates 3 days ago Examine Database update\n\nWhat is creatine? What are creatine’s main benefits? What are creatine’s main drawbacks? How does creatine work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer There are many different forms of creatine available on the market, but creatine monohydrate is the most extensively researched and tends to be the cheapest form. Another option is micronized creatine monohydrate, which dissolves more easily in water.\n\nIn most studies, supplementation involved an initial loading protocol of around 0.3 grams per kilogram of bodyweight per day (typically divided into four equal doses throughout the day) for 5–7 days followed by a daily maintenance dose of at least 0.03 g/kg of bodyweight. For a 180 lb (82 kg) person, this translates to a loading dose of 25 g/day and a maintenance dose of at least 2.5 g/day. The “alternative” to creatine loading involves simply taking a smaller dose (usually 3–5 g) of creatine every day.\n\nDo I need to load creatine? What is the best form of creatine? Does caffeine counteract creatine’s ergogenic effects? What are the main dietary sources of creatine? How much creatine do I need?

    "content": "Supplements Caffeine Evidence-based Caffeine Written by: Thomas Solomon , Giulia Guerrini + 2 + 2 others Fact-checked\n\nCaffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that can improve sports performance and aspects of cognitive function. Caffeine or caffeine-containing beverages are often taken to help restore alertness and wakefulness or to reduce drowsiness . Despite its side effects, caffeine is safe for most people, and caffeine-containing beverages like tea and coffee are socially acceptable and widely used.\n\nLast Updated: November 19, 2025\n\nOverview What is caffeine? What are caffeine’s main benefits? What are caffeine’s main drawbacks? How does caffeine work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer For sports performance The optimal dose for sports performance benefits is 3–6 mg per kilogram of bodyweight (approximately 200–400 mg in a 70 kg person), taken around 60 minutes before exercise. [1] Using a dose at the low end of this range, approximately 3 mg/kg of caffeine before exercise (approximately 200 mg in a 70 kg person), achieves the benefits along with the lowest risk of side effects. [2]\n\nCaffeine is generally safe for most people if used within the recommended amounts. [3] [4] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report that a daily total caffeine intake of up to 400 milligrams (mg) does not raise safety concerns for non-pregnant adults. [5] [6] The EFSA further reports that a daily total caffeine intake of up to 200 mg in pregnant and lactating women does not increase safety concerns for unborn babies or breastfed infants, and that a single caffeine dose of up to 200 mg (approximately 3 mg per kg bodyweight for a 70-kg adult) does not raise safety concerns. [5] In other words, caffeine intake is unlikely to cause detrimental health effects if daily intake is below 400 mg/day in non-pregnant adults, or below 200 mg/day in pregnant/lactating women, and if a single dose is less than 200 mg.\n\nIn children and adolescents, more research is needed to clarify safety, health risks, and tolerable upper intake limits. [5] Evidence from a systematic review suggests that children and adolescents should consume no more than 2.5 mg per kg of bodyweight per day (equivalent to 100 mg for a 40 kg person). [3] But some organizations discourage all consumption of caffeine and other stimulants by children and adolescents. [6]\n\nCaffeine concentrations in various foods — coffee, tea, soft drinks (cola), chocolate, energy drinks, etc — are highly variable. [5] For example, a cup of coffee may contain approximately 50–200 mg of caffeine, but the amount per cup is highly variable depending on the type of bean, how it is roasted, and how it is prepared. [7] [8] Some energy drinks contain very high amounts of caffeine, and the FDA recommends avoiding dietary supplements that contain pure or highly concentrated caffeine because a single teaspoon of pure powdered caffeine contains about 5 grams (5000 milligrams), far higher than the upper recommended limit of daily intake and approaching the toxic dose. [9]\n\nFor a detailed overview of caffeine dosing, read our article “How Much Caffeine Is Too Much?” .\n\nNote that caffeine citrate is about 50% caffeine by weight, i.e., a 50 mg dose of caffeine citrate contains approximately 25 mg of caffeine. [10] [11]\n\nDo different genotypes influence the effect of caffeine? Does regular caffeine use reduce the benefit of caffeine on exercise performance? Does regular caffeine use reduce the risk of cognitive disorders like dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease? Is caffeine a banned substance for athletes? Does coffee have the same effect as isolated caffeine on exercise performance?

It benefits us in many ways, from bone health to mood.\n\nOverview What is vitamin D? What are vitamin D’s main benefits? What are vitamin D’s main drawbacks? How does vitamin D work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Formulation Vitamin D supplements are available in two main forms: vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). Vitamin D3 supplementation is generally recommended over D2 supplementation, because D3 tends to raise blood levels more effectively. [1] [2]\n\nVitamin D comes in a wide range of formulations, including tablets, capsules, soft gels, drops, and powder.\n\nStudies have varied greatly in the dosages of vitamin D used, ranging anywhere from 400 IU (10 μg) daily to 300,000 IU (7,500 μg) daily — far beyond what is recommended! Sometimes vitamin D has been given at longer intervals, such as weekly, monthly, or even yearly. [4]\n\nMost people should consume at least the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin D, which includes vitamin D from all sources (i.e., food, drinks, supplements, and medications) combined. It is common for supplemental doses of vitamin D to exceed the RDA; however, it’s important not to exceed the tolerable upper intake level unless advised and monitored by a healthcare professional.\n\n* Adequate Intake (AI) ) Reference: Institute of Medicine. Dietary Reference Intakes for Adequacy: Calcium and Vitamin D (chapter 5 in Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D . The National Academies Press. 2011. DOI: 10.17226/13050 )\n\nReference: Institute of Medicine. Dietary Reference Intakes for Adequacy: Calcium and Vitamin D (chapter 6 in Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D . The National Academies Press. 2011. DOI: 10.17226/13050 )\n\nVitamin D is absorbed better when taken with food or a source of fat. [5] However, taking it with or without food is unlikely to have a large effect on its ability to increase vitamin D levels in the long run. [6] [7] [5]\n\nWhat are some dietary sources of vitamin D3? Should vitamin K be supplemented alongside vitamin D? Can vitamin D status affect testosterone levels? Is there a link between vitamin D levels and all-cause mortality? Can vitamin D supplementation improve symptoms of multiple sclerosis?

    "content": "Supplements Magnesium Evidence-based Magnesium Written by: Brady Holmer , Thomas Solomon + 2 + 2 others Fact-checked\n\nMagnesium is an essential dietary mineral that is involved in energy production, nervous system function, blood pressure regulation, and blood glucose control. A lack of magnesium in the diet — which is common in modern societies — is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other health conditions.\n\nOverview What is magnesium? What are magnesium’s main benefits? What are magnesium’s main drawbacks? How does magnesium work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Formulation: Dosage forms of magnesium include oral preparations such as tablets, capsules, powders, liquids, and effervescent tablets as well as topical preparations.\n\nMagnesium supplements come in a variety of salt forms that differ in how well they’re absorbed (their bioavailability ), the amount of elemental magnesium they provide, and their physiological effect. Common forms include magnesium oxide, magnesium citrate, magnesium glycinate, magnesium bisglycinate, and magnesium chloride.\n\nWhich form of magnesium is best for increasing magnesium levels?\n\nMagnesium citrate is one of the most-studied forms of magnesium and consistently shows good bioavailability. [1] Magnesium chloride, magnesium gluconate, magnesium lactate, magnesium glycinate, and magnesium aspartate also appear to have good bioavailability. [2] [1] [3] On the other hand, magnesium oxide and magnesium carbonate have extremely poor absorption and aren’t recommended for the purpose of increasing magnesium levels in the body. They also have an increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects. [2]\n\nReference: Ranade et al. Am J Ther . 2001. [2]\n\nAlthough magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) is often used in bath preparations to soothe achy and sore muscles, there’s a lack of evidence to support the transdermal (through the skin) absorption of magnesium. [4] A warm soak might be relaxing, but it’s not due to the magnesium.\n\nDoses used in studies have ranged from 30 to 960 milligrams per day (mg/day) of elemental magnesium.\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of magnesium is the amount that should be consumed to meet the nutritional requirements of most people. It includes magnesium from all sources, including food, beverages, supplements, and medications. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for magnesium only includes magnesium obtained from dietary supplements and medications. Supplement doses exceeding the UL are more likely to cause adverse effects.\n\n* Adequate intake (AI) Reference: Institute of Medicine.

Consequently, it plays many roles, including in antioxidant enzymes, brain function, and the immune system. Zinc is most commonly taken to reduce the duration of respiratory infections and the common cold.\n\nLast Updated: November 19, 2025\n\nOverview What is zinc? What are zinc’s main benefits? What are zinc’s main drawbacks? How does zinc work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Zinc supplements vary in their dosages from 5–10 milligrams (mg) up to 25–45 mg of elemental zinc , and sometimes higher. Dosages in the lower range are typically used as a daily preventative , whereas dosages in the higher range are typically used to treat chronic conditions and zinc deficiency.\n\nCaution : The tolerable upper intake level of zinc is 40 milligrams per day (mg/day) in adults. [1] [2] This value represents the highest level of daily zinc intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all people. Although some clinical studies have used daily doses above 40 mg/day for up to 12 weeks, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] caution should be taken when supplementing with zinc at or above this dose because the risk of adverse effects increases.\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency?

    "content": "Supplements Ashwagandha Evidence-based Ashwagandha Written by: Daryl Nault , Katie Jantz + 1 + 1 other Fact-checked\n\nAshwagandha has been called the king of Ayurvedic herbs. It’s best known for reducing stress and anxiety. It may also modestly enhance various aspects of physical performance, increase testosterone levels, and improve reproductive health, but more research is needed to confirm these effects.\n\nLast Updated: September 4, 2025\n\nOverview What is ashwagandha? What are ashwagandha’s main benefits? What are ashwagandha’s main drawbacks? How does ashwagandha work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Formulation: Various parts of the ashwagandha plant are used, but the most common supplemental form is an extract of its roots that may come in a capsule, liquid extraction, tablets, or tea. When ashwagandha is used as part of the Ayurvedic system, it usually involves more than just the herb alone.\n\nBecause withanolides are considered to be the major active component in ashwagandha, some extracts are standardized to contain a certain or minimum amount. Clinical trials have used standardized extracts containing anywhere from 1.5% to 35% withanolides, but many studies do not disclose this information, and the optimal amount of withanolides is not yet clear. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Note that while studies may use standardized extracts or proprietary formulas, variations in extraction methods, formulation, or composition can affect the physiological response.\n\nStudies on ashwagandha have used daily dosages ranging from 120 to 12,000 mg of a root extract. The most common dosing protocol is 150 to 600 mg daily, and this may be divided into one to three doses. [8] [9] [5]\n\nAdults: In studies in adults (ages 18–65+), ashwagandha given in dosages from 120 to 600 mg per day, for 4 to 12 weeks’ duration, has shown effectiveness for the relief of stress and reduction of cortisol . In these studies, both capsules and root powder were taken once or twice daily with water. [10] [11] [10] [9] [12] [13] [14] [15]\n\nAdults: In studies in adults (ages 18–65+) both with and without insomnia , ashwagandha given in dosages from 120 to 1,250 mg per day (most commonly 600 mg per day) for 4 to 12 weeks’ duration has shown effectiveness for improving alertness / fatigue , sleep quality , sleep duration , and sleep disturbances . [5] Standardized capsules of root extract were used in the overwhelming majority of studies, taken once or twice daily in combination with milk or water. [8] [16] [10] [17] [18] [19] [5]\n\nSpecial considerations: The trials used different standardized extracts, some coming from root only and others from both root and leaves. This may result in different phytochemical profiles .\n\nMen: Men (ages 18–64) who took ashwagandha in dosages from 600 to 5,000 mg per day for 8–12 weeks’ duration saw increases in sexual function , fertility , and testosterone levels. Root extract capsules or powder were taken once or twice daily. [7] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [14] [5]\n\nWomen: Women (ages 18–64) who took 300 mg of ashwagandha root extract twice a day saw increases in estrogen and sexual function as well as decreases in follicle-stimulating hormone , luteinizing hormone , and menopausal symptoms . [28] [29]\n\nAdults: In studies in adults (ages 18–65+) both with and without anxiety / depression , ashwagandha given in dosages from 120 to 1,000 mg per day (with one outlier giving 12,000 mg per day) for 4 to 12 weeks’ duration was effective for reducing symptoms of anxiety and improving cognition. Capsules of root extract were taken once or twice daily in combination with milk or water.

[9]\n\nAdults: In studies in adults (ages 18–65+) without known health conditions, ashwagandha given in dosages ranging from 60 to 1,000 mg per day (once or twice daily) for 4 to 16 weeks’ duration has been effective in altering markers of immune function. Capsules, root powder, and tablets were used in these studies that saw increased lymphocytes ( CD3 , CD4 , and CD8 ), immunoglobulin A , immunoglobulin G , immunoglobulin M , interleukin 4 , and natural killer cells and decreased signs of oxidation and inflammation. [42] [11] [4] [43] [20] [44]\n\nAdults: In studies in both trained and untrained adults (ages 18–64), ashwagandha given in dosages from 120 to 1,250 mg per day for 2 to 8 weeks’ duration has shown effectiveness for improving aerobic exercise metrics , exercise recovery, and physical strength. In these studies, capsules were taken once or twice per day. [6] [45] [46] [47] [48] [11] [5] [26]\n\nIt is unknown if ashwagandha loses its potency with daily long-term use, but due to its possible drug-like effects on neurotransmission, this possibility cannot be ruled out. It’s also unknown if taking breaks from ashwagandha or taking it every other day prolongs its effectiveness. Whether ashwagandha is taken with milk or water could potentially affect its absorption. More research is needed to confirm whether dosages above 600 mg daily yield greater benefits.\n\nWhat are the known traditional, historical, and cultural uses of ashwagandha? Does ashwagandha affect hormone health? Does ashwagandha affect general mental and brain health? Does ashwagandha affect specific mental health conditions? Does ashwagandha affect brain health?

    "content": "Supplements Melatonin Evidence-based Melatonin Written by: Morgan Pfiffner , Katie Jantz Fact-checked\n\nMelatonin is a hormone secreted in the brain that regulates sleep. It appears to be highly sensitive to light therapy and dark therapy . Oral ingestion of melatonin may be used as a sleep aid. It is non-addictive.\n\nLast Updated: September 4, 2025\n\nOverview What is melatonin? What are melatonin’s main benefits? What are melatonin’s main drawbacks? How does melatonin work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer For regulating the sleep cycle and improving sleep disorders, doses of melatonin between 300 micrograms (μg) and 5 mg have been shown to work. [1] [2] Start with 300 μg, and work up to 5 mg as needed. The benefits of melatonin are not dose-dependent — taking more will not help you fall asleep faster. That said, the most effective dose is an area of ongoing research.\n\nTo help with sleep, take roughly 30 minutes before going to bed, although some people may benefit from taking melatonin as much as 3 hours earlier.\n\nIs melatonin found in food? Can melatonin help with jet lag or shift work? Can a combination of melatonin and cannabidiol (CBD) help with sleep? Can melatonin affect dreams? Will supplementing melatonin affect my own production of melatonin?

It has anti-inflammatory properties and can alleviate symptoms of depression as well as improve pain and function in people with osteoarthritis .\n\nLast Updated: December 18, 2025\n\nOverview What is curcumin? What are curcumin’s main benefits? What are curcumin’s main drawbacks? How does curcumin work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer The recommended dosage of curcumin for inflammation can vary. Studies have used daily doses ranging from 300 mg to 4,000 mg, depending on the specific condition. [1] When orally ingested alone, curcumin is poorly absorbed. The two most commonly used and most frequently tested methods for improving absorption are to pair curcumin with piperine (a black pepper extract) or to combine it with lipids (e.g., BCM-95 ® , or Meriva ® ).\n\nTo supplement with curcumin with piperine , take 500 mg of curcumin with 5 to 6.7 mg of piperine 3 times per day for a total dosage of 1,500 mg of curcumin and 15 to 20 mg of piperine per day.\n\nTo supplement with BCM-95 , a patented combination of curcumin and essential oils, take 500 mg twice a day for a total dosage of 1,000 mg/day.\n\nTo supplement with Meriva , a patented combination of curcumin and soy lecithin, take 200 to 500 mg twice a day for a total dosage of 400–1,000 mg/day.\n\nCurcumin is sold in tablets, capsules, soft gels, powder, and drop form and is usually taken alongside food.\n\nWhat are the benefits of phytosomal curcumin?

It reduces triglycerides , but does not seem to affect the rate of cardiovascular events. It appears to reduce the symptoms of depression and improve some painful, inflammatory conditions.\n\nOverview What is fish oil? What are fish oil’s main benefits? What are fish oil’s main drawbacks? How does fish oil work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Fish oil doses vary depending on the goal of supplementation. For general health, 250 mg of combined EPA and DHA is the minimum dose and can be obtained via fish intake. The American Heart Association recommends 1 g daily.\n\nSince fish oil is a combination of two different fatty acids, these numbers reflect a combined total. Total eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) consumption should come from a mix of real food and supplements. The more EPA and DHA is provided by the diet, the less supplementation is required.\n\nFish oil can be taken throughout the day. To minimize the \"fish burp\" taste, take fish oil with meals.\n\nPregnant women should increase their intake of DHA by at least 200mg a day, as long as there is no risk of elevated mercury levels.\n\nDoes fish oil really help depression?

What are vitamin B12’s main benefits? What are vitamin B12’s main drawbacks? How does vitamin B12 work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of vitamin B12 is 2.4 μg for adults without known health conditions. During pregnancy, the RDA increases to 2.6 μg. [1] For children 8 years and under, the RDA is 1.2 μg. [1] Supplementing with B12 is probably not helpful in people who are able to get enough of the vitamin through their diet and have no difficulty with absorption.\n\nSupplements that are available over the counter contain 500–2000 μg of vitamin B12 per tablet. Long-term use is not recommended without monitoring of vitamin B12 levels.\n\nFor replenishing stores of vitamin B12, 1000 μg should be given by intramuscular injection three times per week for two weeks. This can then be done weekly for four weeks, then once monthly. In cases where absorption is not an issue, the maintenance dose can also be given orally.

    "content": "Supplements Iron Evidence-based Iron Written by: Wyatt Brown , Giulia Guerrini + 2 + 2 others Fact-checked\n\nIron is an essential mineral best known for helping red blood cells to carry oxygen. Except in the case of deficiency, iron supplementation has no proven benefit; on the contrary, it can lead to side effects and increased oxidative stress.\n\nLast Updated: December 18, 2025\n\nOverview What is iron? What are iron’s main benefits? What are iron’s main drawbacks? How does iron work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer The recommended daily allowance (RDA) depends on gender, age, and whether you are pregnant or lactating: [1] [2]\n\nThese values correspond to the RDA for total iron, which encompasses both dietary iron (iron assimilated from iron-rich foods) and iron supplements. The need for supplementation depends on the amount of iron absorbed from one&#x27;s diet. It’s important to avoid exceeding the RDA to prevent excessive iron intake. [1]\n\nNotably, for infants up to 6 months of age, these values specifically refer to adequate intake (AI), because there is insufficient evidence to establish an RDA for this age group. [1] The Institute of Medicine (IOM) determined the daily AI by multiplying the average iron content in human milk (0.35 mg/L) by the average milk intake of exclusively breastfed infants (0.78 L/day), resulting in an AI of 0.27 mg/day of iron. These values don’t account for potential variations in the iron concentration of human milk. [3]\n\nFor preterm breastfed infants, a daily oral iron dosage of approximately 2 mg/kg is estimated to be appropriate for preventing iron deficiency (ID) or iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in preterm breastfed babies. Term breastfed infants typically do not require additional iron until around 4 months, at which point supplementation with 1 mg/kg of iron may or may not be required depending on the infant&#x27;s health status. Formula-fed preterm and term infants may require different dosages if iron supplementation is needed. [2]\n\nIt is worth noting that iron is most effective when administered on an empty stomach or 2 hours after a meal. However, if iron supplements are poorly tolerated due to gastrointestinal side effects, a dose reduction or administration after a meal may be more suitable.

    "content": "Supplements Calcium Evidence-based Calcium Written by: Daryl Nault , Gregory Lopez Fact-checked\n\nCalcium is a macromineral that can be obtained through the diet, particularly in dairy products and, to a lesser extent, vegetables. It’s primarily used to support bone health, and there is some evidence that it supports cardiovascular health and women’s health.\n\nLast Updated: December 18, 2025\n\nOverview What is calcium? What are calcium’s main benefits? How does calcium work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Formulation: Supplemental calcium is usually recommended when dietary calcium is insufficient, and it is most frequently found as calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. [1] [2] Forms of calcium supplements that may also be available include calcium phosphate, calcium lactate, calcium gluconate, and coral calcium. [1] Different forms of oral calcium supplements have their own benefits and drawbacks. Coral calcium and calcium citrate, for example, may be better absorbed than calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is, on the other hand, less expensive than other forms, making it more accessible. [3] [4] Standalone calcium citrate supplements may be more readily used by the body than calcium carbonate. The exception to this seems to be in calcium-fortified foods, where calcium carbonate is absorbed better. [5]\n\nCurrent meta-analyses have reported on studies that cover a wide range of calcium supplementation dosages, from a low dose of 162 mg per day all the way up to 7,700 mg per day. In many of these studies, calcium was taken with vitamin D3 ranging from 400 to 1,000 IU per day. Ranges studied for skeletal health, pregnancy-related concerns, digestion, metabolism, and body mass are similar (about 200 to 2,000 mg per day), but cardiovascular health uses a higher range (500 to 7,700 mg per day).\n\nDoes calcium affect bone health?

    "content": "Supplements Vitamin K Evidence-based Vitamin K Written by: Thomas Solomon , Louie Neri Fact-checked\n\nVitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a key role in blood coagulation , bone metabolism, and vascular health. Vitamin K1 is found in many leafy greens and soy, while vitamin K2 is found in meat and fermented foods and is synthesized by intestinal bacteria. Supplementation with vitamin K improves markers of bone health , and vitamin K is administered to newborns to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding.\n\nLast Updated: September 4, 2025\n\nOverview What is vitamin K? What are vitamin K’s main benefits? What are vitamin K’s main drawbacks? How does vitamin K work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Formulations:\n\nVitamin K interacts with several drugs, including blood-thinning (anticoagulant) drugs like warfarin and drugs that affect the intestinal absorption of dietary fat, such as colesevelam and orlistat . Vitamin K absorption and metabolism can be impaired in people with hepatobiliary dysfunction . A tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin K has not been set, because there is insufficient data assessing the risk. [1] [2] This does not mean that taking an amount higher than the recommended dose is safe, just that current data does not find adverse effects.\n\nThe dosages that have been found to improve markers of bone health are 0.1–5 mg/day (100–5000 μg/day) of phylloquinone (vitamin K1), 15–45 mg/day of menaquinone-4 (vitamin K2), or 100–375 μg/day of menaquinone-7 (vitamin K2). [3] [4] [5]\n\nThe adequate intake (AI) — the daily intake that ensures nutritional adequacy in most people — in micrograms (µg) per day for vitamin K is shown below. [1] [2] Note that the AI for vitamin K varies slightly between countries; the data below are for the US.\n\nVitamin K is found in several foods. High amounts per serving are found in spinach, broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts, collards, soybeans, etc. [6] [7] [8] [9] Consult the FoodData Central database to check the amounts of vitamin K in the foods you eat.\n\nTake with food: Yes. Intestinal absorption of vitamin K appears to be improved in the presence of dietary fat. [10]\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of vitamin K deficiency? What causes vitamin K deficiency?

    "content": "Supplements Beta-Alanine Evidence-based Beta-Alanine Written by: Brady Holmer , Antonis Damianou + 1 + 1 other Fact-checked\n\nBeta-alanine is a building block of carnosine , a molecule that helps buffer acid in muscles. Beta-alanine supplementation improves performance during high-intensity exercise lasting from 1 to 10 minutes. Carnosine also has antioxidant effects and may be beneficial for aging and neurological conditions.\n\nLast Updated: September 4, 2025\n\nOverview What is beta-alanine? What are beta-alanine’s main benefits? What are beta-alanine’s main drawbacks? How does beta-alanine work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Studies have found a range of 3.2–6.4 grams per day of beta-alanine to be effective for enhancing exercise performance. [1] To optimize carnosine stores, a chronic loading dose of 4–6 grams per day of beta-alanine divided into doses of 2 grams or less for a minimum of 2 weeks is suggested — this results in a 20%–30% increase in muscle carnosine stores, while a 40%–60% increase is observed after 4 weeks. [2] A larger dose of 6 grams per day divided into 4 equal doses (1.5 grams each) is more advantageous.\n\nTo avoid paresthesia, a dose of 0.8–1.6 grams of beta-alanine every 3–4 hours is recommended. There are also sustained-release formulations available that permit the use of greater doses without the risk of paresthesia. [3] [4] Although beta-alanine is commonly included in preworkout supplements, the timing of ingestion does not influence its effectiveness.\n\nCombining beta-alanine supplementation with creatine may enhance its effectiveness. [5] Furthermore, carnosine levels may increase to a greater extent when beta-alanine is co-ingested with a meal containing carbohydrates and protein [6] or when taken with caffeine, [1] though there isn’t much research in support of these effects.\n\nWhy do we supplement with beta-alanine instead of carnosine? What are the main food sources of beta-alanine/carnosine? Should vegetarians/vegans supplement with beta-alanine? What are other names for Beta-Alanine?

It is efficiently turned into L-arginine in the kidneys after supplementation, which makes it a good choice for increasing nitric oxide synthesis in the body.\n\nLast Updated: September 4, 2025\n\nOverview What is citrulline? What are citrulline’s main benefits? What are citrulline’s main drawbacks? How does citrulline work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer To supplement L-citrulline for circulatory health or to alleviate erectile dysfunction, take 2,000 mg of citrulline, three times a day with meals, for a total daily dose of 6,000 mg. L-citrulline does not need to be taken with meals, however.\n\nTo supplement for circulatory health with a citrulline malate supplement, take 1.76 g of citrulline malate for every 1 gram of citrulline you would normally take.\n\nTo supplement L-citrulline to enhance sports performance, take 6,000 – 8,000 mg of citrulline malate about an hour before exercise. On days that you don&#x27;t exercise, it can be broken up into smaller doses.\n\nWhat’s the difference between L-citrulline and citrulline malate? Which foods are rich in citrulline?

It is best known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, despite a long history of traditional use, there’s very little high-quality human research on it.\n\nLast Updated: September 4, 2025\n\nOverview What is shilajit? What are shilajit’s main benefits? What are shilajit’s main drawbacks? How does shilajit work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Shilajit is usually processed into a powder or taken in a purified resin form. The exact composition of shilajit can vary based on geographical region, which may also impact its biological effects. [1] Ideally, a product should be standardized to contain a certain amount of fulvic acid, DBPs, and DCPs. For example, PrimaVie — a patented, purified shilajit extract used in many trials — is standardized to contain ≥50% fulvic acid and ≥10.3% DBPs/DCPs.\n\nIn clinical trials, shilajit dosing has ranged from 200 to 2000 mg daily, although the most commonly used dosing regimen seems to be 500 mg daily, split into two daily doses.

It might as a byproduct of its anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nWhat is boron? Boron is a trace mineral with biological effects, though its essentiality is debated.\n\nIt seems to be able to reduce levels of inflammatory markers, and may reduce rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis , and menstural cramps, though much more research is needed before we can be confident in these benefits. It also might have a small positive effect on LDL-cholesterol , but this is far from certain.\n\nIt seems to be generally safe, though human research on its adverse effects is lacking, so smaller doses may be warranted.\n\nThe lowest active dose of Boron supplementation appears to be 3mg, which is effective in supporting hormonal parameters in postmenopausal women. Studies on osteoarthritis have used 6mg of Boron while studies in youth investigating hormonal changes have used 10mg.\n\nThe optimal dose is currently not known, but the above doses appear to be active for their aforementioned goals.\n\nAdd note Share © 2011– 2026 Examine.com Inc.

    "title": "HMB - Examine Research",
    "content": "Supplements HMB Evidence-based HMB Written by: Giulia Guerrini , Shayne McKee Fact-checked\n\nHMB is a metabolite of the essential amino acid leucine that plays an anticatabolic role in muscle tissue. In addition to preventing muscle protein breakdown, HMB may help improve strength and muscle mass in older adults, but evidence of a benefit for athletes is lacking.\n\nLast Updated: September 4, 2025\n\nOverview What is HMB? What are HMB’s main benefits? What are HMB’s main drawbacks? How does HMB work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Supplementation of HMB tends to be in the dosage range of 1–3 grams daily for the purpose of reducing muscle mass losses over time (anticatabolic). As HMB is said to be 20-fold more potent than leucine for this purpose, it is seen as equivalent to 20–60g of leucine supplementation. [1]\n\nHMB, a water-soluble metabolite of leucine, is excreted in the urine and is not reabsorbed by the kidneys back into the bloodstream. Studies have shown that approximately half of the supplemented HMB is lost through urine. Since the kidneys don’t reabsorb HMB, dividing the daily HMB dosage into three separate doses throughout the day may help to maintain steadier levels of HMB in the blood and thereby enhance its effectiveness. [2] [3]\n\nFor the purpose of muscle protein synthesis (MPS), HMB and leucine are fairly equivalent, although the latter ( leucine ) may be more potent on a per-gram basis. Supplementing with HMB is not advised for inducing muscle protein synthesis, since leucine is likely more effective as well as cheaper.\n\nSupplementation of HMB prior to an exercise session to mitigate exercise-induced muscle damage would require the usage of an HMB free acid rather than a calcium salt, and the above dosage range still holds. For this specific purpose, HMB is to be taken 30–60 minutes before a workout when taking the HMB-FA form, or 60–120 minutes if taking the HMB-Ca form. On the other hand, when HMB is consumed in preparation for a potentially skeletal-muscle-damaging event (e.g., a competition), or prior to a high-intensity training bout for the purpose of reducing muscle damage, it appears to be more effective when taken regularly three times a day starting at least 2 weeks before the training period.

    "content": "Supplements Vitamin C Evidence-based Vitamin C Written by: Katherine Nguyen , Louie Neri + 1 + 1 other Fact-checked\n\nVitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is an essential vitamin and a very popular supplement due to its antioxidant properties, safety profile, and low price. Many people supplement with vitamin C because it is believed to reduce symptoms of the common cold.\n\nOverview What is vitamin C? What are vitamin C’s main benefits? What are vitamin C’s main drawbacks? How does vitamin C work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer According to the WHO, most adults need only 45 mg of vitamin C per day, but more recent research has shown this number to be too low. The minimum has been set at 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men in the U.S., and 95 mg for women and 110 mg for men in the E.U.\n\nMoreover, a 2022 study using 110 mg as its starting number recommended adding 10 mg per 10 kg (22 lb) above 60 kg (132 lb) of body weight. [1]\n\nAny of these numbers are easily attained through the diet, so supplementation of such low doses is usually unnecessary. Higher doses of vitamin C, up to 2,000 mg, are used to support the immune system (for athletes) or reduce the duration of the common cold.\n\nMost studies on vitamin C prescribe one dose per day. The claim that taking 2,000 mg up to five times a day to optimally reduce cold symptoms is not sufficiently tested and requires more evidence.\n\nAre vitamin C supplements bad for your teeth?

Supplementing with extra vitamin E does not have broad health benefits, except in people with vitamin E deficiency, and long-term high-dose supplementation may cause harm.\n\nOverview What is vitamin E? What are vitamin E’s main benefits? What are vitamin E’s main drawbacks? How does vitamin E work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer Formulation: Tablets typically containing alpha-tocopherol.\n\n7 to 1,400 milligrams per day or 16.5 to 3111 international units (IU) per day.\n\nAdults: The effective dosage for improving TNF-Alpha and CRP is 500–700 mg/day (1,111–1,555 IU/day), by mouth, for at least 8 weeks. [2]\n\nSpecial considerations: It is currently uncertain whether the effect of reducing TNF-Alpha and CRP leads to improved health outcomes. [2]\n\nAdults: The effective dosage for improving AST and ALT (particularly in people with NAFLD ) is 180–360 mg/day (400–800 IU/day), by mouth, for at least 1 month. [3] [4]\n\nSpecial considerations: It is currently uncertain whether the effect of reducing liver enzymes in people with NAFLD leads to improved health outcomes. [4]\n\nWhat is the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin E?\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin E is as follows: [8]\n\n*Please note that the data for infants aged 0–12 months are adequate intake (AI) values, not RDA values.\n\nWhat is the tolerable upper intake level for vitamin E?\n\nThe tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin E is as follows: [8]\n\nWhat is vitamin E deficiency?

    "title": "Iodine - Examine Research",
    "content": "Share Link Email Add note\n\nIodine is an essential mineral in the diet due to its importance towards cognition and fetal development secondary to being required for thyroid hormones; iodine is central to the active thyroid hormones T3 and T4, and a true iodine deficiency results in less of these hormones and may result in reduced cognition (if a subclinical deficiency) or cretinism (severe deficiency in utero). Despite the importance of iodine, it is not a common dietary supplement. This is due to table salt being iodized (added iodine) and even relative deficiencies being quite rare in first world countries (it is a common issue in developing countries due to iodine only naturally occurring from fish and seaweed which may not be consumed); actually benefitting from supplementation of iodine requires a &#x27;perfect storm&#x27; of situations to occur which are outlined in the dosing section but not many people will meet these requirements. Supplementation of high doses of iodine in otherwise healthy people does not appear to result in much, since it is readily excreted and normalized. There may be a very small and (clinically) irrelevant antiinflammatory effect and a small reduction in thyroid hormones (rather than an increase), but that seems to be it. Obscenely high doses for a prolonged period of time, which occurs with consumption of unprocessed seaweed (mostly kombu) will result in benign goiter in all persons and thyrotoxicity in some persons with underlying thyroid issues.",

    "content": "Share Link Email Add note\n\nCopper is an essential trace mineral that is used in a variety of processes in the body. The major function for copper is in catalyzing oxidation-reduction (REDOX) reactions important for the activity of a number of enzymes. Although copper is essential to health, most Western diets meet the recommended intake, making supplementation unnecessary in most healthy individuals. Cases where copper deficiency may occur include patients who have undergone gastric bypass as well as chronic users of proton pump inhibitors, both of which interfere with copper absorption. Also, high levels of zinc intake may increase production of a protein known as metallothionein that can bind copper and reduce its levels in the body. Although the REDOX chemistry catalyzed by copper is essential for a number of immune functions, copper also may play a role in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Copper levels generally rise in the body with age, but seem to rise more sharply in those with Alzheimer&#x27;s. Moreover, copper levels have been linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s symptom severity, leading some to suggest that a lower copper intake may benefit the elderly.",

The supplement (saw palmetto) has a caloric value, as it is rich in fatty acids. Compounds in saw palmetto have the ability to block an enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ), the latter of which is more androgenic and can cause hair loss in the genetically susceptible. A couple of preliminary studies suggests supplementation with saw palmetto can promote hair regrowth, though more research is needed before strong conclusions can be made. Saw Palmetto&#x27;s effects on DHT production have also led to saw palmetto being used for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms in men. Some studies have shown positive results, but larger and more well-designed studies have brought its efficacy into question.",

    "content": "Supplements Chromium Evidence-based Chromium Written by: Katie Jantz , Louie Neri Fact-checked\n\nChromium is a mineral that occurs naturally in the earth’s crust and is found in small amounts in a variety of foods. Chromium supplementation seems to enhance the effects of insulin in the body, leading to improvements in insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation in people with insulin resistance . Although chromium has historically been considered an essential nutrient for the human body, current evidence challenges this notion.\n\nLast Updated: September 4, 2025\n\nOverview What is chromium? What are chromium’s main benefits? What are chromium’s main drawbacks? How does chromium work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer In research, chromium is generally supplemented at dosages ranging from 200–1000 µg daily. However, consistent dose-dependent responses haven’t been observed, and it’s unclear what an optimal dose of chromium might be. [1]\n\nSupplemental chromium is available in a variety of forms, with chromium picolinate, chromium nicotinate, chromium chloride, and chromium-enriched yeast being the most commonly studied forms. There isn’t clear evidence suggesting one form is the best. When taken orally, chromium in both food and supplements is poorly absorbed by the body, with absorption rates ranging from just 0.4% to 2.5%. [2] While it has been circulated in the literature that chromium picolinate has superior absorption, the study this is based on used unreliable methods to measure chromium levels and was funded by a manufacturer of chromium picolinate. [3] Other research suggests that chromium picolinate does not have superior bioavailability compared to other forms of supplemental chromium. [4] [5] [1]\n\nIn terms of dietary requirements, in 2001 the Institute of Medicine proposed an adequate intake of chromium to be 30–35 and 20–25 µg daily for men and women, respectively. However, due to a lack of clinical research, this was based on estimated average intakes in the United States. [6] In 2014, the European Food Safety Authority claimed that it was inappropriate to suggest an adequate intake level of chromium due to a lack of evidence for the beneficial role of chromium on human health. [7]\n\nWhy is it unclear whether chromium is essential for the body? Is chromium beneficial for dyslipidemia or high blood pressure? Is chromium beneficial for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? Does chromium improve athletic performance?

It is obtained in the diet and found in several foods. Potassium-containing drugs are sometimes used to treat certain conditions. Potassium salts (e.g. potassium chloride) are used in reduced-sodium added-potassium salt substitute interventions and in sodium restriction diets to help treat high blood pressure .\n\nOverview What is potassium? What are potassium’s main benefits? What are potassium’s main drawbacks? How does potassium work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer The adequate intake (AI) for potassium in people without known health conditions — i.e., the daily amount assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy — is as follows: [1]\n\nSome evidence suggests that dietary potassium insufficiency might be common: the global mean potassium intake has been estimated at 2250 mg/day, with only 35% of adults estimated to be achieving adequate intakes. [2]\n\nPotassium is found in many foods, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, meat, and animal products. [1] [3] Consult the FoodData Central database to check the amount of potassium in the foods you eat.\n\nPotassium supplements are generally safe for consumption and are unlikely to cause adverse effects if used within the recommended dosage. [4]\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of potassium deficiency? What is the effect of a reduced-sodium added-potassium salt substitute diet? Does low blood potassium cause exercise-associated muscle cramps? Are bananas high in potassium? What are other names for Potassium?

It’s a precursor to (i.e., is made into) estrogen and testosterone, and can exert weak benefits on its own. As an “antiaging” or performance enhancing supplement, its benefits are inconsistent.\n\nLast Updated: December 18, 2025\n\nOverview What is DHEA? What are DHEA’s main benefits? What are DHEA’s main drawbacks? How does DHEA work? Dosage Information Medical disclaimer DHEA has been studied at dosages of 25–200 mg/day, with dosages of 50–100 mg/day being more frequently examined. [1] [2] [3]\n\nA subgroup analysis in one meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that dosages of over 50 mg/day resulted in higher testosterone levels than less than 50 mg/day. [2] However higher dosages of DHEA are likely to result in higher levels of estrogens as well. [4]\n\nWhat are DHEA’s effects in older women? What are DHEA’s effects in older men?
