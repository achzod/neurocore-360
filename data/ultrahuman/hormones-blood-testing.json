The article explains what each hormone does, why it matters, and how abnormal levels affect health.\n\n## Core Hormones (Male & Female Panels)\n\n**Testosterone (Total & Free)**\n- Total testosterone includes bound and free portions\n- Free testosterone is biologically active and available to cells\n- Symptoms like fatigue and poor recovery often correlate more closely with free testosterone levels than total testosterone\n\n**SHBG (Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin)**\n- Liver-produced protein that binds sex hormones\n- High SHBG reduces available free testosterone\n- Associated with high estrogen, thyroid excess, or liver disease when elevated\n\n**DHEA-S (Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate)**\n- Adrenal-produced precursor hormone converted to testosterone and estrogen\n- Reflects adrenal function and androgenic capacity\n- Low levels may indicate chronic stress or aging\n\n**Cortisol**\n- Stress-response hormone regulated by the HPA axis\n- Follows natural daily rhythm: high morning, low evening\n- Chronic elevation can suppress testosterone and impair recovery\n\n**Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**\n- Pituitary-produced hormone controlling reproductive hormone production\n- In men: stimulates testosterone production\n- In women: triggers ovulation mid-cycle\n\n**Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)**\n- Pituitary hormone supporting fertility\n- In men: supports sperm development\n- In women: matures ovarian follicles\n\n**Prolactin**\n- Primarily known for milk production\n- Also regulates reproductive hormones in both sexes\n- Elevated levels suppress GnRH, disrupting reproductive signaling\n\n## Female-Only Hormones\n\n**Estradiol (E2)**\n- Primary estrogen in reproductive-age women\n- Regulates menstrual cycle, bone density, mood, and fat distribution\n- Test timing matters; optimal periods are early follicular or luteal phase\n\n**Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH)**\n- Reflects ovarian reserve and remaining egg supply\n- Stable throughout menstrual cycle\n- Useful for fertility assessment and egg freezing planning\n\n## Interconnected Systems\n\nThe article emphasizes that hormones operate through feedback loops. For example, investigating low testosterone requires examining LH and SHBG together. Irregular cycles warrant examining FSH, LH, estradiol, and AMH collectively. Energy and recovery issues may involve DHEA-S and cortisol patterns.\n\nBlood Vision maps endocrine system performance to identify where intervention might help.",
