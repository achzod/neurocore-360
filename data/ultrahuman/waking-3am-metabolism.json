When levels drop too low overnight, your body releases cortisol, adrenaline, and glucagon to correct it, often jolting you awake in the process.\n\nThis is sometimes referred to as the Somogyi Effect, and it's especially common in people with poor glycemic control or insulin resistance. So it could be worth trialling a CGM to get a better understanding of your metabolic health.\n\nOn the flip side, a different process — the Dawn Phenomenon — involves an early-morning rise in blood glucose triggered by circadian hormone release. Both patterns disrupt sleep, and both are tightly linked to what, when, and how much you eat in the evening.\n\nIt can also be other factors. Sleep quality can also suffer from erratic schedules, alcohol, or caffeine after noon.\n\nIf 3 AM wakeups are becoming routine, start by finishing your last meal at least three hours before bed and avoid late-night snacks that spike glucose before sleep.\n\nCommon Causes of 3 AM Wakeups\n\n1. Blood Sugar Instability\n\nA sharp drop in glucose overnight can trigger a release of cortisol, adrenaline, and glucagon to bring levels back up — and jolt you awake in the process. This counter-regulatory response is especially common if you've eaten a high-carb dinner or consumed alcohol before bed.\n\n2. The Dawn Phenomenon\n\nBetween 3 AM and 6 AM, your body prepares to wake by releasing cortisol and growth hormone — part of the natural circadian process. In some people, especially those with insulin resistance or suboptimal glucose control, this can cause an early spike in blood sugar and restlessness.\n\n3. Alcohol or Late Eating\n\nBoth alcohol and late-night meals disrupt melatonin production, increase core body temperature, and impair deep sleep. They can also delay the natural glucose drop and rebound pattern, increasing the likelihood of early waking.\n\n4. Cortisol and Stress\n\nChronic stress or poor sleep hygiene can lead to elevated nighttime cortisol, shifting your circadian rhythm, and reducing your ability to stay asleep through the early morning hours.\n\n5. Environmental Factors\n\nNoise, temperature shifts, or early morning light exposure (especially in summer) can prompt micro-awakenings or premature waking, especially if your sleep environment isn't optimized.\n\nHow to Solve 3 AM Wakeups\n\nAsk Yourself: Did you eat within 2–3 hours of bedtime?\nPossible Cause: Late eating / glucose instability\nNext Step: Shift your last meal earlier; reduce carbs at dinner\n\nAsk Yourself: Did you eat a long time (4-5 hours before bed?)\nPossible Cause: Glucose crash\nNext Step: Try a light snack an hour before bed to help glucose stability\n\nAsk Yourself: Did you consume alcohol or caffeine late in the day?\nPossible Cause: Stimulant/alcohol disruption\nNext Step: Avoid caffeine after 2 PM/skip alcohol within 4 hours of bed\n\nAsk Yourself: Are you under high stress or feeling anxious at night?\nPossible Cause: Elevated nighttime cortisol\nNext Step: Try a wind-down routine e.g. magnesium, breathwork, low light, no screens\n\nAsk Yourself: Do you feel hot or uncomfortable during sleep?\nPossible Cause: Thermoregulation issues\nNext Step: Lower room temp to 18–19°C – avoid heavy meals and alcohol\n\nAsk Yourself: Is your room exposed to light or noise early in the morning?\nPossible Cause: Environmental disruption\nNext Step: Use blackout curtains. Consider earplugs or white noise\n\nAsk Yourself: Have you recently changed time zones or your sleep schedule?\nPossible Cause: Circadian misalignment\nNext Step: Stick to consistent bed/wake times and get morning sunlight\n\nAsk Yourself: Do you have diabetes or suspect glucose control issues?\nPossible Cause: Dawn Phenomenon or Somogyi Effect\nNext Step: Monitor glucose trends. Consider a CGM and consult a healthcare provider\n\nSummary\n\nIf you're regularly waking up at 3 AM, your body is trying to tell you something, and it's often metabolic.\n\nRather than brushing it off, look at your routines. When you're eating, what you're drinking, how stressed you are, and whether your environment supports uninterrupted sleep.\n\nSmall, consistent changes can restore your rhythm. Start with earlier meals, reduce stimulants, and keep your sleep window consistent. Track patterns, experiment with adjustments, and talk to a professional if needed.\n\nAuthor: James Stables, Wearable Tech Expert and Content Lead at Ultrahuman\n\nPublished: July 20, 2025",
