Over time, repeated spikes may reduce insulin sensitivity and make blood sugar harder to regulate, leading to metabolic health issues.\n\nHow to pair your carbs\n\nAdd fiber, protein, or fat\n\nThese nutrients slow down glucose absorption and support a more stable response. Ideas include avocado or eggs on toast, or nuts in your oats.\n\nWatch your portions\n\nEven complex carbs can spike blood sugar if the serving is too large for your body's current glucose sensitivity or activity level.\n\nFavor complex over simple carbs\n\nWhole grains, legumes, and vegetables release glucose more gradually than refined options like white bread or fruit juice.\n\nOrder matters\n\nYour body handles the same foods differently depending on the sequence you eat them in.\n\nResearch shows that eating fiber first, then protein or fat, and carbs last can significantly improve your post-meal glucose response. This simple sequencing trick - sometimes called the \"food order\" method - slows gastric emptying and reduces the speed at which glucose enters your bloodstream.\n\nHow to apply it:\n\n- Start with fiber: A small green salad, sauteed vegetables, or a handful of raw carrot can prime your system.\n- Follow with protein or fat: Think grilled chicken, eggs, tofu, Greek yogurt, nuts, or avocado.\n- Finish with carbs: Save rice, bread, fruit, or starchy veg for the end of the meal.\n\nEven a few bites of fiber or protein before carbs can help. For example, eating a boiled egg or a few almonds before your toast, or having salad before your pasta, can flatten the glucose curve without changing what you eat.\n\nThis \"food flow\" slows gastric emptying and flattens the glucose curve, without changing what's on your plate.\n\nSummary\n\nCarbs on their own are a one-way ticket to a glucose spike, thanks to rapid absorption into the blood. Slowing that absorption by eating fats or protein first, can make a big difference to the size and severity of those spikes.",
