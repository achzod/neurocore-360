  "content": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV): What's Normal – and How to Increase It\n\nArticle by James Stables | Published June 18, 2025\n\nWhat is HRV?\n\nHeart rate variability measures the tiny differences in time between each heartbeat, in milliseconds. Even at a steady heart rate of 60 beats per minute, intervals between beats vary slightly—one gap might be 1.0 seconds, the next 1.1 seconds. This variability reflects how well your autonomic nervous system adapts to stress.\n\nThe Science Behind HRV\n\nThe autonomic nervous system controls involuntary processes through the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker). Two opposing branches create HRV dynamics:\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system drives the \"fight-or-flight\" response.\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system promotes \"rest and digest\" via the vagus nerve.\n\nHeart rate variability (HRV) reflects the constant push–pull between these two systems.\n\nWhat's Normal?\n\nHRV is highly individual. General age-based benchmarks include:\n\nMid-twenties: 55–105 average range\n\nSixties-seventies: 25–45 average range\n\nMales typically show slightly higher HRV than females.\n\nFactors Affecting HRV\n\nLow HRV can result from illness, stress, overtraining, menstrual cycle phases, alcohol, dehydration, heat, or chronic disease. Research shows drinking alcohol can lower HRV by approximately 22 milliseconds the following day.\n\nImprovement Strategies\n\nQuality sleep and wind-down routines\n\nCold exposure to stimulate the vagus nerve\n\nMindfulness practices (5-minute sessions showed benefits)\n\nResonant breathing at 5 breaths per minute\n\nThe article emphasizes tracking HRV over extended periods for meaningful health insights rather than relying on single measurements.",
