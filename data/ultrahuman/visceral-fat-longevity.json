Unlike subcutaneous fat beneath the skin, visceral fat lies deep within the body and cannot be seen externally. This fat is highly metabolically active, constantly releasing free fatty acids into the bloodstream.\n\n---\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Significant factors affecting longevity include gender, genetics, nutrition, physical activity, and lifestyle\n- Growing evidence implicates visceral fat as a major factor for type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease—all threats to longevity\n\n---\n\n## Visceral Fat and Proinflammatory Cytokines\n\nVisceral fat releases proinflammatory cytokines that stimulate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, crucial for the body's stress response.\n\nThese cytokines include adipokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and resistin. Simultaneously, there is a reduction in adiponectin (the \"fat hormone\"), which research associates with reduced insulin resistance.\n\nA protein called retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), secreted by visceral fat, increases insulin resistance.\n\nThe deep location of visceral fat enables it to directly affect organs. Inflammatory compounds drain into the liver, potentially causing fatty liver and pancreas, further disrupting insulin regulation. This can lead to type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease from excess glucose in the bloodstream.\n\nResearch establishes that abdominal visceral fat plays a more important pathogenetic role than subcutaneous fat in developing diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia (elevated blood lipids). Visceral fat accumulation in obesity associates with metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular disease risk.\n\n---\n\n## Visceral Fat and Ageing\n\nOne study demonstrates that caloric restriction delays age-related diseases and extends lifespan, while increased adiposity associates with enhanced disease risk and accelerated aging. Among fat deposits, visceral fat accumulation is a common aging feature, proving most detrimental to metabolic syndrome in aging humans.\n\nVisceral fat increases with age in both women and men. Beyond dietary causes—consumption of refined carbohydrates and sugar leading to excess calories—other contributors include chronic stress, physical inactivity, and inadequate sleep.\n\n---\n\n## Visceral Fat and Stress\n\nResearch shows stress leads to excess visceral fat storage. One study examines how visceral adiposity may be a physiological adaptation to stress. Under chronic stress, the body releases cortisol, activating the HPA axis, producing hyperphagic (overeating-related) and anti-thermogenic (heat-reducing) effects.\n\nGlucocorticoids (corticosteroids like cortisol involved in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism) affect abdominal fat more than subcutaneous tissue. Abdominal adipose tissue has more cells per mass unit, higher blood flow, and more glucocorticoid receptors.\n\nCushing's syndrome—characterized by excess cortisol—demonstrates the correlation between hypercortisolemia (prolonged elevated serum cortisol) and central adiposity accumulation.\n\nHervey's hypothesis suggests fat cells uptake and break down glucocorticoids, supporting the adaptive role of visceral fat in stress response. Evidence also shows abdominal obesity links to increased cortisol clearance.\n\nCortisol and insulin increase visceral fat, while growth hormones and sex hormones may prevent it.\n\n---\n\n## Visceral Fat and Fat Accumulation\n\nExcess visceral fat inhibits adiponectin, the \"fat hormone\" regulating fat. Insufficient adiponectin circulation may cause the body to accumulate excess fat.\n\nStudies demonstrate that visceral fat and adiponectin independently associate with metabolic risk factor clustering: high cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and abnormal LDL/HDL ratios.\n\n---\n\n## Visceral Fat and Cognition\n\nAccumulated visceral fat harms cognition. One study shows visceral fat allows inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta to heavily infiltrate the brain. This cytokine, produced by visceral fat, travels through the bloodstream, crosses the blood–brain barrier, and enters the brain, causing microglia dysfunction and impairing cognition.\n\nMicroglia are brain immune cells regulating neuronal function indirectly by clearing dead cells and extracellular debris, and directly by releasing signaling molecules supporting or suppressing neuroplasticity.\n\n---\n\n## Inflammation\n\nInflammation is the immune response to threats, injuries, or infections. During inflammation, inflammatory cells and cytokines release.\n\n### Acute and Chronic Inflammation\n\n**Acute inflammation** occurs with sudden body changes, damage, or injury. For example: cuts, infections, or workouts. The immune system sends proinflammatory cells to the area, then anti-inflammatory cells (prostaglandins) repair it.\n\n**Chronic inflammation** involves continuous inflammatory cell release and inflammatory response. Major sources include environmental stressors, toxins, and psychological stress. Shifts from short- to long-lived inflammatory responses cause immune tolerance breakdown, leading to oxidative stress and tissue/cell damage.\n\n---\n\n## Chronic Inflammation and Inflammaging\n\nChronic inflammation contributes to numerous metabolic diseases' pathophysiology. Systemic chronic inflammation leads to metabolic syndrome (hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia), cancer, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and autoimmune/neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nThe term \"inflammaging\" describes \"up-regulation of certain proinflammatory cytokines at older ages, and associated chronic diseases.\" Another definition: \"Human ageing is characterised by a chronic, low-grade inflammation termed 'inflammaging.'\"\n\nBlood cortisol levels increase with age, primarily from HPA axis activation by non-specific stressors. Over time, anti-inflammaging effects from cortisol produce tangible immunological function decreases. Coexisting anti-inflammaging and increased proinflammatory cytokines negatively impact metabolism, bone density, strength, exercise tolerance, vascular systems, cognitive function, and mood.\n\nThis dynamic \"together have a hand in controlling many of the progressive pathophysiological changes that characterise the 'aged-phenotype', and the struggle to maintain robustness finally results in frailty.\"\n\n---\n\n## Inflammation and Insulin Resistance\n\nInflammation critically impacts insulin resistance development through various established mechanisms. Highly processed, high-sugar foods trigger inflammation and proinflammatory compound release. These foods spike insulin; over time, such diets lead to insulin resistance.\n\nDietary fat may produce inflammatory molecules by modifying intestinal microbiota, triggering inappropriate immune reactions through processes like leaky gut, potentially causing autoimmune conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis.\n\nThe immune-metabolic cell interaction significantly disrupts metabolic homeostasis. High dietary saturated fatty acids or their metabolites activate immune sensors, triggering inflammatory cytokine synthesis in metabolic tissues. Intestinal microbiota producing inflammatory molecules can be modified by dietary fat, causing inappropriate immune reactions.\n\nInflammatory cytokines, saturated fatty acids, and lipopolysaccharides activate signaling pathways impairing insulin signaling, altering metabolic cell functions.\n\nPhysical exercise exhibits anti-inflammatory effects; exercise-induced cytokines impact cardiometabolic diseases. Interleukin-1β damages pancreatic β-cells; TNF-α is key in peripheral insulin resistance. According to research: \"TNF-α appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and heart failure.\"\n\n\"A marked increase in IL-6 and IL-10 is provoked by exercise and exerts direct anti-inflammatory effects by an inhibition of TNF-α and by stimulating IL-1ra, thereby limiting IL-1β signalling.\"\n\n\"Moreover, muscle-derived IL-6 appears to have direct anti-inflammatory effects and serves as a mechanism to improve glucose tolerance.\" Long-term exercise's indirect anti-inflammatory effects occur through body composition improvements and visceral adipose tissue reduction.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAging often associates with metabolic health deterioration. Increased adiposity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia cause and result from visceral adiposity and inflammation.\n\nChronic inflammation is metabolic syndrome's common feature. As visceral adipose tissue expands responding to chronic positive energy balance, inflammatory signals may originate within this depot. \"Both adipocytes and macrophages within fat secrete numerous hormones and cytokines that may contribute to the characteristic pathophysiologic changes seen in the metabolic syndrome and local inflammation within adipose\" tissue may be the sentinel event causing systemic insulin resistance and systemic inflammation—two metabolic syndrome cardinal features.\n\nResearch suggests: \"The metabolic alterations triggered by acute inflammation mimic the metabolic syndrome in many ways suggests that circulating cytokines, whether they are derived from adipose tissue or peripheral blood immune cells\", which \"may have similar metabolic effects on muscle, liver, and endothelium while potentially having differential effects on immune function.\"\n\nAdipocytes and macrophages within fat recognition exposes a paradigm wherein adipocyte-derived factors modulate local immune responses and macrophage-derived cytokines alter adipocyte differentiation and metabolic responses.\n\nA British Medical Journal meta-analysis screening 98,745 papers, focusing on 72 cohort studies worldwide with 2.5 million combined participants, found central adiposity consistently associates with higher premature mortality risk from all illnesses. Central fatness may associate more strongly with mortality risk than overall obesity.\n\nRegarding fat tissue: preventing new fat cell development or existing cell enlargement favoring repair-facilitating cells is possible. Research suggests: \"[C]ellular senescence could be an alternative cell fate involving [the] activation of proinflammatory responses owing to intra- or extracellular injury signals\" at any life stage.\n\n---\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis article provides general information and educational purposes only.
