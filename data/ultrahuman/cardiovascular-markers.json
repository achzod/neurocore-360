These tests can identify early warning indicators—such as impaired fat metabolism, inflammatory processes, or inherited risk factors—that may lead to heart disease even when individuals feel healthy. Ultrahuman's Blood Vision service offers comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation through 100+ biomarkers measuring longevity risk and underlying health conditions.\n\n### Blood Vision Cardiovascular Markers and Healthy Ranges\n\nA detailed reference table presents ten markers with their healthy ranges and clinical notes:\n\n#### 1. **Triglycerides**\nTriglycerides represent blood fat created when the body stores excess calories, particularly from sugar and processed carbohydrates. Following meals, surplus energy converts into triglyceride molecules for transport through the bloodstream. Persistently elevated levels suggest metabolic inefficiency and frequently signal insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Unmanaged elevation contributes to arterial stiffening (atherosclerosis) and raises heart attack or stroke danger.\n\n**Healthy range:** Under 150 mg/dL\n\n#### 2. **Total Cholesterol**\nThis aggregate measurement encompasses all blood cholesterol types: HDL, LDL, and other lipoproteins. While offering a preliminary assessment, it fails to differentiate between protective and damaging cholesterol types. Elevated total cholesterol may not independently indicate risk; the composition breakdown matters significantly.\n\n**Healthy range:** Under 200 mg/dL\n\n#### 3. **HDL Cholesterol (High-Density Lipoprotein)**\nHDL functions as a biological cleanup mechanism, eliminating cholesterol surplus from circulation and transporting it to the liver for elimination. Elevated HDL correlations indicate reduced heart disease risk, whereas diminished levels suggest compromised protective capacity, particularly among metabolically challenged or sedentary individuals.\n\n**Healthy range:** Above 50 mg/dL for females  \n**Moderate risk:** 40–50 mg/dL  \n**High risk:** Below 40 mg/dL\n\n#### 4. **LDL Cholesterol (Low-Density Lipoprotein)**\nLDL represents the cholesterol variant most responsible for arterial plaque accumulation, potentially narrowing blood vessels and amplifying heart attack and stroke risk. Termed \"bad\" cholesterol for this characteristic, lower amounts generally prove beneficial. However, the quantity of circulating LDL particles matters more than cholesterol content alone, which standard testing frequently overlooks.\n\n**Healthy range:** Under 200 nmol/L\n\n#### 5. **Non-HDL Cholesterol**\nCalculation involves subtracting HDL from total cholesterol. This measurement captures all harmful cholesterol particles—LDL, VLDL, and others—capable of causing arterial damage. Because it encompasses more particle types than LDL alone, it serves as a superior heart disease predictor, particularly for individuals with elevated triglycerides or metabolic complications.\n\n**Healthy range:** Under 130 mg/dL\n\n#### 6. **Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)**\nApoB is a protein component on all potentially harmful particles, including LDL and VLDL variants. Rather than quantifying cholesterol content, this assessment counts actual atherogenic particle numbers. This distinction proves critical: individuals may display normal LDL cholesterol while possessing elevated ApoB, indicating greater circulating particles and increased plaque formation potential. This marker ranks among cardiovascular risk's strongest predictors.\n\n**Healthy range:** Under 100 mg/dL\n\n#### 7. **Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]**\nLp(a) represents a genetically inherited LDL variant with supplementary protein, enhancing inflammation and blood clotting propensity. Unlike other cholesterol forms, Lp(a) levels remain largely genetically determined from birth and resist dietary or exercise modification. Elevated Lp(a) substantially increases heart attack and stroke risk, particularly among individuals appearing low-risk by conventional lipid measurements.\n\n**Healthy range:** Under 30 mg/dL\n\n#### 8. **Cholesterol/HDL Ratio**\nThis proportion compares total cholesterol against HDL levels, assessing protective versus harmful cholesterol equilibrium. Lower ratios typically indicate superior profiles with greater protective cholesterol relative to total amounts. Elevated ratios suggest cardiovascular danger even when total cholesterol appears acceptable.\n\n**Healthy range:** Under 7.4\n\n#### 9. **hs-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)**\nhs-CRP measures chronic, subtle bodily inflammation. Inflammation significantly contributes to heart disease through arterial wall weakening, plaque destabilization, and clot formation. Even with normalized cholesterol, elevated hs-CRP indicates concealed cardiovascular danger, signaling bodily inflammatory stress without specifying causation.\n\n**Healthy range:** Under 1.0 mg/L  \n**Moderate risk:** 1.0–3.0 mg/L  \n**High risk:** Above 3.0 mg/L\n\n#### 10. **Homocysteine**\nHomocysteine is an amino acid generated during protein metabolism. Typically, B vitamins (B6, B12, and folate) quickly neutralize it. However, accumulation damages blood vessels and elevates clotting danger. Research associates elevated homocysteine with amplified heart attack, stroke, and mental decline risk. Diet, genetics, kidney function, and vitamin levels all influence homocysteine concentrations.\n\n**Healthy range:** Under 10 µmol/L\n\n### Summary Recommendations\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing these markers function interconnectedly rather than isolation. Strategic focus areas include:\n\n- Reducing LDL, ApoB, triglycerides, and inflammatory markers (hs-CRP)\n- Elevating HDL levels\n- Obtaining non-HDL and ApoB measurements for comprehensive risk evaluation\n- Considering Lp(a) testing to identify inherited cardiovascular danger\n\nThe article notes \"no blood test result is a diagnosis\" but emphasizes collective evaluation assists physicians determining whether lifestyle interventions, supplements, or pharmaceutical treatments warrant implementation for disease risk reduction.",
